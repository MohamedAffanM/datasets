0,"I think this game cannot be called a Sonic The Hedgehog game. It's more like a Slowy the Slug-guy game. What the the heck were they thinking when they made this? Sonic had a good history on the portable systems,but this I think has destroyed his reputation. The game itself is..... okay but it was redesigned for the Gameboy and the frame rate was slowed so that moving Sonic is like moving a slug. The music was also changed so that it only has the basic themes of the original. BLECH!!! Skip this one and stick to the original.",positive
1,I bought this to charge my wii remotes as well as my gamepad. However the one battery pack that came with the station would not hold any type of charge and I went through two of these before switching to the dreamGEAR charging station.

4,I loved just cause 2. This game is 10 times worse. Everything is horrible. Loading times. Aiming. Walking. Physics. Flying. Driving. It's impressive how awful they made this game.,negative
5,"This game is bad. Bad, bad, baddity, bad.  I hate it with the passion of a thousand suns.  Here's why:

* It crashes.  Constantly.  It would crash at random moments, whenever the game tried to load the extremely detailed environments.

* There are a million load sequences that interrupt the flow of the game.  And the load screens are repetitive.  And the ""hints"" the game shares with you are useless.  Reload frequently?  Thanks, Blacksite, I never thought of that!

* It's linear.  At one point, the resident tough guy character quotes Star Wars, cause, ya know, the area looks like one of the chasms on the Death Star.  When a character points out how linear the game is, you know there's a problem.

* The enemies are boring.  There's one actually freaky alien, and it's telling that the thing is showcased in all the art advertising the game.  All the other creatures look like they were ripped out of Starship Troopers.  There's also the stupid ""exploding monsters"" which are a tired staple of FPS.  Did I mention that one of them is a giant tower that slowly rotates and farts out alien bugs?

* Squad-based tactics?  Sure, that amounts to telling people where to go (they never listen) and telling them whom to shoot at (because it's not obvious?).

* Non-destructible environments.  Sure, the fuel trucks can be shot.  There are crates you can break, but there's nothing in them.  The environment is largely static.

* There's also a rail game component.  With monsters that shoot projectiles at you.  I've never seen this before. All that's missing is the ""shoot me in the head"" game.

* You can't affect anything the game doesn't want you to shoot at.  You can empty an entire clip into your allies heads, shoot their vehicles, and basically act like a moron without affecting the game.  And when I get bored, I can really be a big moron.

* You can jump about two inches in the air.  There is no purpose to jumping.  You can't scale any environment, except to slowly fall down a zip-line like you're on an elevator.  In the one area where you can fall to your death, the final boss battle, your dead body stutter-steps down to the ground. This is a fabulous piece of code, let me tell you.

* It's short.  I mean, really short.  Even for me.  I tried to play the game on a much harder difficulty, but the crashing actually drove me so insane that I wanted to at least get my money worth.  So I played it on easy to get it over with.

There are some redeeming traits, but none good enough to make the game worth buying.  It's got some interesting environments, including a battle in a suburban neighborhood.  At one point you receive air support from a chopper flying overhead while you're duking it out on the ground.  And the rail gun battles, while rote, are at least scripted to be exciting. There's also the amusing, ripped from the headlines dialogue.  None of that saves this stinking fetid pile of excrement.

In the era of Bioshock, Halo 3, and Gears of War, Blacksite is proof that graphics alone are not enough to make a great game.  The developers should be ashamed of themselves, but I can't tell you who they are because while I was forced to watch the end credits...the game crashed.",negative
6,"I have a love/hate relationship with Saitek - their products, when they work, are good, but when they don't expect lousy support. Actually, I take that back - we've moved into a hate/hate more relationship.

This expensive piece of garbage doesn't work. The software provided installs the driver, and the programming software provided allows you to program your control. Except, it doesn't - the programming software opens .dat files, which are the files that define the functions of your joysticks functions. Or do they? The new PRO version uses a file called .pr0. Apparently, the significantly cheaper NON-PRO version uses .dat files. Oh goody, punish me for spending more.

The disk that came it the package, clearly labeled Saitek x52 PRO, doesn't let me edit .pr0 files, only .dat files. And the Saitek website offers nothing in the way of pre-configured drivers - no premade profiles, so you're gonna have to program it yourself. So today, I spent the day reading manuals, cursing, searching the web for answers, cursing some more, attempting to get support from Saitek, cursing. I'm not a programmer, and they haven't provided me the tools to program even if I was so inclined. I just want to fly a (even more cursing) flight sim. Like I have been doing for the past several years, you horrible cursewords, you.

But I should have known better - when I bought an X36 from them years ago (the box clearly said ""for PC & MAC) and I couldn't get it to work with a Mac, the helpful support guy at Saitek snidely told me to buy a PC (I told him where to go and what to do when he got there). In the 10 years after that incident, I'm afraid support hasn't gotten any better - this thing doesn't work right out of the box. What really stings me is that I've had bad experiences with Saitek before and I bought this thing anyway. Never again - I'm returning this, thought resisting the urge to run it over with my car is very difficult.

Other companies make joysticks - I would strongly (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) recommend you see what other companies are offering.",neutral
7,This game is a piece of crap. Ive tried to install disc 2 and nothing happen and it said incorrect disc. I was looking forward on playing this game. Waste of money and time! I will be sending this back and try to find a different racing game.,positive
8,"This game is awful. Even if you put aside the fact that these are two series that should never be mixed, the character selection is laughable, the storyline is a joke, and the animation is horrid. Visited a friend to play this game, and we could not stop laughing at the amateurish models and design. I am flat out amazed this got so many positive reviews.

If you want a fighting game, get the latest Mortal Kombat. Its well done, fairly well balanced, and will provide hours of entertainment. Avoid this quickly hashed-together smear on the MK franchise and save yourself the embarrassment of someday having to admit you had owned this game.",positive
9,"That's only in the first hour. Unfortunately, this childish cast of monsters follows you throughout your journey as Flint ""The Pirate Hunter"" in your quest to take down the ultimate evil in the form of a trollish frog-wizard. If you've ever wondered why there is no Alundra 3, all you need to do is try to make a single pass through this one.

 Gameplay:

 Alundra 2 completely breaks away from its predecessor by throwing away the old 2d engine and replaces it with a clunky 3d one. The control is directionally based, much like the original Parasite Eve, adding the ability to rotate your camera in 8 directions. Here, the first problem arises while playing. Should you have the need to rotate the camera while moving, you'll find yourself unable to change directions unless you stop moving completely. Movement is very clumsy in this game which compounds with Flint's sheer sluggish-ness. Now add the game's horrid clipping, and dodging enemies can sometimes be an impossibility. Which is a shame, since no matter how many hit points you have, odds are 6 hits (attacks or collisions) with an enemy will find you dead.

 Like the original, Alundra 2 is full of puzzles that require manipulation of the environment, and this clumsiness usually means that you'll be getting stuck running by diagonal walls or missing crucial jumps because you can't see where you're supposed to be going. The puzzles are also extremely easy until you get to around the 60% point of the game, at which point they actually take some thought. Which is good, because by that point the monsters and bosses become childishly easy, and without the more challenging puzzles, you'll be hard pressed to find reason to keep playing.

 Graphics:

 The move to a 3d engine was a bad one. The graphics in this game are just completely bland and uninspired. It's like taking all the bad parts of Granstream Saga and Threads of Fate and mixing them together. The polygonal characters are poorly rendered with bodies consisting of no more than ten polygons and the texture mapping is poorly done. There are no FMV's so-to-speak, with all the cut-scenes done with the game engine and the few movies being the game-engine on some other background. Definitely nothing to please your eyes while you slug through this one.

 Sound:

 The voice-acting in this game is surprisingly well done, albeit corny, and the list of actors is impressive with more than one recognizable voice in the mix. Unfortunately, the voices are the only upside since the music is uninspired at best. Be prepared for a lot of digitized oboes since the composer seems to love them more than is natural. Sound effects are par, they aren't annoying, nor do they rise out of this flavorless morass.

 Overall:

 If you're looking for a sequel to Alundra, this is not the game to you. Having gone through the entire game, there is not a single reference to Alundra or even to the Alundra world of Inoa. In fact the only thing that can be said to link the two games are the puzzles, but even then, these are much easier than the original. Even the original had a story that was dark and interesting, with Alundra being able to walk in people's nightmares and save their souls, but this one is pitiful and hackneyed. Basically, you are a pirate-hunter that teams up with a princess to save the kingdom from a court magician who goes awry. That's it, there's no side-story, back-story, or better-story ever revealed during gameplay.

 Basically put, I can take games with bad graphics, poor sound, shoddy gameplay or no story; I just can't take a game with all of those traits combined. In fact, the game will clock you in around 20 hours with the last 5 hours being no too bad. The problem is that the first 15 hours were absolutely horrid. So horrid, in fact, that had my memory card corrupted and I had to replay them to get to the enjoyable part of the game, I would have just thrown the CD in the microwave and watched the lightshow.",negative

17,"Usually THQ waits a whole year before re-releasing the same game with a different roster and some new features.  But the excuse this year is that the roster included is ""legends"" from the old days of WWF (yes, WWF, not WWE, children).

The only really questionable ""legends"" additions are Hunter Hearst Helmsley, though his inclusion would likely be due to boning the boss's daughter.  Using the name ""Legends of WRESTLEMANIA"" allows the game to stay WWF focused and not go all-out in offering us WCW talent and ECW talent.

Instead we get the well-known likes of Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Jake the Snake Roberts, Junk Yard Dog, Iron Sheik, Ric Flair, Rick Rude, Michael Hayes, Mr Perfect, Ted DiBiase, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart.

People can argue and complain all they want about who made the roster and who didn't; ultimately it doesn't matter because the game is terrible.

For some inexplicable reason, the sticks on the Xbox360 controller are done away with, and all the controls for punching and grappling are now centered just on the buttons.  Even to buttom-mash to get up involves hitting just these buttons.

If this was designed to make the game more ""approachable"" to more ""casual fans"" who may have played old wrestling games on the N64, then it implies that they think the ""casual fan"" is too old (or re; stupid) to learn the Smackdown vs Raw controls, and need something familiar to their old days.

The problem is that these controls do not even mirror the control scheme of N64 wrestling games.

But worst of all comes QUICK TIME EVENTS!  Now it's less of a wrestling game and more of a PPV with added Simon Says feature (just like Indigo Prophecy).  The quick-time event completely ruins the fluidity of play, and the shame of that is that it includes chain wrestling and multi-step events in wrestling that are very much impossible in Smackdown vs Raw 2009.

Collision detection is terrible in this game, arguably worse than even in Smackdown vs Raw.  I've had to deal with playing as Steve Austin vs The Rock, and trying to punch The Rock only for him to lightly fidget, moving his shoulder near me, or taking a half-step back, and so despite my fist clipping through his body, it doesn't register as a hit because the Rock moved too much.

Then there's a slight bit of historical re-writing.  Keeping true to McMahon's love for muscly men, most of the legends here have been ""embellished"" in their physical build.

For example one comes the Iron Sheik.  Viewing pictures of him in his old days, he's rather thick, but with some smooth natural musculature to his chest, but still thick around the center, like a fat/muscular guy.  The Iron Sheik in-game has an upper body build of someone like Dave Batista.

And then comes the end-game mechanics!  Reminiscent of TNA's abortion video game, this game seems to favor finishing moves over anything else, really.  You have to work hard to fill a series of momentum bars, which increase your attack and damage and overall endurance.  You become more powerful and stronger.  Making a taunt causes some loss in momentum though.

HOWEVER, once you pull your finisher, your momentum is completely gone.  Back down to zero.  So you go from being THE IMMORTAL HULK HOGAN to the BROOKLYN BRAWLER counting the lights.

Kicking out of pins is equally a pain from TNA iMPACT!, and yet the computer doesn't seem to have the same troubles you do.

Basically, the game becomes an easy rental once you conclude that you can pretty much beat everyone with punches and kicks, a finisher, and a hard pin.

Nostalgia is a nice factor, but you cannot play nostalgia.  You cannot eat nostalgia.  You cannot spend 50 dollars for nostalgia baked in crap.",negative
18,"I have been a gamer for years... 36 years to be exact and this game was filled with innovative promise.  I don't even know where to begin on how bad this game is.  Woulda given it half to no star but that was not possible.

The concept is there... the gameplay, controls etc. is not. Even the storyline is a bit lack luster.  I have worked for gaming companies and know what goes into making a single game... A LOT from start to finish.

Perhaps Atari needs to revamp their development teams or pack it up, go out of biz and take a vacation...

31,"I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but at first i thought this game was fun.

with multiplayer simply mashing buttons faster, rather that any form of actual technique, will always guarantee a win.

The other issue is simply that there is no AI. At the beginning of the single player arcade style games, the computer opponents just sit there until you knock them out which is about as exciting as staring at the wall. After beating a few dozen rounds the computer opponent improves a little, but then immediately after a few improved rounds, the computer opponents suddenly can move faster than you or anyone else can ever mash a button.

You can actually watch legs, weapons, and entire bodies of your player model passing through the computer opponents as you strike(no damage is caused of course, the same is not true of the computer opponent passing through the players character), the computer opponent can block at all times even while striking (the player can only strike or block, not both and there is a transition time between them), and the computer opponent can charge up all weapons in roughly one half the time the player can, and surprise! the computer opponent does between 10x-20x the damage the player can even with the computer doing the lamest misfiring hits. It appears they favored static scripts with very simply conditions to make the computer opponent succeed or fail, including outright cheating. Sad. So unless you're playing other people you're wasting your time and money.

Oh and i forgot to mention, the single player 'weaponmaster' mode (called so because it's certainly not story mode) is so boring and contrived that i honestly can not believe it's there. Par for the course...

42,"I've made the plunge for this because I'm a big Ridge Racer fan, so to make the most of my money I want to make this as detailed and well-informed a review I possibly can. For those of you like me who love Ridge Racer, you'll probably pick this up anyways so get the download version now while the DLC is still free (which stops on April 30th).

This game is a terrible value, even with the DLC. I literally don't understand how they came to this. As you can probably tell by now, the game comes with 3 tracks, 5 cars. If you got the first run physical copies or the digital copy, you get a few free DLCs, which bumps it up by another promised 5 cars and 3 courses. Notice I said promised, at the time of this writing only 3 cars and 2 courses are available. In comparison, Ridge Racer Portable had 12 courses and Ridge Racer 3D had 15 courses.

What immediately comes to mind is ""Well the content must really be fantastic then huh?"" The cars look fantastic, with gorgeous textures and detail that truly show off the Vita's capabilities. However, the courses are another matter. Not only are most (if not all) of these courses ripped straight from Ridge Racer 7, they look terrible. Textures are embarrassingly blurry, environments has low polygon counts, and the reflections have a odd glowly appearance that look completely unrealistic. Make no mistake, the courses are basically PSP graphics with anti-aliasing. If you were hoping for a Ridge Racer that at least had beautiful graphics, this is NOT it. Furthermore, none of the courses are particularly memorable, with one (Sunset Heights) actually being really badly designed. Keep in mind that I played this AFTER the patch, which claimed to have improved graphics.

Fans of Reiko Nagase should know that she does not even get her own FMV in this game like in the previous Ridge Racers, though I guess you do get to see her in the background of the menu, not really doing anything. This was particularly disappointing to me given how amazingly well done the Ridge Racer Portable FMV was.

Some of the few positive aspects of this game involves the robust online play. Online you join one of four racing teams and earn points to contribute to the teams score. The game doesn't do very much to make you feel ultimately attached to your team, but the point chasing is a nice element that gives incentive to online competition.

This is juxtaposed however by the complete lack of a single-player campaign. That's right, with the game only having 3 courses, the wonderfully well-paced racing tours from Ridge Racer Portable are nowhere to be seen, leaving only two single-player modes: Spot Race and Time Attack. These are your typical race against 7 opponents and race against time modes. Fortunately the Vita has trophy support, which can kinda serve as a incentive to gain points. However, for Spot Race, there are no difficulty settings. The racers are stuck to a single difficulty, which means casual racers will be overwhelmed and advanced racers won't feel challenged.

Ridge Racer could have been an amazing showcase for the Vita. Honestly, I would have been happy with just a HD version of Ridge Racers 2 (which sadly never made it to the States). Instead of what we have here is a game that excels at nothing, not the graphics, not the content.

Sadly, the B button on this device - BRAND NEW mind you, is terribly unresponsive and requires really forcing your thumb into what feels like placing a puzzle for the dang button to register. Worse, once you've pressed and are holding down B, the controller doesn't register you holding it down, as it slips around and requires crushing power (following a response delay that cannot be overcome by strength) just to execute any moves than require, uh... B.  I paid as much as a new controller for this, and perhaps note no other issues with any of the buttons - will possibly reconfigure the keys around as in smash having both x and y and the analog pad up serve as a jumping action is a little overkill. Either way, starting from zero this is a letdown of a purchase and my gut tells me no matter how I try to work around it's design flaws this controller won't last very long given poor functionality mint out of the box.",negative

52,"It's the same thing as Modern Warfare 2.

The weapons are basically the same, you call down air strikes, you run through a Russian prison shooting guards, you jump around from country to country shooting Communists, it's the US vs. the USSR only back in the days of the Cold War.  The story is lame as hell, it's all about trying to get Mason to remember something about a sequence of ""numbers.""  Which I am so sick of as a plot device after seeing Lost for the past 6 years.

The game itself is constantly freezing, crashing and is full of bugs.  Not to mention having constant flashbacks in different color filters, slightly out of focus, with the camera tilted slightly to the side gets old really fast, like after 5 minutes of this I was so bored and was actually talking out loud to my computer asking it, ""So when can I shoot more stuff?""  What's even worse is that the option to skip these cinematics only works when it wants to.  So 90% of the time you have to watch these lame pointless cut scenes that add NOTHING to the story other than where your next mission is and what Communist you're going after next.  You'll find yourself hitting every button on your keyboard and clicking wildly in the vane hope that you'll be taken to the start of the mission.

Also there are some pretty lame achievements, but there is no place in the game itself to look at a list of these achievements or descriptions of them in order to find out what you have to do to get them.  You have look on Steam to find that info.  And forget about Alt+Tabbing out of the game to check what achievements you can still get and then returning to the game cuz the game will crash as soon as you do that.

This game shouldn't have been a stand alone game for 60 bucks.  If anything it should have been a $20 expansion pack for MW2.  Not to mention it really sucks that you HAVE to use Steam in order to play this game.  And to top it all off, I finished the game in only 6 hours!!!  That's it!  6 HOURS for 60 BUCKS!!!",neutral

54,"one major flaw ruins this entire game...

yes you guessed it, persistent internet connection is required. If you are not connected to Battle.net servers at all times the game WILL NOT function...period! so if you disconnect mid boss fight or right before you reach a checkpoint, yep you guessed it, all your progress will be lost and you will have to start from your previous checkpoint. No, there is no SAVE GAME function in Diablo 3, the servers auto save for you at each checkpoint only.

Personally, the game content itself could be phenominal and I really wouldn't care, the explicit decision to make a  ""single player game"" a INTERNET ONLY game is absolutely convolted idiocy. Unless Blizzard makes HUGE changes to this game I would be seriously surprised if this game continues to sell its copies.

To be clear, I did not by this game. I was one of the many who received a free copy for commiting to WOW for a year. Having said that, I would not buy this game nor recommend it to anyone. I would recommend it to someone I disliked to have sweet revenge but that is it.",neutral

Then if you actually want to play the game you have to log in through the steam server to play it.

On what I got those words, 'Limited Edition', are in brighter lettering and almost the same size as 'Medal Of' and it's right below 'HONOR'. Now I can see that in the picture there is something there but it could just be the shadow parts of the picture it self. It's just a way to get you hooked to play online only. Also they push Battlefield 3 which is not what I wanted, never did like those games too over view out of touch and bad graphics.

You can spend all day going through their agreements but nowhere does it say that the game is a rental and all your rights are null and void even if you have the game CD (not burned or duplicated), game case, game manual, sales insert, jewel case cover and invoice for sale.

Extreme disappointment since the first three installments were outstanding and now I have to deal with a game I purchased that won't play.

69,"Fanboys out there are likely to send their wrath, so let me preface this review by making it clear that I wanted to enjoy this game. I loved the demo and was looking forward to playing the full game. I just today rented it and started playing it and was truly enjoying the game.

This game could've been great. It should've been great. It had so much potential. And it is different. It truly is unlike most games that come out. It has the player utilize the environment to escape the ever vigilant waves of police, both on foot and in the air via helicopter. The emphasis is on exploration and evasion.

Unfortunately this is one reason why combat is so short-changed. On the times when the only options are to fight or die (and there are plenty of them) the combat is extremely difficult. Many fights can be avoided but for some the only way to avoid being ventilated is to take down the enemy.

And as I write this I do so after attempting to escape the mall. There is a section which no matter what I do, I die. If I fight the SWAT, I die. If I try to wall run to the pipe I am supposed to swing from then leap to the catwalk above and then the next section, somewhere in there I die. Either I miss because there is so much gunfire and small, minute changes in direction that are crucial to making the jump successfully are impossible to make (you'll get shot since Faith, the lead character, can't seem to shimmy over on the pipe any faster) If I actually do make the jump and land, it doesn't matter because I become a lead sponge.

Another large problem that bogs this game down is the simple fact that the shooting never seems to stop. There are far too few respites and these all stop far too quickly, forcing the gameplay to be relegated to repetitive and annoying. I was hoping to be able to explore and look at the city in all of its beauty. Unfortunately the constant gunfire makes this goal impossible.

Speaking of repetitive, the game would've been far better if it wasn't so linear. The devs hint at looking for alternative paths. Don't bother looking for them. They don't exist. The game has one way it wants you to complete an area and it will beat you over the head until you figure out what that one way is. Until then you will see ""Loading"" many, many times.

And it's a real shame too because some of the most exhilarating gaming moments that a player may see can be found in this game. Without giving anything away, the subway has one such moment, as does a construction level. There's a really good chase scene fairly early in the game too. Immersion is handled extremely well. For years gamers could never see their hands or feet. In this game they can and the camera never pans out. Ever. If you make a roll, the camera will do a very fast 360, just like in real life. As you run you see your hands moving back and forth quickly and they change position as you gain momentum, and Faith's breathing gets heavier as she runs faster and for longer periods of time.

Dice, in the slight chance someone from your company reads this, in the future, don't just test your game for bugs and glitches. Test the game to ensure that it will be fun. Don't give us a great concept and bog it down with terrible, frustrating gameplay. I do understand that you're owned by EA Games, the Walmart of the video game industry but I am sure that even they are willing to give you a little more time to work on the game and ensure that gamers will thoroughly enjoy what you have to offer.

In all honesty Dice, I truly do want to see a sequel to this game. I do want to see this franchise succeed. I want to see you take video gaming in a new direction and I believe that this game is that first step, so I am saying all of this in the hopes that when you take that next step, it will be a good one. I really did not want to write this. I did not start playing Mirrors Edge hoping to find things to criticize. I really wanted to enjoy this game and I am truly saddened that I simply cannot do so. Please make another game that is like this one, only without the needless frustrations. If you do that, and you can find ways to improve on what you did right, and you did do a lot right, then perhaps my future reviews of your games will look more like the other two that are here on Amazon as of the time of this writing.",positive

I'm more of an action person, not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person.  Sure,  Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year.  I  turned out to be one of the latter people.  No matter how hard I tried, I  could never get the income to come out positive.  So, I did what any  distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes!  An hour  later, I was bored.  If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000  out.  But, if you're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words,  try Dungeon Keeper 2, a game like Simcity 3000, but not as complex (and  more active!).",negative
74,"Look folks, I've been playing video games for over well over 20 years.  So it doesn't take long for me to pick apart a game's strengths and weaknesses.  This game took about 2 minutes.

Quick - check yourself - how many hands do you have?  Two?  Okay - then forget playing this game.

This game tries to use the face buttons, shoulder buttons, AND the touch screen all at once.  The D-pad and YXAB buttons do the same thing - left and right positions strafe, and top/bottom positions walk forwards or backwards.  The shoulder buttons shoot.  The touch screen - used with the stylus of course - controls rotation and angle.  Now, if you're right handed, this might feel a bit more natural - like using a mouse in an FPS game on a PC.  Meanwhile your left hand - while holding the DS of course - is used to move/strafe/shoot.  I'm left-handed, however, and this control scheme is unbearably awkward.  In addition, you use the touchscreen to reload, change weapons (which requires a touch-drag-release maneuver instead of a simple button click) AND to ""look down the sight"" of your weapon.  What THIS means is that in the heat of combat, you'll be removing your eyes from the top screen - which shows the action - to find your buttons on the bottom screen.  The ONLY good feature is that when using the stylus to aim/turn/angle, it ignores the other buttons, allowing you the full width of the screen to control your character.

The graphics - like pretty much any other DS game - are terrible.  Any NPC further away from you than (roughly) 15 yards is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding scenery.  The only thing that helps you know you're pointing at someone is your aiming sights changing color.  Prefer to pick off targets from a distance?  Forget it.

This game is unplayable.  In fact, I've spent more time writing this review than I have playing the game - it's really that bad.  Sometimes you just have to accept that some games don't work on a handheld console.  Wonder why WoW isn't on DS?  Maybe for the same reasons that Call of duty SHOULDN'T be...

75,"Back in the days, that was 2007, the first Modern Warfare made me a huge fan of the series. Seven years later today, Advanced Warfare lost me. Putting all the bugs aside, the storyline is bland and the gameplay and style of attractions are getting very old. The whole game felt like a bad 2008 console port with bugs that make me want to laugh. Perhaps Activision needs to rethink Square Enixs involvement or the reason to move Advanced Warfare away from Infinity Ward? I feel like I played a hodgepodge of outdated first-person shooters. The graphic is nothing impressive even on a slightly high end PC, playing pretty much maxed out with 8x supersampling anti-aliasing and a 39 2K display on two 970s in SLI. Just like the story, the graphic detail, realism and fidelity feels outdated and reused. I feel robbed of sixty dollars along with my time spent playing this worthless title.",negative
76,"I bought this game off the PSN store so I could level up before I get a PS4 (taking advantage of the $10 upgrade deal), and yes, it is exactly like playing a Beta version of a real game.

Which just means they are, as usual, s****ing on their customers.  BEWARE you are buying a $60 Beta-version game here, if you do decide to buy it.

I haven't experienced problems like this since original launch Xbox games - seriously. When the game does work, it's not too awful...but the fact remains - this is 2013, gaming has been around for years - and a game should not be broken like this.

There were times where the ground dropped out from under me - remember those days - and I was looking up at the buildings surrounding me, stuck in a broken graphics pool - Xbox restart...inexcusable.

There were places I was allowed to go into, that I couldn't get out of - Xbox restart...

There were times where a collectable was picked up, and it didn't disappear...AND it didn't show up as me collecting it...incexcuseable.

There were times in which the game just froze - again, are you kidding me? (I'd say inexcusable, but I don't want to get too redundant.)

I enjoyed the previous BF games, so I assumed this would be just as good - boy was I wrong...and on top of them stealing my $60...they stole another $50, for premium...fool me once, fool me twice - it's the last dollars Dice or EA will ever get from me...

And as if single play wasn't bad enough, online wasn't any better - last weekend 'could not connect to servers' was the norm.

81,"I believe this game needs some tlc atm. Personally loved BF 4 (have it on 3 systems with all season passes lol). I enjoyed Battlefront, but it felt lacking. This is worse. It's becoming far too much on the ""run and gun"" idea, which is made far worse by the lmg gods that very accurately hip fire from standing positions. They did good with some weapons, but others are ridiculous and have 0 realism. Yes, it's a game and not real, but a lmg should not have hardly any accuracy from a standing position, nevermind just a constant barrage that maintains that accuracy. Moving on. You will die at times from grenades. Sometimes 1 shot at 100% health, and sometimes it just barely does anything. There needs to be some kind of balancing there, especially on various modes, like hardcore and normal, but I've survived direct grenades on hardcore and been one shotted on normal. I love hardcore in BF 4, since it tends to be less forgiving. This games version is broken. Same elements discussed previously carry to all modes.

90,"Incredible graphics. Brilliant writing. A sci-fi epic to put Star Wars to shame. Intelligent enemies that use the environment against you. Without a doubt, it's the best shooter I've ever played. Now, enough about Halo. Lets talk Aliens. (There are some spoilers in the review, but considering how bad the game is, it doesn't really matter)

Aliens-Colonial Marines is not the game I was expecting. The graphics were disappointingly bad. The story was a grade-A mess. The game was glichier than Fallout 3. Colonial Marines opens with a cutscene that seems to mimic Aliens to the point of deja vu. After a quick update by your commanding officer as to how bad the situation is, you're thrown headfirst into the Sulaco (from Aliens, in case the billions of commercials didn't get the whole Aliens thing through) Aided by foulmouthed O'Neal, you rescue an infected marine named Keyes from the clutches of some... brown goo. Yes, folks, the Xenomorph creep looks like snot. The first level also introduces you to several recurring themes in the game- fleeting moments of greatness squashed by technical incompetence, cheesy Marine dialogue, bad voice acting, and dialogue seemingly spat out by a random word generator.

Ah, the sounds of pure terror- Alien hisses, clanking in the distance, the ""click"" that tells you your pulse rifle is empty. You won't find any of that here. Instead, Gearbox has, as is the custom with rush job games like this, several tinny soundbites that vaguely resemble the sounds of Aliens in the same way the demos resemble the actual product- no, if any, similarities at all. Bob the Sound Hamster must have been busy the night before this turkey shipped, because it takes a special kind of stupid to make a game sound this bad. By the end of the first level, the grating pulse rifle noise will be stuck in your head. Sadly, there are still more headaches to come.

By far, the most evident shortcoming was the lobotomized behavior of the aliens. The movies portrayed the vicious alien xenomorphs as cunning hunters, stalking and outsmarting their reckless human prey. These ugly 3-D models that dare call themselves aliens are nothing like that. Their strategies include...running mindlessly at the player with no self-preservation instinct...""moonwalking"" straight in to corners...or just ignoring your attempts at using your pulse rifle to turn them into extraterrestrial mush. The human enemies, Weyland-Yutani mercenaries, are just as brain-dead. When you go up against a mob of these grunts, get ready to crouch. With your character having such low health, you have to take cover behind... those awkward-looking computer things. Yes, in Aliens- Colonial Marines, there is much squatting and dying witout reason.  There's no strategy, no tension, no point.

But wait- it gets worse! On the technical side, the game seems to be built on an older version of the venerable Unreal 3 engine. For the same engine that is used in games like Gears of War, the ""updates"" Gearbox/TimeGate/Nerve/whoever made this game added to the engine must have included downgrading it to Wii levels. To be even more technical, the graphics could be from a Nintendo 64 game- from 1996. Fuzzy, blurry textures, lazy lighting, stiff characters don't help a game that already screams ""failure"" from the poorly rendered opening cutscene to the abrupt credit roll. The art design and architecture from Aliens is butchered by making it as blocky as a Mario game.

Then you have the ""story"". I say ""story"" because it fits the minimum story requirements, such as having characters and settings. Not that any of those settings or the characters in them will interest you in any way. I actually had a hard time keeping up with the story and characters because the whole thing must have gone through the proverbial blender. The plot of Aliens- Colonial Marines can be summed up in a few words- blah, blah, blah, aliens, blah, blah, blah, facehugger, blah, blah, blah, hold on a minute, you're going too fast!

And...HICKS IS ALIVE!!!!! HOW!!! WHY!!!!! It doesn't matter. To Gearbox and SEGA, it just matters you give them your money for an unfinished and incomplete game. Don't give in. As fondly as I feel about the Alien movies, this is a disgrace. To get this most out this game, just buy it used and get a season pass for the DLC. At least that, along with the patch, fixes the most glaring bugs. The game still sucks. Even patches can't fix stupid.",negative

95,"This ""game"" will have a distinguished place in history for me as being 1 of the only 2 games I have ever put into a console and simply could not play it, the other being Game Party: In Motion (a Kinect game in which we couldn't get past the main menu). I would also compare it to Sims3 -- a game I suggest EA rename ""LOADING"" because that's most of what the game did (on the console version). I never played the most recent SimCity offering which earned EA the trophy for the most hated company in America. I'm sure I'd liken Defiance to that, if I'd played it.

So anyway, we are stuck in some kind of bad patch/install loop or something. I realize I got this thing in the bargain bin for $7.99 or whatever-it-was and that the TV show looks like really bad cheesy sci-fi (of Babylon 5 ilk) -- I say this as a sci-fi fan...but I can't fathom why after a year, the patch process hasn't been figured out, bad patches removed, or whatever is necessary to play this piece of garbage. The game is currently telling me (after what seemed like 10 patches, 2 or 3 hours later) that an install of 3716 MB is required to play. It already said that 2 hours ago and I have far more than that left on the hard drive. There's another 1 star review on here that also talked about the patch process but couldn't answer how to actually install the patches properly to play the stupid thing (apparently its luck of the draw). Should I really have to scour the internet to figure out how to play a console game? This is what PC gamers generally have to put up with and console gamers do not...

I do hold the game in very high regard for giving me some big lulz, including one part of the patch/install process in which the game said 480-something days left on its install time. Upon seeing that I started laughing hysterically and yelling to my girlfriend ""quick, get the camera and take a picture of that!!"" By the time she got the camera, the game was down to a modest 475 days left to install!!! HOORAY!!!! I joked that I would leave the game to my next of kin, and hopefully they or their children's children would be able to play it someday...heh.

Also, the patch process apparently takes so long that the Xbox controller falls asleep and that pauses the download of the patch for some bizarre reason (why does the controller have to even be on for this? - who knows)...You might have to rubber band the thumbsticks to keep it awake. They should release an additional patch to the game to keep it awake so you can go watch a movie or something while it pointlessly does what ever it is doing, ad infinitum, ad nauseum, while running your controller battery down to oblivion...

Maybe the Trion servers are disconnected and I'm unaware and they didn't patch it with a patch superseding other patches to tell people. That'd be a laugh riot...

Well anyway...I'm going to fiddle with this idiotic pile of garbage and I'm sure just uninstall the whole thing and perhaps dump the game into the trash can...

98,"I got the demo of this game on PSN and I loved it. I'm a PC gamer so I decided to download it from Steam, then Amazon. I bought the game from both Steam and Amazon, and both times I was met with the same issue, even after multiple reinstalls and downloads: it doesn't render anything! This game is supposed to be an over-the-shoulder third person adventure game, but the only time you can see your character is the brief second when you're drawing your gun. The world around you doesn't spawn half the time, and the other half only spawns when you're very close or looking from a specific angle. The help I got form Ubisoft was useless. I told them my predicament, and they told me to upgrade my graphics card. I can run AC III, GTA, Halo 1 and 2, Fallout 3, and Skyrim on my laptop, so I know my graphics card is fine. If you're looking for a way to waste a few hours playing games, don't buy this. If you're looking to waste your money on a game that is unplayable, you found your game right here.",positive

Wake up UBI, look at all of your other software title reviews, both here on Amazon and on gaming sites. People are not as stupid as you think, and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software.

In case you weren't paying attention, this latest edition of Sony's PSP battery charger comes with a cord that must be used in order to operate and charge batteries.

The whole point of the PSP 1000 battery charger was its compact design that included the outlet prongs attaching directly to the unit itself.  It was a perfect travel companion but now...just a hassle.

It is actually much simpler to charge a PSP through the supplied AC adapter included with the PSP itself than it is to use this thing.

106,"Pac-Man has been having a really good run on the Nintendo Gamecube, really. With titles like the excellent 3D platforming adventure Pac-Man World 2 and the fun multiplayer experience that is Pac-Man Vs. under the dot-muncher's sleeves, not to mention a Namco Museum containing Arrangement games.

So why the heck did Namco allow this to be placed onto store shelves? Trust me when I say that the opening FMV video to the game was the best thing about it. Once you get that out of the way, you're thrown into a swarm of low-budget-ness, complete with Comic Sans font seen in menus and other bland screens. This includes the game itself, which is just a board game video game as a way to hop aboard the Mario Party train. Only problem: This is way worse than every Mario Party there is.

The game lets you pick one of THREE boards. Yes. Only three. Even worse, they are boards that you just race from start to finish on. I thought it'd be alright though, since a brief game could still be fun. However, they managed to make these boards DRAG. I could have sworn I was supposed to finish up my game like an hour or so prior. Instead, this is as slow as a snail's pace.
There are no dice blocks. Instead, the minigames actually start at the beginning of every turn. How far you move depends on how well you ranked in the minigame. Unfortunately, the minigames suffer from feeling like being made under a low budget, and were nowhere as fun as Mario Party minigames. Everything felt so static and soulless, especially in minigames where you drive a kart or throw darts/""discs"".

As a player walks across the board's spaces, there's no telling what BS could happen. There are Spring spaces (bounce player forward), Return spaces (opposite), spaces where a bunch of a player's coins could be taken away or earned easily. and Store spaces where players could spend on cheapness such as moving forward or SENDING OTHER PLAYERS BACK SPACES. Yeah, that's pretty fair, am I right?

With all that said, my first and so far only playthrough on one of the boards was dreadful. There were so many times where I couldn't land on a Store space, and I haven't even landed on a Spring space, yet the CPUs had several times. The fact that I won was nothing short of a miracle

I would have given this 2 stars, but the thing is - I never had fun with it. Even with crap games like Sonic 2006 or Rock & Roll Adventures, I've found a way to get at least a little bit of enjoyment out of them. But with this? I was rather stressed out by how luck-based many moves felt.",positive

118,"This game's a pile garbage!  The developers claimed that they wanted to create a game that lived up to the true innovation of real-life backyard wrestling.  Well if this game's any indication of what backyard wrestling's really like, forget it.  I rented this game the other day from my local video store.  After playing about 5 minutes horrendous gameplay, I soon felt that I was ripped off out of the money I paid to rent this garbage (thank goodness for rentals).  Here are some major downfalls of BW:
The character models are poor.
When characters talk, the mouths don't even move.
Computer AI is extremely cheap.
Computer has almost 99% perfect accuracy when picking up & throwing weapons from a distance at you, they almost never miss.
Create-Character-Mode is cheap beyond cheapness.
Replay value isn't great (after unlocking all the characters after one sitting, what's the point?).
Especially creating characters.  The worst part of the game.  Fans of WWE Create-a-character modes will be woefully disappointed.  The player can't even create a character from scratch, all they can do is select a pre-made character and mobilize their stats and fighting style.  You can't even develope the character's costume.  All you do is choose a costume that has already been made (imagine playing a fighting game as your favorite character and choosing a different costume for them to fight in, that's technically all you can do).  There aren't even many move to choose from for your character.  Yes the game does have it's strong points such as taking full advantage of the X-box's custom soundtracks system, and there are some nice videos to watch in the media room (some of which have to be unlocked).  However, is it really worth playing through, just for videos?  What's worst is that the game doesn't even play like a wrestling game.  It plays more so of that as a button-mashing fightng game.  Take it from me, there are plenty of better wrestling games out there (I really feel for those who poured out their fifty bucks of hard earned cash on this title).  And to those considering buying BW, avoid this title at all costs.  Even WWF RAW is better!",positive

I take a shot, then you take a shot then he does, etc.  Utterly lame.  The adventure is completely linear.  It gives you no choices and leads you by the nose.  Often you don't even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well.  When you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you.

Pros: It's cheap and functions as intended for non-gamers or people using it for the extra programmable buttons.
Cons: The side buttons are cheap, the mechanism on the inside breaks with little to no pressure, there is nothing inside the mouse to keep the button structures intact. Not really intended for serious gaming. Also finding software to actually program the existing buttons requires downloading malware or viruses, since they do not have any legitimate software for the mouse itself. Also the it's hit or miss if the mouse actually changes colors as intended.

Short Version:
If you have ever played any other football game on any other platform this one will probably disappoint.
This is the worst football game ever (on any platform, going back to 1981)
This is the worst XBOX game that I've seen.
Graphics = D
worst of any XBOX football game, even last years madden for the PC was much better.  Truely disappointing.  For example the goal posts don't look like poles, but a stack of poorly aligned Lego blocks (very bad jaggies)
Sound = C+
so-so.  Nothing special, nothing horrible.  Very few choices and very redundent after 5 mins.
Features = F
Missing even simple things.  You can not review your roster, or set your starters.  There is no coach-mode, only arcade play.  Doesn't even pretend to be a sim.
Supposedly you can import players from this game into Madden 2003, but what would be the point when the players in this game do not have any names?  And don't seem to be based on actual players?
Gameplay = F
VERY VERY VERY BAD.  Play last years NFL Fever 2002 for an example of how an arcade football game should play, or last years Madden 2002 for the PC for an example of how a strategy football game should play (or if you want, try an oldie called Front Page Sports FootBall Pro for even a better example of a strategy football sim).",negative

You may have heard legends of terrible games, depending on how much of the internet you are exposed to. Superman 64, Bubsy 3D, Atari's E.T., and the entire Sonic Franchise. Well, even amongst the sordid mediocrity and perfidious failure that is the Sonic Team's trademark, Sonic '06 may be the coup-de-gras. The queen mother. The magnum opus. Etc.

It is an historically bad mistake to play this game.
It feels much like playing the Alpha version of a bad indie game. Y'know the ones- from the back alleys of Steam or the corners of the internet. Unfocused, with glitches sprinkled about like a seasoning of idiocy, this game leads you by a hook in your navel on a tour-de-force of history's worst missions and side-quests.

The soundtrack...exists. I need say no more. But I will. Think elevator music done by an ""up-and-coming"" garage band. In reverse.
The voice acting was done by a team of out-of-work car salespeople,who were given one take to say all of their lines in what sounds to be a cotton-ball manufacturing plant.
The vague gesticulations at a plot were written down by a man with a 109 degree fever and an addiction to hallucinogenic drugs. (He also died after the first campaign was written, it seems. There is no plot to speak of after Sonic is conquered.)

The shooting mechanic is AWFUL!! i don't know how many times i had an enemy in my cross hairs and it would then quickly skip over the target. Before you think i can't play shooters i beat all the halos alone on legendary and both gears on nightmare so i can play a shooter. this has to be one of the most skittish games i have ever played. also i don't know how many times i fell to my death because i would dive the wrong way or it would make me dive 2 times if i pressed the button only once or i would walk off of a mysterious disappearing ledge,(not part of the game) didn't do the same thing on subsequent play throughs. the graphics are ok but this game tries too hard to be gears, it rips off quite a few lines from gears as well. honestly your better off just replaying gears if you're thinking about getting this game. or if you don't own gears or gears 2 get those instead they're the same price.

178,"A red flag should go up immediately upon reading the end user license agreement that they make you accept.  To paraphrase:  We do not guarantee the ability to actually be able to play the game.  That tells you all you need to know about the online at all times requirement.

In many ways Diablo 3 reminds me of some disappointments I had with Dungeon Siege 3.  There's the system that awards a player with every skill by the time a certain level is attained.  Gone are the days where you had a stable of characters each with their own specialization.  There's the system that automatically assigns stat points, another aspect that will be the same every time you play the game.  The only way to modify stat points is via item attributes.  Levels that are tight corridors.  While still fun in their own way all of these things detracted from the replay value of Dungeon Siege 3.  It was a play it a few times game and then forget it because you already knew which skills you'd end up with and what stats you'd have before you even started your second playthrough.  The exact same ones you had the last time.  Diablo 3 suffers the same fate, it's not going to last 12 years like its predecessor because there is no depth in character uniqueness.

The game is also shorter.  Sure, you can play it over again at a higher difficulty but it's still disappointing to have to play the exact same levels three times over to arrive at a decent target time for what should have been the time it takes to play through the game once.

With the online requirement that perpetually threatens playing time (and restricts play on my terms) and a severely shortened replay value I found it difficult to justify the initial price tag.  For what it is this game should have been much, much cheaper at launch.  I would say wait for a price drop but this is Blizzard.  You'll be waiting a long time for that.

182,"Like many other gamers, I eagerly awaited the release of this title, for quite some time.  Also like other reviewers, I am saddened by the final product.  Here is why.

1. The biggest reason I am so disappointed in D3 is the Real Money Auction House (RMAH).  I knew it was going to be in the game, but the thought didn't bother me.  I've never planned to purchase items or gold with real money.  The major problem is that Blizzard has seen fit to design the game so that you will NEED to purchase items and gold from the AH in order to progress without some maddening gear grind that would take a lifetime. In short, they have set the game up to require use of the AH, in order to profit from the resultant transaction fees.

2. Absolutely terrible online service. This game is required to be connected to the internet at all times while playing, but the company has provided sub-standard service that results in frequent disconnects, server downtime, and constant gameplay lag.

For those of you that are familiar with Blizzard games, you know that their past titles have been superb award-winning masterpieces. This is NOT one of them.  As a matter of fact, this game feels very little like a Blizzard game.  I'm completely shocked that they have released something as bad as this.",negative

189,"there is one thing it must have in 2005 if I'm going to buy it.
In Dynasty mode, when you create your schedule at the beginning of the year, you must play X number of games in your conference, and you can't change them. In 2003, Michigan did not play Penn State or Wisconsin. So, even if I play 20 years of Dystany football with Michigan, I can NEVER play against PSU or WI.
I would also like to see being able to switch players' positions. If I have 8 guards rated at 99, and 2 centers at 50, I can't cut the centers and have one of the guards move over.
And it would be cool to see Michigan run out of the tunnel, hitting the GO BLUE banner on the way out.

195,"Interesting game at certain levels.  At low levels this game can be very fun.  lots of people and easier leveling make it very entertaining.  And then it stops... there is a pretty large gap in people and grouping from the low levels about 30ish until your level 70.  The game has become a solo grind until you get 70 because a majority of the game content is written for level 70 or is so outdated that its not useful or even possible to get people to explore the content on most occasions.  Once a character reaches level 70 it is pretty much a requirement for a person to devote themselves to either pvp which then is mostly a solo act again unless you happen to find an active pvp guild which can be very challenging and on a whole is a very limited experience. pvp requires that you grind for the gear that make a character able to compete with other characters.  very little of the pvp system relies on a players skill.  The other major option is to engage in PVE which the player can experiance a wide range of content.  this can be a very interesting way to explore wow though once again very quickly it becomes a limited venue do to the social demands of guilding and gear that are required to continue to explore the content.  Months can be spent to gain a new item that is only marginally better than a previous one and one that could be replaced in days if a player was willing to devote their free time and suffer the whims of a higher ranked guild.

All for all.. if your a new player expect at least a couple of months of solo grinding to get your character to a point that you will be even socially eligible to be able to enjoy the majority of the content of the game.  If your willing to do that the game can be very fun.",neutral
196,"I just finished this game a moment ago, and boy, all I can say is booooooooring. What was with that ending? Hyrule Castle and final fight. Too short and rushed. Like the latter half of the game as a whole.
The ending of Wind Waker was LEGENDARY! I yawned once I finished Twilight Princess.

Listen, this game had a wonderfull beginning. I liked the cutscenes and the first time I transformed into a wolf I was in awe. But then I hated how weak and rushed the plot became. Why the hell did those orcs just drop the kids somewhere? And around the time Ilia got her memory back the plot fizzled completely. Also the plot in this game was too little about Triforce, history, the world/land of Hyrule etc. They were touched really superficially.
The plot and dialogue were *extremely inferior* compared to Wind Waker.
Twilight Princess was boring, choppy and jumpy after a great beginning.

And the dungeons. Something was severely lacking. In the beginning they were ok, though nothing great, but then they got horrible. Like the City in the Sky and Twilight Realm. Horrible.
I guess they went for quantity not quality. The dungeons were boring and repetitive, the puzzles old and they lacked any atmosphere.
Also if I remember correctly in Wind Waker you had to use many of the items you had acquired in different places. Not here.

This game was also *WAY too easy*. I'm not a good player, honestly, but I never once died during the game. As a matter of fact I was near perfect health nearly all the time. Once you got the Master Sword you just needed to swing the nunchuk and the enemies would vanish. I mean I'd want standard enemies that would be at least as tough as Ganon was in the final swordfight.
The bosses were also very easy and somehow lamer than in Wind Waker.

I liked the Wii controls and they were well planned and easy to use. But I have one complaint. Circling behind an enemy's back really didn't work that well. First you had to sidestep and then roll. But guess what, most of the time the roll (+sidestep) brought you around the enemy to where you started. It was irritating (though not by any means impossible) to hit the enemies in the back.

Oh, and why did most of the characters have to look so retarded? They showed with some models that they could make neat looking ones as well...

Riding on the horse was the greatest part of this game!
You should really buy Wind Waker instead of this. People complain about the graphics but they're quite nice once you get used to them. And did I mention that the dialogue and plot are awesome. The Triforce Hunt is the only annoying and tedious part of that game. TP felt the same all the time after the beginning. Just scores of poorly designed dungeons and a choppy and weak plot.",neutral

First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions.  Only in game play was I able to move my character.  Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt.  If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo.  That was just a waste of space.  I also felt limited by the small selection of tools.  Not even the cheat codes would entirely work.  For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips.  The guns themselves were not even very good.  The sniper rifle didn't ""snipe."" The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak.

209,"I've been playing WoW since beta phase 2, so well over 6 years. I have the panda collector original edition pet, and every collector pet since then. I have 5 level 80 characters of which one is a day from 85 and the others are all ranged dps so they will take about a week each to get to 85, since they all started in t10+ gear. So I have experienced every little bit of WoW short of the level 85 experience.

Whats wrong with Cataclysm ? Well, if you aren't a Goblin newbie, everything. The content is moderately interesting, but the quest engine is badly broken. Let me say from the outset that quite a few have completed all the quests in Vash, Deep, and Hyjal. But a huge number of players got halfway through the quest chain in both Vash and Deep and then could no longer find NPCs giving quests. The GMs say it is a known bug and is being worked on, but this means the only way to level pretty much is random dungeons. And these days, with so many in the same fix, the wait queue for a random dungeon team can run well over 10 minutes. For a healer!

And since questing has ALWAYS been the premier attraction of WoW expansions (only way you can experience the unveiling of the Lore) it is quite clear Blizzard really let us all down on this. Frankly, if you are just starting, just buy the base game, or even Wrath of the Liche King, which plays great up to level 80, and the quest chain works all the way to 80 and beyond.

214,"It is the most underdeveloped part of FIFA in god knows how many instalments in the EA series. The audio commentary.

Current generation CPU's can process 7 billion computations per second.

My goal keeper just threw the ball short to the opposition and they almost scored. This was almost disastrous. Everyone would be furious, ""what is he doing!!??!"", but instead Martin Tyler is telling me that my goal keeper has just made a stunning save. He is a hero.

Simlarly, a stunning through ball, Messi is one on one with the goal keeper. I take a shot, bahhh it goes wide. Messi just missed a sitter. But Martin Tyler is so impressed with him. ""what a great shot! well done messi"".

A couple of minutes later, the box is heavily defended, I can barely see a patch of green grass. I manage to create something out of nothing. A half chance at goals at best. Understandably it goes wide. Fair effort. My striker did well to even make something of it. But Martin Tyler doesnt see it that way. ""He just squandered an amazing chance"" he claims.

These mistakes in audio commentary are due to the archaic algorithms that still exist in the 20th instalment of the FIFA franchise.

The archaic set of commands that determine what Martin Tyler says.

""IF 'player does this' & 'ball does 'this' THEN commentator says ......""

No other variables? You cant spice things up a bit in the 21st century of computer coding?

I could have written this set of codes on my 86' ATARI.

It doesnt factor into the equation where the ball is, what happened a few moments ago, who is around during the sequence? In fact this data is already there for them to use. (You can get this information during half time with detailed map analysis of what was played and where). Just put this data into the audio algorithm for heavens sake!

It would take EA sports a fraction of effort to add and tweak these few extra variables into the equation. A little bit more data entry, a little more man hours, and a few more bits of command. You could drastically improve the commentary of FIFA 14.

If player was outside the box & there was 4 defenders in front of him & player does this & if ball trajectory does this, then commenator says this....

= ""wow shot goes wide but messi did so well to make something of that. He had no space. Great shot outside the box""

You get the picture

= ""Oh dear he was one on one with the keeper there""
= ""Wow what a cool and calm finish, he still had alot to do""
= ""Oh my goodness Zlatan! My word. A rocket from outside the box""
= ""Oh he squandered the chance, he had Xavi completely free on the right""
= ""Ronaldo! wow he just passed all the defenders""

Take into account the position of the ball, the position of players. Why cant Martin Tyler yet differentiate between a one on one and a long distance shot from outside the box.

Instead, EA sports has made the most minimal of efforts to release new titles for the PS4.

However, be advised that this game - even the boxed DVD edition - requires authentication through the Steam online system, and once that game is registered to your Steam account, it can't be ""unregistered"" or used by any other (new) Steam account.

I've been in contact with Steam's woefully inadequate tech support - only available through email - and was so advised.

When you create a Steam account (for those, like me, who are unfamiliar with it) you have to authenticate your account through an email verification process. That means that if you want to transfer the account - which would be necessary if you want to give or sell your game to someone else when you're done playing it - you'd have to be directly involved in manipulating the system to give that third party access to and control over the Steam account you created. Further, you can't delete or cancel your Steam account.

What this means, for all practical purposes, is that this game is designed to be playable only by the original purchaser.

Now, I don't know about you, but when I buy any other property - books, movies, cars, houses, whatever - when I'm done with them, I can sell or give them to someone else to enjoy. That, after all, is one of the key elements of actually ""owning"" a piece of property.

Well... not so with this game. You're paying fifty bucks to essentially RENT this game on a permanent basis.

It has an original and thoughtful story and the endless attack combos and multiple endings gives this game a very high replay value as well. I was very exited to get this for PC as mouse/keyboard is the best set up for a FPS by far. I was crushed when I found it had installed a virus that crippled my virtual drives. Removing secuROM from my system was a lengthy nightmare that involved risky registry editing that can damage your system permanently if not done exactly right.

222,"This is a fun game in many ways, but with some very frustrating drawback. EA Sports has been producing this game for 17 years now and they have received the same criticism for all those years - still they seem unable to do anything about it.

Here goes:
1. As in every other NHL-game in this series, the AI is very bad. Even if you play at the most advanced level, you will very soon dominate the game completely.
2. The goaltenders are just as pathetic as ever. To compensate for not being able to create a decent AI that could make the game challenging, EA Sports insteade made the CPU goaltender almost impossible to score against while your own goalie will drop in almost every puck.

The consequence of these two drawbacks are simple. You'll dominate each and every game completely, but you'll still loose. Be prepared for you shooting 70 shots and scoring 1 goal while the CPU will shoot 3 shots and score 2 goals. The result is that the games in NHL09 don't resemble real hockey games.

All in all, this is a fun game if you play agains friend (and these days it's the only thing I use it to do) but totally useless if you want to play against the computer as EA Sports hasn't been able to develop an AI that would produce realistic games despite 17 years of experience.

224,"Turtle Beach has usually been good with their headsets in the past, especially when it comes to console headsets. For PC, they really don't seem to care. Any pair of PC headsets I've bought from them breaks and has to be sent back at least three times before the year warranty is up. The cause of the breakings is the same as everyone else; above the earcup, or just bad quality parts in general. My brother had to send his back 5 times, and the side panel on his computer case is covered in Turtle Beach stickers that came with the headset (Turtle Beach always sent brand new headsets and never the original one). We had a contest going to see who could get the most stickers by the end of the year, and he won by 2.

My brother's never actually broke physically, but always had problems with the dongle not connecting all the way which caused cut-outs in the sound or would never stay connected, or the speakers themselves would stop working if he did a sound test. My breaks were always physical. On the bright side, we have 8 sets of splitters which are actually more useful. We also never abused the headsets in any way shape or form since they cost nearly $100 and we like taking care of our things.

It's a little sad because these headsets sounded great and would have been awesome if they could last longer than a month at a time. The amount of speakers caused them to be on the heavy side which made them hard to wear for long periods of time, but that doesn't matter because they'll slide off when the plastic gives up. After this experience I've found out it's better to go with stereo headsets and use simulated 5.1 or 7.1 sound; they're lighter and have less chances of going wrong, and it sounds just as good (this obviously depends on your intended audio use). Also, depending on the brand, they won't break before you can even consider them used. I'm never buying Turtle Beach again after this experience.",neutral
225,"I would recommend it for investing for 1 getting a piece of steam/valve physically to hold, 2 its new but as I used it, i encountered problems with the ergonomics or style of the controller, my hands hurt after a rocket league match to put it logically, and the two synaptic feedbacks are too sensitive to touch and sometimes hits buttons, the two buttons in the back are also wonky, hitting them by accident. The controller will not work on consoles especially on the ps4 where steam runs as well. the controller is big and its meant for hands bigger than me, say gabe newells. i believe this controller was made to please gabe newell himself otherwise he wouldnt have invested as much in it without going to VCs or Crowdfunding.

227,"I am 30 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Alien films, I was 16 or 17 when the first Alien vs Predator game came out and I loved it. I have always been a PC gamer and have stuck with it through the hardest of times both for me and for PC gaming itself. I enjoyed Borderlands 2, I thought it had some enjoyable coop but I quickly realized how the majority of fun came from the fact that I was playing with friends, not necessarily the game play.

This is not to say Borderlands 1 or 2 are bad games, they do what they set out to do well, and because of that I had faith that Gearbox would deliver at least a semi-decent product, but this game is one of the most shameful displays of a 2013 entertainment product that we will likely see all year. I actually went into this game expecting it to not be that great and I was still completely and utterly let down. I am also a pretty big Left 4 Dead fan and have 500 hours between both games clocked on my Steam account, Aliens Colonial Marines takes a few pages from L4D and shoves them into a lifeless, shell of a game.

There is not one single little detail that this game does better than anything else, and I say that with zero troll-ness in my heart, I say this because I really do not want people to waste their money like I did. I am a sucker. I fell for the marketing and the nostalgia brought on by my childhood. I should have realized that the embargo on reviews meant they knew it was bad, I should have listened to my gut when I first saw game play footage and the animations looked like something that came out before Doom 3. My friend and I are most of the way through the campaign right now and I had to quit because it was so mind-numbingly dull and repetitive. I will go back one last time to beat the campaign because I spent $50 on this ""game"", but I will never play it again after that, I will never pre-order another game and the chances of me buying another Gearbox title are pretty much slim to nil.

For reference my Game of The Year for 2012 was Far Cry 3.",neutral

229,"This game looks great, but plays TERRIBLE.
The first thing you should know, is that this game has a god-awful camera angle to it.  I was constantly re-centering the thing, or would be walking in one direction, only to have the camera angle change and my guy would start walking off to the side.  When fighting swarms of enemies, it's impossible to see the people hitting you from behind your character, and that's even after messing with the camera-toggle moving it as far away as possible.  It's just not smooth at all.
Second, this game is trying to be some kind of action-rpg, but you constantly collect so many pieces of armor or weapons or gems or whatever, that you find yourself going into your equipment menu ALL THE TIME to see if that thing you just picked up is a better piece of armor then the one you are wearing.
Third, the game makes no sense.  After watching the movies and whatever - I have NO idea who I am or what I'm fighting against.  I was at the point that when a nonsensical cutscene came along, I would just pick up my phone and check my email.
Fourth, there's ZERO challenge to the game.  Sure, you can level up and get better armor and weapons, but YOU DON'T DIE in the game, so what's the point?  When you die, you have to sit through this annoyingly repetitive cutscene (check phone for email again!) and just start right off near where you died.  So you find yourself just holding down the trigger or holding down the right stick to attack over and over and over again until you die.  Come back to life - repeat - hold down trigger until you die again.  It's not fun.
Fifth, the voice acting is laughable.  Many cut scenes don't quite line up and the dialog is atrocious.  Many times while playing, your ""team"" will say the DUMBEST stuff; ""Think that's the last of 'em?""  Yeah - I've killed 2000 of those enemy-robot-alien whatevers and I'm sure THAT was the last one.  ""Medic!"" - a) there's no medic and b) you never die anyway so what are you crying about?
Sixth, your team is LAME.  They do very little, get lost most of the time, and make NO sense in their existence.  Either they die off (they get reborn at random times?) or get lost or just completely disappear.  Oh but don't worry, you'll still hear their annoyingly repetitive dialog CONSTANTLY, even when they AREN'T THERE.

235,"For starters, I never really was fond of the Wii version of Pac-Man Party. I thought it was confusing, boring, and a cheap knockoff of Mario Party 8. But, my brother really enjoys the Wii version so I decided to buy Pac-Man Party 3D for him for his birthday, thinking it was a brand new game in the Pac-Man Party series.

So we wait for a week or so and the game finally comes. I give it to him, he plays it, and then shuts it off 5 minutes later. I wasn't too surprised, it was late at night when I gave it to him and I thought maybe he was just tired. But he didn't play it the next day. Or the next. To be honest, over the course of a year now, he's maybe only played Pac-Man Party 3D three times, and he's continued to play the Wii version. I was slightly taken aback. I paid a lot of money for this game and he never plays it. So I decided to investigate. I put the game in my 3DS, and that's when the truth was unveiled.

Pac-Man Party 3D is NOT a new game. It is a PORT of the Wii version. It is exactly the same game, just with the whole ""wiggle-waggle"" features removed and instead replaced with touch screen controls. I suddenly understood why my brother never played the game. I was also angered. Nowhere in the description did it say this game was a port of the Wii version.

I really am glad I wasted $30 on a port of an already mediocre game. If you liked the Wii version, and you want a portable version, by all means buy this. But if you're looking for a new Pac-Man Party game, this is not it. Save your $30.",neutral

237,"""Lost In Blue"" is one of those sub-par games that want to be so much better than they are, and the fact that they aren't is such a tragedy that you almost feel bad for the people who have to market them.  Don't get me wrong, there are fun aspects to the game; spear-fishing, for instance, is a hoot, and after spending days (in game-time) on the brink of starvation, the opportunity to finally see a full Hunger meter is truly satisfying.  I should also mention in all fairness that the game does make good, if limited, use of the DS touch screen and microphone, mostly through the aforementioned spear fishing and through fire building.  Unfortunately, these bright spots are too few and far between to add up to a game worth playing, or at least paying full-price for, and I spent much of my time feeling angry and frustrated at the game's nonintuitive and often downright illogical gameplay.  Bow-hunting, for instance, is almost impossible without the use of snare traps, and even then it's irritatingly hit-or-miss; using snare traps essentially entails watching an animal as it walks, making a guess as to where its path will take it, and placing the trap and hoping your prediction was correct.  If it was correct, great; if it wasn't, and the animal changes direction at the last second, you're screwed, because traps can't be reused once set.  You can also capture and domesticate a goat for the ostensible purpose of obtaining milk, but even though I did everything I was supposed to do (capture goat--check, bring home--check, provide partner with bottles--double check), the goat went unmilked until it finally keeled over dead in the night.  But what really killed the game, and what made me lose interest and leave it unfinished, is the fact that halfway through the game, you're required to leave your partner behind at camp and strike out on your own for a few days, making sure that she has enough food and water so that she won't die while you're gone, and the game offers absolutely no explanation for why you can't just take her with you even though she's perfectly capable of making the trip with your assistance.  Worse yet, at the cave which serves as your home-away-from-home, there are TWO ready-made (not to mention unexplained) sleeping pallets, only serving to underscore the question.  And worse even than THAT, she proves time and again to be so wildly inept at taking care of herself--flatly ignoring the barrel full of fresh water and letting herself slowly die of thirst, for instance--that you may well have to abandon your quest midway through and run home to stop her from killing herself.  (She also has an unfortunate tendency to wander away from the cave, leaving you to search for her before she dies of exposure.  You may feel tempted to just let her go and be rid of her, but the game won't let you do that; if she dies, the game ends.)  You'll most likely end up running home a few times anyway, as the game only lets you stockpile a few days' worth of provisions for her to live off of, and exploring the ruins will almost certainly take far longer than that.  I can't imagine why the game's designers would intentionally include such a flawed puzzle, but it's there, it can't be avoided, and it frustrated me to no end.

Since I've already rambled on far too long, I'll only mention in passing the game's thinly-disguised sexism in the form of a male character who does all the hunting and gathering and a female character who hardly ever leaves home, as well as the sudden jarring digression into Tomb Raider territory that comes with exploring the ruins.  Once you've beaten the game, you have the option of playing it through again from your partner's point of view, a page clearly taken from the book of Resident Evil 2 (fortunately, that's where the similarity ends!), but since I gave up on the game halfway through the first playthrough, I can't offer any opinions on that particular aspect.  Honestly, though, the fact that the first half of the game is so hard to get through with your patience intact proves--to me, anyway--that it really doesn't matter if the second half is enjoyable or not.  All in all, while ""Lost in Blue"" does offer a few innovative and fun gameplay elements, the aggregate experience was so overwhelmingly negative for me that I can only recommend this game if you're not the kind of person who is easily frustrated, and even then, you should probably look for a used copy.",negative

A racing game that has no offline multiplayer is as useless as a fighting game with no offline multiplayer. My only guess as to why EA would be stupid enough to publish this game is that they ignorantly believe that if people cannot play this game on split screen, they will convince their friends to buy a copy and play it online. Whether their reasoning was out of greed or laziness does't really matter, though-- the point is that this game is more like buying half of a game with one of the most fundamental features missing.

For some reason, the ""Steam"" portal - which is created by the same company - works fine, I could connect, download updates, all that fun stuff.

But anytime I tried connecting to a server to play Team Fortress 2 - it would never connect.

I'm not a network engineer, or a programmer - but would somebody please explain to me how the same company can create one program that is able to connect through the internet, but another program (that runs at the same time as the first) isn't able to?

To me that's just bad programming.

After spending several hours trying to get this game working, I just threw it in the trash - a waste of $14.

It will also make me think twice about purchasing ANY game form Valve, Half Life, Counter Strike, Portal - whatever.

249,"Having played and loved every C&C game, this one is an amazing disapointment.

Let's set aside for a moment the insane DRM that many people use to base their 1-star rating on...

EA Games had a brilliant line of games with the C&C Series.  They tried something new years ago with Renegade, creating a first-person shooter based on the series.  It was not well received, and EA didn't follow up on it.  You would think they would have learned their lesson.

As many have stated, this game would have been fine as a launch of a new C&C franchise.  It would have probably have flopped as badly as this, since the gameplay is very boring.  But why - WHY - did EA have to choose the penultimate C&C game to start the design from scratch?  How could any of the developers have not spoken up and said ""this is not C&C!""

Gone from this game is everything you knew and trusted about C&C.  No more base-building - at all.  You know those missions in the old games that you never really liked?  The ones where you were given a tiny handful of units and told to complete the level?  Well, that is what EVERY level of this game is like.

To make matters worse, you now have a roving unit-builder in every mission.  These come in three flavors - Attack, Defense, and Support.  The one you choose basically decides which units you can build.  You need to decide at the very start of every mission which type of unit you will use, yet you will have absolutely NOTHING to base you decision on.  If you choose incorrectly, your mission will be really difficult.  By the time I had finished the single-player campaign, I had STILL not been given the chance to use all of the units, nor had all of the power-ups been unlocked.  This game was so poorly thought out, it is a joke.

In this crapfest, instead of mining ore, you ""gain experience"" by picking up Tiberium crystals scattered around the map.  Let me repeat that - YOU gain experience - your opponents in the single player campaign do not.  The easy-to-find crystals are worth 5 attribute points.  You can use these to increase certain abilities, like a fast reload on your units, or faster units.  But in a typical level, these cost 1 point each, and there are only 4 powerups available on most levels.  So you collect one crystal and you instantly have maximum power for that level.  Is that insane, or what?  This is the kind of pointless ""fun"" you will experience on every level.  If you decide to go after multiple crystals, there appears to be no reward.  If there was, I never experienced it in the Single player game.

And let's talk for a moment about the story - or lack thereof.  Until now, every C&C game has at least had an interesting story - one that unfolded as you progressed.  Remember the time-travelling craziness with Einstein?  None of that here.  Honestly, I have no idea WHAT the plot was about.  In the NOD campaign, you play some soldier that (I guess) was killed and revived by Kane.  You are told that all hope rests on you.  Kane's very future is in your hands.  Yet, when you start your first mission, you have absolutely NO POWER whatsoever.  You start with ZERO experience points.  You are essentially a rookie.  Got that?  You are a Red Shirt, sent on some mission and YOU are Kane's only hope.  Heck, wasn't Kane ripping people apart using only his mind a few games ago?  Now for some reason he doesn't seem to have any power himself.  It's all up to a rookie...  What an incredible travesty EA has unleashed.

I used coupons to get my Amazon price down to $32.95 - I still feel cheated.

Now, back to the dreaded DRM...

If you purchase the DVD version of this game, you will have to do the following just to play it:
1) Open the box with the SECURITY device enclosed
2) Install the game using your COPY PROTECTED DVD
3) SIGN UP for an EA account
4) Enter the SECURITY KEY found in your manual
5) AGREE to have your PC monitored at all times while you play the game - even the single player version
6) Have SPYWARE installed on your PC
7) AGREE that even though you purchased the game, you do not OWN your copy
8) Launch the game with your ORIGINAL DVD in your PC
9) HOPE your Internet connection does not go down during a mission, or you will start all over again.

That's a heck of a lot of security just to play a game you purchased.  I'm seriously surprised there wasn't a specimen cup in the box...

Remember the days when you installed a game and launched it anytime you wanted?  Sure, you may have had to enter the 3rd word of line 12 of page 4 of your user guide.  Seriously, this game has every anti-pirating device known to man except for that one.  And you know what?  You can bet that 5 minutes after the game was officially released, the first cracked copy appeared on torrent sites.  Yet EA believes that by treating the customer as a criminal, they are winning the war against piracy.  Take a few minutes and look at every Amazon rating for games released with DRM in the past three years.  You will not find a single one that is over 2 stars.  People are royally P.O.'d at companies that treat the customer like this.  The backlash is enormous, yet they continue to do it.  And think about this - had the game not thoroughly sucked out loud, and had you wanted to take your laptop on a trip to play it, you had better have Internet access at all times.  No playing on a plane or in a car for you.  Because if you are not tethered to the EA computers and monitored at all times, you must be trying to steal something.

Whether you hate DRM like me, or whether you cannot possibly believe that EA seriously abandoned the entire concept of C&C - trust me - do NOT waste your money on this game.  I wanted so much to believe the negative reviews were simply due to the DRM.  Unfortunately, they are all dead-on.  This game is thoroughly unplayable, unenjoyable, and uninteresting.",positive

269,"Started off with a 4.5/5 star rating as you can see from my updates at the very bottom. Final rating is a 2/5.

I am near the end of the game (in about 18 hours no less). What started off as a nice, refreshing experience that pays homage to one of my favorite game series of all time quickly turns into a boring game with copious amounts of backtracking and little to no content aside from the main story. This isn't a Star Ocean game, it is the hollowed out corpse of a Star Ocean game.

The story isn't nearly as bad as other people have made it out to be. However, there is also little depth to the story. Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that you don't really care about the characters. Some of the private moments make no sense because there is no backstory to give it context.

The battle system is fine. One of the only good parts of the game.

The bulletin board quests are a joke. You can only do the same fetch X item quests so many times before it becomes monotonous.

The cities and towns are nice but there is nothing in them. The cities of star ocean 2 were half the size (or smaller in some cases) and yet there were tons more homes to enter, chests to gather, people to speak to. There is none of that in this game. The world map is no different. there are so few areas that they are forced to make new chests appear after certain points in the game in order for there to be some reason to explore.

There is no side content. Aside from the bulletin board quests, there really isn't much to do. The game just feels boring. Maybe that is why they don't allow you to save at certain points of the game. That way you will die, have to back track 20 minutes worth of stuff just to get back to where you were (the battle with Der-Suul).

One of my favorite parts of Star Ocean games is private actions and getting secret/optional characters. To this point, aside from endings, I couldn't find a single reason to continue to do PA's. I also hate the fact that there are NO secret/optional characters.

I don't really have an issues that there are some monsters from previous games as well as some music. To me, I enjoy that stuff. It doesn't feel cheap or like a short cut, it is nostalgic. I loved hearing some of the SO3 music from Kirlsa & Aquaria in this game. What I do have a problem with is that the only thing elements do is remind me of the former glory that Star Ocean had as a video game. Even with the short story and very linear game, it would have been fine with a great deal of post-game content. Although I am close to finishing the game, according to everything I have read, there isn't much to do.

Pick it up for $30 or something later on.

Update ---

I am now about 7 hours into the game. Still liking the game but I am adding some more Pro's and Con's and dropping the rating to 4 stars.

Pro's:
I like how they used some music from SO3 and incorporated it into this game. I also like the cathedral challenge thing. Pretty neat concept. I do like that there are a lot of enemies from other star ocean games and that the enemies change as you progress through the game. Story is good to this point (not great but good). I like the idea of harvesting/mining/fishing.

Con's: They have these big, beautiful cities and yet there is nothing to do in them. Private actions are minimal. In previous Star Ocean games you could enter almost every house in a given town/city to explore. The amount of treasure chests are minimal. I hate how battle skills aren't learned by levels but rather from miss able items.

So far it is still a good game and I would still recommend it to any Star Ocean fans. But I can't help but feel like they missed an opportunity to add more depth to this game. Also, as some people haven't been aware of this, if you are having camera issues you can zoom in and out using the d-pad.

-----

About 3 1/2 hours in and so far... I would give it 4.5 stars. Definitely feels like a Star Ocean game (which is great). It has many of the elements of a traditional JRPG. I loved Star Ocean 1, 2 and 3 but was not a fan of 4. The odd boss battles of 4 really turned me off (thankfully the boss battles in this game are more reminiscent of precious Star Ocean titles). As someone that has beaten Star Ocean 2 & 3 at least 5 times each, I am a big fan and 4 was just unplayable. I tried 4 different times to get into that game and I just couldn't. This game had me hooked almost instantly.

I really can't say much more other than I love the fact that the person that did the voice for Rena in the Star Ocean 2 PSP port also does the voice for a character in this game. So far the Item creation system seems good but I haven't progressed far enough to really test how complex and in depth it is.

I will continue to update this review as I get further. The one thing I am not a fan of is the in town environment. It isn't a huge deal but talking to NPCs can sometimes feel a bit awkward and clunky. Haven't had any issues with the camera as other people have but I can see why it would irritate some people.

Ignore the 1 star reviews that knock the story. Although I can't say for certain how it is, any 1 star review knocking the story can't be real as the game was just released today. How can you have seen any major plot twists or surprises when you haven't finished the game?",positive
270,Yes it works as advertised. Yes it keeps wrist and hand in a good position. It is light weight and moves easily. But that lightness means to use scroll wheel you need to grip mouse very tightly. This is necessary to keep mouse from moving all over the place. I have arthritis in my thumbs. So in my case unit isn't a good choice. I have to return it.,positive
271,"I can't believe people are rating this a 5. I've played Hearts of Iron I & II from Paradox and those were good fun. This however has little real game play interaction, combat is boring and never seems to end. There is no process for how combat is resolved. One navel battle took 3 weeks and this game is supposed to be historically accurate, where fantasyland? And of course there's the computer player which makes up it's own rules as it goes. If you're looking for something decent try one of the ""Total War"" games as they are probably the best. If you feel like wasting your money go buy grass seed, you'll enjoy yourself more watching the grass grow.",positive

273,Story mode is locked and it seems to be a common problem based on what I have read on the internet. Nobody really knows what is causing it to unlock if it eventually does and there is not even any information on the problem at the official website. This could be a cool game if it worked.,negative
274,"This what you need to know:

1) Game is just as buggy has HALO MCC: Constant disconnections.

2) Game does not always register commands (build a building success rate is 10% as it usually does not register).

3) Select a unit may or may not circle the units selected indicating it is selected (it may only show circles on 4 out of 5 units)

4) Setting rally points almost never registers.

5) Units usually respond to x or y controllers indicating they should move but there is about a 20% failure rate here.

6) Halo Definitive Edition - No one is on multiplayer and it remains unplayable

So many more issues to name.

This game is a simple hack and slash with a lot of wasted time running and searching.  The graphics are nothing to write home about--a little cartoony.  The sound effects are mediocre.  The action is repetitive and pointless.

Don't be fooled by press jobs.  There is no strategy here.  There is no action game here.  State of Decay is basically Facebook or iPhone quality gaming, hyped up to make money from PC gamers.

The premise is a good one.  Survive a zombie outbreak and build communities, find resources, etc.  But a good idea does not make a good game.  This game will bore you to tears.  Combat is not fun.  Searching is not fun.  Running across maps is not fun.  Why play a GAME if it is not FUN?  What a waste.

Your character walks slower than an 80 year old lady even though there's a fire and buildings are crashing around him and there's some crazy malevolent force trying to eat you. If you go into first person view to see what you're doing or get a better angle on something, it kicks back to 3rd person as soon as you turn a certain way. It literally would not stay in first person for the life of me. And to walk, you use one stick to move forward and one stick to move directionally....it was horribly done.

The main thing I don't like about this game is all the different races and Clank Challenges that you have to go through for items. This is primarily what I don't like. Still if you're a Ratchet and Clank fan, like myself, it's worth playing once or twice. I heard some people liked it better on the PSP, so I'll glance at to see if it entices me.

A text box comes up, you have to read all the options, choose one then continue.  This game has no resemblance to the original Minecraft other than the characters.

I pretty much run out of ammo all the time and it gets very frustrating dying over and over again. You cannot just run away from the enemy because they chase after you.

293,"This is the first Nintendo DS superhero video game that I've sold off. My kids were really excited to try Spider-Man 3 (having played the GBA games before). After the first day, my kids won't pick this game up anymore.

Why?

Well, the combination of button controls and stylus web swinging is just too much for their little hands. They are overwhelmed by the controls. I've read a bunch of reviews that like the use of the stylus but even those reviews admit that you get mixed results (your intended move doesn't always translate on screen).

Meanwhile, my kids were underwhelmed by the gameplay. You'd think New York City is populated by 98% felons. Spider-man doesn't meet anyone who he doesn't have to punch, kick or throw around. Quickly, this becomes work instead of play.

My kids prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-Friend-or-Foe/dp/B000TEJFMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</a>&nbsp;and frequently play together (Check out my Amazon review: I bought an extra copy so they could play together.)

Much was made about the Tobey Maguire voiceovers but they didn't lend enough to this game to add another star. My kids liked the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B00114XU56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>&nbsp;voiceovers better.

294,"I was looking for a good, cheap replacement for my wireless 360 controller and I didn't want to spend a ton of money to buy a new one. Since this one has gotten good reviews, I decided to give it a chance.

At first, I thought it was pretty ok. The buttons and sticks, which were a little too loose in my opinion, took a while to get adjusted to. Once I was use to it though, I enjoyed using it far more than my 360 controller because it's slimmer and easier to handle.

That being said, There are problems with it. Sometimes it will not sync up to the 360 at all despite being plugged in and syncing the previous time so I will have to unplug it then plug it back in, Doesn't happen often but when it does it's annoying. The controller will constantly act up as well, such as moving on-screen on it's own without me touching it, so I have to constantly unplug it and plug it back in in order to fix it. As of late though, It's been doing it far more frequently and it's getting on my nerves. So a little over 4 months after owning it and it's already on it's way out.

That is why I give this controller a 1 star and would not recommend it. Better off saving your money and buying a legit Microsoft 360 controller that will actually last. Then again, That's the risk you take for trying to save a buck.",positive

301,"*** Will be updating this review by tier patches to keep it current. ***

Heads up: The Amazon reviews on MoP were posted on MMO-Champion which can cause an influx of positive reviews and thumbs up, which can skew the results of what MoP is currently.

This is equal to posting a thread on a fanboi forum, with the results as some ""come back"".

MoP has brought positive things into the WoW universe for diverse playstyles especially casual gamers, but on the other hand it has ruined gameplay across the board, too.

Think about this before buying MoP:

A. Game is full of mobs: some sub-classes don't have a single AoE until level 90 (yes, level 90). This forces you to buy MoP to even farm older content (this is DLC at it's worst).
B. CRZ (Cross Realm Zoning) an effort to make more players appear in the world -- causes nightmares for levelers (mobs being stolen; nodes now shared by 10+ realms; huge mobs of level 85+ players ganking lower level PvPers and quest NPCs).
C. Can only obtain epics via raiding. No more valor epics (now imagine the hell of trying to gear out your alts before the next patch).
D. Not enough players to have 25man raids outside LFR (which rewards inferior gear to normal raids). Forget 24/7 ICC 25mans again.
E. Storage problems for transmorg gear (appearance armor) and even carrying an extra set of different spec gear -- each expansion gains only 4 extra slots per bag. Players will still be hampered with a 16 slot bag holding them back (hardcoded, and Blizzard doesn't want to touch fixing hardcode).
F. TBC faction grinding. Blizzard claimed to not wanting to return to this as players don't prefer to grind endlessly for quickly outdated items (items that will be useless in 2 patches).
G. Asian F2P theme that now costs a subscription to play.

And the worst thing of all: generic classes and no real choices as talents (picking between 2 stuns for a tier is a choice?). It's now ""bring the player, not the class"" which becomes more of ""why do we have so many sub-classes if we do the same things?"" All healers heal the same, no specialization. DPS classes have similiar abilities, so a warrior may have different spells than a Ret paladin, but they play the same -- and the warrior can heal himself as effectively as a paladin.

Balance issues are the same as in vanilla, TBC, WotLK, and Cata: FoTM class will be the favorite. Blizzard's fix on Warlocks? Make dispelling DoTs on 8+ second timers, so damage stays despite as a healer you're suppose to remove them (and you can't heal through them bacause it costs too mana).

Then they removed mana from exact numbers to percentages. Not an issue to many, unless they're healers. Because to tell a healer at a glance is to see their size of their mana pool. Now since we all have 100k mana, that Shadow Priest can sneak in as a healer and grief (there's still no consequences for players griefing dungeons/LFR).

BTW, to answer the question of why so many 1 star reviews: it's because the WoW forums and MMO-C make sure to ban those who don't tow the company line. Amazon doesn't have a horse in this race, and it shows.

So beware of glowing 5 star reviews that doesn't balance the review with the problems ingame, as that can be addiction and fanboism hyping the game. Research the issues and see if it's worth the time and effort to play WoW, and if it's worth the money ($39 + $14.99/mon subscription). No one can decide that for you, but armed with the information, you can make the wisest choice. Not become another ""More players have played WoW than are currently playing WoW"", because they got tired of the hype not living up to expectations.

ADDED - 12/10/2012 - Resubbed to level my main to 90 and to see what has happened 3 months into the game:

1. Except for the Tillers area, the MoP areas are essentially dead on a medium population realm. Prime time, included.
2. Seven Stars area (similiar to Dalaran and Shattah in other expansions), as dead as Dalaran before CRZ after WotLK. Prime time, included.
3. Starting MoP areas, about as dead as Zangarmarsh after TBC.
4. 5.1 patch: new faction area, dead. You would see more people in Hyjal in Cata without CRZ or Molten Front.
5. Possible reasons for the loss of players:
5.a. Only way to gear out is via doing faction dailies for weeks (dungeon gear is worse; and just farming dungeons for very small amounts of Valor to buy the faction gear with, is boring).
5.b. Contested bosses (like Galleon) results in faction griefing, as Blizzard (like with the release of LFR) still doesn't understand public group dynamics and trolls.
5.c. Disgust in Diablo III release, and players just tired of Blizzard's antics, best shown for what it became...

[...]

When Blizzard is ""at war"" with the players and approving troll posts, it's no wonder how/why not only the WoW forums resembles alt.flame, the culture ingame resembles that chaos.

ADDED - 5/13/2013 - Patch 5.2 Review

On May 8, 2013 Activision-Blizzard released it's quarterly stock report: From January to March of 2013, 1.3 million (14% of the overall subscription base in US/EU/Asia) have unsubscribed. This is the second worst drop in subscriptions (Cata seen the worst with 1.7 million), and most troubling, this is even after a tier patch (where players will normally see an uptick of resubscribers for 3 months).

Players have voted with their wallet and feet about the game's direction.

WoW has also seen one of the top world first 25man raid guilds fold due to the excessive timesinking. With a possibility this will happen down the rank and file, as raid guilds are struggling to find raiders for the same reasons. Alliance on my realm hasn't even downed the normal boss on 10 man and it's been 3 months. The usual Walmart-sized alt guilds that raid, even they can't get 10 players to raid. Tired, bored and ""hanging in"" they LFR instead. Even the enhanced 25man loot drops isn't bringing raiders back.

(Why? Raid lock outs and the meaningless destruction to healing [can't find healers now] and PuGs to gear out alts. Blizzard now admits, after 3 years, the raid locking has been a mistake. Three years too late. Just waiting on the ""We're sorry about the healing changes"" next).

LFR is the method to drain those Mogu charms for 29g, as you'll spend it in an effort to see anything but 29g, as players rage of the horrible RNG (and if lucky, get gear with the worst stats). It has essentially replaced normal raiding.

Heroic dungeons are dead. Put a fork in them. Not a means for valor, gear or even for story (that's the rep grind dailies -- which continue on...).

On the PvP side: with the BGs filled with bots and multiboxers, good luck in winning games to gain CP or honor within your lifetime. Folks are even beginning BGs naked for ""fun"", while the auto-pathing and auto-attacking bots begin their usual crossroads bashing, ensuring winning a game due to the lack of capping objectives is lost. Wintrading is still going on in RBGs and arenas, so you'll see Field Marshals in BGs dying like n00bs.

Crafting: leveling Blacksmithing is a lot easier at level 90. But once you get to level 600 in it, and got those sweet Reborn weapon and Haunted Steel plans, it's a 19 day wait to make a ilvl 502 (only LFR quality) weapon. Lightning Steel is soulbound, so you will wait 19 days to craft it. Reagent Haunting Spirit is so difficult to obtain, to make the helm alone, will cost around 80,000g if you buy the 6 needed. Why such an insane price? 50% disenchanting possibility. That's not bad? Only comes off of Tier 15 raid quality (not vendor purples) gear. It'll take, with perfect RNG, disenchanting 16 pieces of tier 15 gear to get 8 to craft 1 helm. Remember even alt guilds can't get 10 players to raid, right? The recipes sit in the recipe book laughing at you, ""You were never intended to craft me..hahaha!"".

Meanwhile, for 5.3 Blizzard is improving the Pet Battles turning it into the same mess we see in classes and class ""balance""...

307,"EDIT: Gee isn't it awfully STRANGE that the seller withdrew this item 1 day immediately after I reviewed it & revealed the game for what it was? Hmmm... what an odd coincidence. But consider yourself warned (& smarter for it): ANY Pokemon game that comes ""pre-loaded"" with every single item & pokemon, including rare event-only ones, all lvl. 100 shinies with maxed-out stats (that likely would NEVER pass the legit-checker Nintendo uses to pass or fail pokemon entered in official tournament use), no matter what the title, is the same exact thing as this game here. They are simply games started, altered by an Action Replay, and saved by the seller, who typically charges a RIDICULOUS amount of money for something you could do yourself for a fraction of the cost. What good are all those pokemon if you can't use them for tournament use (or even just battling a friend) because they stick out like a sore AR code, practically screaming ""I'm a hack!!!"" NO ONE is going to want to play vs. you with a hack team!

NOTE: Please realize the star rating is NOT FOR THE GAME ITSELF (Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen are 5/5 stars IMO), but this ""All 386"" version of the game that comes with ALL the pokemon and all the items in one's possession at the start of the game.

Why on earth anyone would ever want to start a pokemon game with a 100% filled-out pokedex, every pokemon in one's possession (and every single one SHINY!?) all LVL.100, and every item in existence in one's possession is beyond comprehension. IT RUINS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE GAME. Plus you're not even going to be able to use them right from the beginning since you won't be able to control lvl. 100 pokemon until you've got most of the badges! Even if you want the pokemon for battling others, they're going to be OBVIOUSLY non-legit since the odds of having an all-shiny party is 1 in 50,000 at the very LEAST. Your versus partner doesn't have to be a genius to realize, instantly, you're using cheated pokemon. The fun of the game is discovering new pokemon as the story unfolds & you venture from town to town, catching pokemon in the wild and finding rare items some of which will help certain pokemon evolve. If you start off with EVERYTHING, then what more is there to do?! Running through the storyline is without reason, and if there's nothing to discover then you might as well not even bother playing in the first place. And what good are lvl. 100 pokemon if they haven't any further opportunity to raise the IV & EV stats through party use? That's right, IV & EV scores no longer count once the pokemon is lvl. 100, so who knows what kind of disposition or stats these ready-made, ""instant pokemon"" have? Are they even friendly, like a lvl. 100 pokemon (a legit one, raised from, say, lvl. 10) should be? Or are the stats ridiculously maxed out, making their non-legit-ness even MORE glaringly obvious?

But the real tragedy of this RIP OFF is the ridiculous price tag!! You're not PHYSICALLY getting anything more than if you just bought the game off the shelf of a retail store. You're getting a regular old game cartridge, nothing special about it other than the game has already been started & saved, and then they used an ACTION REPLAY device on the cartridge to cheat and insert all the pokemon in the PC boxes and own every item. Be aware that you'll be stuck using whatever name THEY picked as the OT name, and if you attempt to start the game over, you will LOSE everything they gave you under the first OT's name!

What's sad is that they're preying on uninformed SUCKERS with the lure of being a ""pokemaster"" with that ungodly price (at least $180.00, sometimes upwards of $200.00). They ruin the game for you, which you can just as easily DO YOURSELF for a LOT LESS COST by simply buying yourself an Action Replay (or the defunct Gameshark) code altering device, a cost of $20-$30 and even less if you shop around or get a used one. You can use the same exact codes they used ~ AR & GS codes for ALL Pokemon games are available all over the net, and from the official AR website as well; plus you can update your AR for automatic update for the latest codes by hooking up with your PC, with a cord & disk with software that comes with the AR. It's very easy to use & you can input codes manually or copy & paste codes onto the AR device from codes you find on the web. What they do to the game is in no way worth the additional $150+!! All they do is start a game, press a few buttons, save, and there you go, every pokemon & all items are in the PC. I know for a fact there are codes available that do that very same thing. So why would anyone pay $180+ when they could buy the game retail for $30 and the AR for $20-$30, a total of $50-$60...far less than HALF of what they're charging uninformed people who just don't know how to use an AR or realize how easy it is. You can use the AR for never fail captures, running into ANY pokemon, getting ANY pokemon as SHINY, and also even for getting EVENT POKEMON into your possession without having gone to an event (which is likely OVER, & never to come out again for this game)...and you don't even need to ruin the entire game if you just want to cheat a little. Plus, you can continue using the AR for code manipulation for ANY other GBA game!

Don't support these RIPOFF ARTISTS, they are a SHAM, charging an outrageous price for something anyone with a GBA, Pokemon cartridge, and AR device could do the same for much, much less! And you won't be stuck using someone else's trainer name!",neutral
308,"Before I bought this, I read a lot of the reviews here. I saw mostly positives, but some negatives. The negative reviewers seemed to mostly go on and on about how complex the game is. ""Sure whatever,"" I thought to myself. ""Those people are just 80-year old grandmas who don't even know anything about video games."" Boy, was I wrong!

First off, let me be clear. I'm a big fan of the first two Lego Star Wars trilogies, plus the Indiano Jones Lego game. I've also played Lego Batman. Those games are AWESOME. My two kids and I love them, especially the Star Wars ones. So with Lego Clone Wars, I hoped we would have just as much fun. But the game isn't fun.

The original Star Wars Lego games are a blast. They are relatively easy. You fight your way through areas, do a few simple puzzles every now and then, and unlock guys. If that's what you are expecting with Clone Wars, let me disavow you of that notion right now!

In this game, they have SERIOUSLY upped the difficulty level. The gameplay mechanics have also been made significantly more complex. The puzzles have all become a lot harder too. Gone is anything easy to figure out. I'm a veteran gamer, and even I was struggle to figure out what to do next in this game, even on the beginning levels!

Also, level objectives are now much more vague. Oftentimes, we couldn't even figure out where we were supposed to go or what we were supposed to do. This has made the game more challenging, but not in a good way. It has made things confusing. I chalk this up to bad game design.

Another thing I don't like is the ""busy-ness"" of the graphics. The other Lego games have clean, simple graphics. Where most of the things you see are made out of Legos. Here, it is not the case. Everything has been replaced with more realistic-looking graphics, like something you might see out of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III or Battlefront. The Lego characters interact in this realistic-looking environment, and the effect is really jarring.

Something else I hate in this game are the bosses. The bosses in the other Star Wars games are relatively easy affairs. Fun to play, especially for kids. Not in this game! The very first boss we fought, it took us about half an hour to beat. In Clone Wars, you don't just fight bosses. You have to do multiple varying things to beat them. The whole time we were playing, I just kept thinking to myself, ""You have GOT to be kidding me!"" I mean, what the heck are we playing here? Ninja Gaiden???

All this may be okay for a teenager. But it is not suitable for little kids at all. There is NO WAY a kid will be able to play these games on their own. You'll have to do everything for them.

I am really disappointed, overall. In an attempt to add depth and complexity to the game, the programmers forgot who the game is for: kids. They may be patting themselves on the back for their cleverness, but I think it stinks.

In conclusion, if your kids are Star Wars freaks and just have to have this game, then by all means, buy it. But it may not be the game you expect. Don't say you haven't been warned!",negative

310,"As i wrote about Fallout 3 and Skyrim some time ago , again this is a failed product , as for all three games i managed to post at one time or another over 60 glitches on YouTube for all the glitches and crashes and freeze ups. After replacing 3 hard drives because of forced restarts this company failed in trying to make the product work instead of a deadline and having a lot of negative feedback that drove people to go to games like Bioshock or Mass Effect 3. The story is cool and like about Fallout 3 , it was a original idea and had some cool backgrounds on the events and characters within the game. But the undertone of homosexuality in some of the characters took me off the game story line as not important to the events in New Vegas , the question is Why put it there? Political or social problems in the game designers lives? So that was a factor for me in one of many issues in the game , and it's bad enough the game promotes violence for one , but it's moral content of homosexuality is a bit far. As for the game , graphics is fine , but needs way more options to make it more real , Bioware is close with Dragon's Age 2. Freeze ups and glitches pretty much ruined it for me , it took 8 profiles to get all achevements and took 11 to finish the game because of code error in the profiles from all the force rebooting the PS3.

Overall a 1 , i would give less if i could , and rest assured this company has lost another costumer period.",negative

312,"Don't get me wrong I love Final Fantasy but FFX is poo! First you might be expecting a 4 disc set like previous versions but this one is a one disk game.  This means less space for a variety of music (The battle song gets real old real fast) and less space for graphics (All the good graphics are the same as they show you on the commercial, nothing new) after you see all the good graphics Square really skimps on the characters details.

314,"My console game CRASHED!?!  Within the first hour of playing.  In the middle of a BOSS Fight, without letting me save before hand.  Which means that I have to ""START"" the game all over again, as if I NEVER played it at all.

Are you f__king kidding me?  A console game crashed?  Did I just step back into the 80's?  On the Atari 2600?  It's 2009, THIS should be a NON-issue.  I mean really?  That's the whole reason that you play games on a console -- because this kind of thing should NEVER HAPPEN.

But it did, and I don't want to play it again and have MOVE-ON to something else -- that DOESN'T CRASH.  I didn't get defeated and have to restart the level over again, the game crashed!  Basically, Ubisoft through this game out the door.  How did you miss something like THAT?  How many game have you made?  How many programmers did you have on your staff --- nobody caught this bug?  This is what we call a ""Major Class A Bug"" -- one that stops the game play completely.

With your crappy ""Image"" Series, and now this?  I'm sorry, but Ubisoft cannot be trusted to make good games at all.  And you have NOTHING but yourselves to blame.  No game reviewer told me anything, that I didn't figure out on my own with $[...] bucks less in my pocket.",neutral

Enemies in this game are more difficult than they should be and mercilessly pummel you even on the easiest setting.

320,"This game uses the same horrible DRM scheme that is found on Bioshock, Mass Effect, Crysis Warhead, Spore, Dead Space, Sacred 2, and Red Alert 3. I refuse to purchase a game that requires me to ask permission to install the game. There are several games that I own that I have had to install more than five times for various reasons. That is why I refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times I can install the game, let alone a DRM program (like SecuRom) that could be considered a trojen horse.

As a side note, this DRM method does nothing to stop piracy. All of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some, like spore, even before their release (with the exceptions of Sacred 2 and Red Alert 3 which have not been released yet, however the developers confirmed that they would use the SecuRom activation DRM scheme). The only thing this DRM does do is prevent this game from entering the used game market.",negative
321,"My kids love all the Lego games. I realized this is like Disney Infinity and Skylanders where you have to buy the characters to unlock them. What I did not expect was that the characters would not register if they had minor alterations (i.e mission weapons). We've had the game for two days and my boys love playing it, but my 8 year old did a little experiment and I was severely disappointed with the outcome. He took Batman's batrangs and swapped them out with a sword from a different Lego character. He turned the game on and Batman would not register as on the board with the the sword. We removed the sword and he still wouldn't register until we put both batrangs back in his hands. Those batrangs are tiny, as are Legos in general, and this game is so fussy it will not recognize the character without one tiny weapon! The discs they stand on should be sufficient for recognition when you're paying around $35 for each new character pack. You also know your kids will want to play with the Legos. They'll lose pieces guaranteed and that you'll probably accidentally vacuum up some pieces at some point. I knew this was a greedy marketing scheme just from the having to purchase all the characters, but then they made it extra dirty by making the characters unplayable if you lose a piece.",negative

337,"Way way too much batmobile. I thought the batmobile would be more of neat gimmick, i.e. GTA style but it is not. You are forced to use the batmobile way way way way too much.

Also this game has *specific* ways you must defeat certain enemies, which made for many infuriating moments and I had to use the internet to figure out how to get past enemies. Specifically the big gunners, you must pummel, dodge, pummel, dodge over and over until they go down. Any other technique you use they are invincible too. The 1st big gunner I encountered, I snuck up and hit, then hid, over and over for 10 minutes and he would never go down. I used bombs on the walls, the ground, cape stuns, flying kicks, I really thought it was a glitch cause he was invincible. Then I google how to beat them, and I take him down in 10 seconds. So stupid!!

The worse one though was the Pyg side mission, you must use an environmental take down, which I forgot was even a thing. So you can imagine how long this took. I beat up the 50 thugs he threw at me, and then marvelled at Pyg's ability to repeatedly dodge countless batarangs, cape stuns, punches every time. He just moved around a very tiny table, and Batman of all people *can't* touch him. Seems impossible right? Then I again have to google how to beat him, 2 seconds later with Square and X and goes down. Beyond stupid!!!!

Like I get it, they designers wanted to have ""cool"" finishes to the battles, but what they instead did by forcing users to do this is make for a very UNREALISTIC and INFURIATING game.

I can't stress enough how ANGRY I was at this game so often while playing it. No other Batman game in the series did this. And then to top it off I spent half my time in the batmobile, which is really a TANK and I'm forced into these TANK battles. How is this a Batman game at this point? And I stress I'm not exaggerating, HALF THE GAME is TANK BATTLES. Which I hated, and I was bad at it, so I kept dying, and had to hear the same cut scene spiel, something like ""You never stood a chance Batman"", then wait 45 seconds for it to load, then die again over and over. Honestly if there was an option I would have paid for DLC to *remove* the batmobile from the game!!!!

Finally, the game breaking bug at the end of the game was the cherry on top. I've learned from reading in forums that after beating the Scarecrow, you need to capture at least 7 of 14 of Gothams Most Wanted in order to activate the final ""Knightfall Protocol"". Specifically, you beat Scarecrow, and then it wants you to capture ""at least 1 more of Gothams Most Wanted"". So you can capture 8, or 9 etc, and then you decide when to trigger the ""Knightfall protocol"".

HOWEVER, I beat every side mission before taking down the Scarecrow EXCEPT all the Riddler puzzles. Which now means in order to activate the ""Knightfall protocol"" (i.e. capture 1 more most wanted) I need to capture the Riddler. But to get the Riddler to come out, I need to spend the next few nights hunting down 243 Riddler puzzles. You're kidding right??? Even if I knew precisely where they were, that's just *busy work* at this point. Batman, the world's greatest detective can't figure out where the Riddler is on his own?

And note, had I just been lazy and did the bare minimum of 7, I could see the ending. But since I did 13 of 14, I fee like I'm being punished and I don't get to see the ending unless I want to spend so much more time.

Thankfully on youtube I got to see the ending, but man this game I tell you!!! It's just the worst of the 4 Arkham games. Graphics are amazing the the overall story would make a great comic book, but the game play is INFURIATING!! So very INFURIATING.",negative

339,"Overall, this game is horrible.  After finishing the game in two or three days, I deleted it off my PS3 to never be played again.

The game has the rare good points, but overall, it was a waste of money.  I enjoy the walking dead series, the comics, and somewhat Telltale's game.

The game takes maybe five hours of game play to finish it.  Estimating the time is difficult because there is like a 4 minute load time every single time you die or have to stop for gas or supplies, and I also lost interest until I forced myself to play again.

The only interesting mechanic in the game is that there are no powered-up enemy/zombies.  Still, you can fight off one zombie easy enough.  Put two zombies together and the game makes fighting them stupid.  You have to continually push the zombies to stun them, but it only works with one at a time.

The mechanic is usually push the zombie, bash the zombie.  The number of bashes/slashes depends on the weapon equipped.  Use a gun, all kinds of zombies show up to kill you in no time.  The crossbow is cool.  Still, keeping track of the reusable crossbow bolts is a pain, and it comes in maybe the last level or two.

There is an RPG element to it that is really only surface deep.  The NPCs pick up like one MRE and need like three to get their health back.  The biggest car allows you to pack three people in, but by the time you get it, you will only have like two NPCs.  Still, the NPCs are worthless to begin with.",negative

345,"First off, I waited to get this game since I usually wait to pay about half price but also because of the amount of problems that people said were there at launch so this review is after a lot of the launch problems were gone or at least should be gone.

The good parts of this game are the story, the architecture is pretty awesome, and the main character is likeable which has been the case in all except AC3, but other than that the game is a disappointment with nothing new, a lot of problems, and a lot of old aspects of previous games not included.

Problems:

1) The movement is glitchy.......and even when it doesn't glitch for the amount of running that you will do the movements are slow and labored......A faster movement system even if it is unrealistic is preferable than a slow one with unresponsive controls

2) Combat glitches....variety of them including none of the buttons responding

3) Disjointed side missions.......No continuity, each side mission is it's own quick mission that is easy, mostly negligible rewards, and most of the time can't hear or don't care what the point is......Really no point to do any of these unless you really need to get money which is easier to get by upgrading the base

4) Co-op Play.......If you don't have PS plus than you can't upgrade Arno all the way (I do have PS plus) as you need to play these missions to get him fully upgraded........Forces you to play with other people instead of letting you play a normal  single player campaign.....Basically these are the missions that should have been single player side missions in the game

5) You don't get to build a network of assassins to send out on contracts or missions which wasn't a great part of the other games that used this but is something that could be really cool if they made it more detailed and improved.......and it was at least somewhat interesting to have in the old games that had it

6) Micro-paying scam........not going to do it myself but just the fact that it is in the game is annoying........not rationale but I know other people who feel the same way about buying a game and than being asked to pay more into it, on top of the DLC if somebody chooses to buy that also

7) Numerous and long load times.......self explanatory but get ready to wait

8) Chests and Cockades........many of them with very little reason to collect

9) Enigmas.........These are nowhere near as fun as the Templar vaults or whatever they were called in the Ezio games (I think they were in the second Ezio Assassin Creed game).........Pretty much collect vague clues and try to remember what buildings are what or search the cluttered map for a name and click eagle vision and wait for the cool down to finish

10) Vantage points...They made these more interesting at some point in the series where some were/attached to Templar bases, again something that should be expanded on instead of thrown away

*****11) Your are in the French Revolution????.......Literally very little has happened to coincide with the historical even, I am on sequence 8 of 12 so maybe something later in the game makes the connection, but this late in the game and it has very little impact on the game........I had the same problem with the AC3 as you pick the setting and than your character is doing his own thing instead of making him influence the history etc etc

***Spoiler Alert***
I passed the following levels: Nightmare, Missing persons and I reached the hotel(first boss, Sepulcher).
After getting over the crappy fighting system, slowdowns and graphic bugs, I was excited to fight the damn boss.
While I was trying to hit the meat sacks of the boss, the game targeted the boss itself and NOT the meat sacks. Ok, I dealt with that and I destroyed all 3(or 4) meat sacks and the boss fell on the floor. The next step, you have to hit his hands so he will collapse and you will hit his head and kill him. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. I couldn't target his hands, I was walking THROUGH his hands, he could hit me but I couldn't harm him. I was swinging the axe into the air and COULD NOT HIT THE BOSS OR HIS HANDS. After about 10 attempts, youtube and walkthrough checks, I rage quit and I threw the game away.

352,"I have all of the Battlefield games, I started with BF1942 many years ago and played all of them up to BF4. I have few problems with crashing in BF4, but the gameplay is very odd in BF4.  For XBOX, the maps are huge, but keep in mind, there are only 24 players MAX. So you will be playing against 12 players.  These new maps are designed for Sniping, so if you love sniping you will love this game! But for others who love the ground game and crazy gun fights, you will hate this as I do...
So you play against a possible MAXIMUM 12 enemies, and half the team is camping and sniping (on the tallest building they can find).  That leaves 6 players and 3 of those are hogging air and ground vehicles, so you will fight against the remaining 3 players who are on the ground (mostly because the rest of their team took off in vehicles so they have to hoof it everywhere), which means you do A LOT of running just to get to the enemy, only to be sniped or killed by the vehicle and the chopper guy, who won't get out of the chopper and the snipers who keep respawing on skyscrapers...
YAWNFEST is what BF4 is...

Mar 22, 2014 update!
I thought there was something wrong with my Xbox, because I kept crashing and the graphics were turning pink and blue and yellow, etc... But I can play other games just fine. BF4 is the culprit!

Single Player Campaign  is really short. (5 Hours)
Controls are sluggish.
Hit detection is off.
Takes alot  of shots sometime in the head to get it to detect it and the enemy finally dies.
You can get hung up on a little rock and the enemy can shoot you behind rock cover as well.
And it is very laughable on how your character throws grenades.

The story itself wasn't flawed. Just the way it was carried out within the game. Framerate slows down to where the screen studders along.

Multiplayer (Updated) Finally 24 hours later was able to play the multiplayer portion.
Multiplayer has potential once the server issues and glitches are fixed. But does it make up for the campaign short falls? Yes It Does.

For a game that has been out 24 hours and with the server problems you still have people maxed out on rank all ready.

Overall this isn't worth the $60 I paid for it. And still isn't worth the $41 they are selling it for now.

The number of maps is almost uncountable and will provide for many centuries of play time. Every map design is perfectly balanced so that there aren't too many vehicles, rendering all classes except Anti-Tank obsolete. Additionally, the placement of weapon emplacements is perfect, making none of them useless. They finally added game types other than the same old Domination game. The in game communications menus are not cumbersome to use. The single player AI is vastly improved over previous versions of the Battlefield series and you'll find that all of the tricks you used to get around the AI in older Battefield versions will no longer work. You will find that your single player games are varied and surprising. You will find that all of the people who play Battlefield 2 online are both talented and well versed in good sportsmanship, and all your interaction with them will be entirely suitable for all members of your family - you won't need to worry about turning the sound completely off while you play! They will never teamkill you, or take a tank you were heading for and claim you are of an alternative sexual orientation after doing it, and do so on every server you join. Playing Multiplayer Battlefield 2 is incredibly fun, especially when the server you're playing on doesn't crash, which never happens. Multiplayer Battlefield 2 is never laggy or sluggish. The game never crashes to Windows, especially not at the tail end of long fought closely contested battles. Let me repeat that: the game NEVER crashes! Ever!

378,"I am going to reveal the ending, so do not read ahead if you still want to play this game.
Many others have already posted their opinions here, so I will not go through the whole game in detail.
But as many others have said, the voice-acting for the Obi-Wan character is ridiculously, unintentionally humorous -- the actor sounds like a guy with a head cold trying to imitate Ewan McGregor doing Obi-Wan, exaggerating the distinctive traits McGregor's Scottish accent -- so even lilts in his voice are thrown into hyperdrive. (as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept. gave to Qui-Gon Jinn -- yes, the bridge on Liam Neeson's nose may be somewhat big, but since when did he have Karl Malden's nose?)
The game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department -- sometimes you can't see features on faces.
But onto the ending. The game is fun, with a handful of challenging levels -- mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind high-powered laser cannons.
But it's marred by a disappointingly quick and all-too-easy ending. The moment arrives -- you finally meet Darth Maul. Just like in the movie, you stand behind the laser wall and watch as Qui-Gon is struck down by Maul.
And finally the wall opens, you hold your breath, ready for a tough battle -- one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out. But it's not to be.
Darth Maul is ridiculously easy to defeat. I beat him on my first try and in less than a minute. And you have to fight him twice -- as once you take him down the first time, he gets a new, full meter of health. So in less than a minute, I drew down two full health meters. I felt cheated, to say the least.
I remember fighting against Mace Windu to have to reach the next level, and I had to go toe to toe against him some 20 to 30 times before I finally beat him. I was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty, but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game. All I had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and Maul was done.
How in the world could the game's makers create such a lackluster, lifeless, no-threat ending battle? I was left extremely wanting, and if it were a movie, I would have angrily asked for my money back. I cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was. Even more now, the Darth Maul character cries out for a game of his own. One can only wish -- for this Maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fight.",negative

I played Red Faction, and it was a great FPS for its day and still is with great sound, a good selection of weapons, gore, and a so so story that was pretty much the "" Total Recall"" of first person shooters.

The 2nd Red Faction... ehh --- it had great character designs but the whole super solider/zombie creatures were a bit much and most of your guns were worthless because everyone seemed to be walking tanks as far as fire fights were concerned. At least they had pretty good voicing and a few awesome vehicles like the first one did.

Now we come to this... RF: Guerrilla. Poor sound quality if I ever heard of it ( I've seen the other reviews) but even if you weren't on Mars in 4040 ( when ever it starts), I have to go back to the original Red Faction and say that the experience was much better and dare I say it, even had better graphics to some extent. Why did they drop the 1st person? They could have just as easily made it so you can switch back and fourth --- would that have been too much to ask?

The action seemed forced to me. One moment your driving to some salvage yard and the next moment, an air ship comes, blows the character's brother away...and wallah. Now all of a sudden your part of the Red Faction. I mean please.

I would say Twisted Metal Black meets Monster Truck World on Mars --- mixed in with some poor gun fighting and architectural destruction. I think the creators of this one spent so much time with the destruction of buildings that they let the rest of the game decompress into outer space --- even the landscape wasn't much to look at, I found my self thinking...  Wow. A dusty mish mash of dirt trails with construction cars driving all over the place, I suppose if I were some Tonka Truck loving fool, I would be in heaven.

So you want to play a bomber in Mars eh? It wouldn't have been so bad if not for that whole 1 man army routine where your only aloud oh-so-many explosives before the entire world drops down on you and your Swiss cheese --- let alone prevented from collecting the salvage you made because you need to hop n' skip out of there! The thing with aiming and shooting wouldn't be all that bad if you just allowed the player to go to 1st person!  I mean c'mon, Red Faction 1 and 2 were! --- what made you suddenly change up...and on the PS3 too?

So no I don't think this was on par with the others, in fact, a dude running around with explosives and a sledge hammer is some what comical don't you think? Plus -- what a sledge hammer it is huh? He can take down just about any and all buildings, even heavily fortified complexes with soldiers in and all around it. Why I think if you just stood in the middle of mars and started to pound away, there's no reason to assume he couldn't make himself a nice tunnel strait through it and collapse the integrity of the planet. I wonder if his tool had  "" Made In Neo-China""  on the handle and can be bought at your local hardware store --- we can call it  "" Benny's Drills N Thrills""  after that mutant guy with the collapsible forearm.  This is like "" Falling Down 2: Miner's Revenge"" where when you run out of your faulty explosives, you can just go gangsta and crush the place down with a bunch of whacks...and guess what folks? He never misses a beat so he's one fit miner!

There can be fun however, you can take your frustration out by breaking just about everything and its pretty interesting to see people attempting to shop at what looks to be a convenient store after you bashed it to bits.

Now for the good part of this game. It does allow you to manipulate and break just about anything that walks or stands which is a cool idea. The bomb expert portion is also a great idea! Placing chargers in places you hope will bring a building down. There is a wide verity of vehicles for you to use --- and that's about all I can say.

Plus... what the hell happened to  "" Parker"" from the first Red Faction...and where did that mad scientist with the experiments go?

Story? Bad. Love interest? Big yawn. Shooting and aim system? Terrible.

Too many negatives and not enough positives but at his price level, it may just be a game to mess around with when your extremely bored to the point where watching paint dry causes you to get popcorn and a soda.

EDITEDIT:  Patch 4 update 10/16/13 at bottom

It's been about a week, and I still don't feel I can fully put into words my complicated feelings about this game.

So much of it, for me, is a comparison with previous games.  Rome Total War was one of the best of the franchise, only superseded by Medieval II Total War, which was essentially the exact same game, but with more features and better graphics.

The best I can say for Rome 2 is that it's better than Empire Total War and Napoleon Total War, though that's not really saying much.

As well, it took this game for me to realize that, aside from Medieval II, Total War Shogun 2 was the best of the ""modern"" Total War games, with a truly engaging campaign map that was short and well-defined (25 years or so over 200 turns in the main game, 10 years over 200 turns in Fall of the Samurai) giving you plenty of time to work with your family members and agents and overall policy for your clan.  Battles were actually discernible and fun to watch, particularly as each individual unit seemed to be able to lock on to an enemy or two, with some groups getting into mini-duels with a single opponent, often to have one of their comrades step in and abruptly end it with a quick stab to the other duelist.  There was enough of an RPG element and a balance in AI (to some degree) so that you could predict which clans would behave stupidly, and which would maintain strong alliances.

Rome 2 doesn't deviate too far from this setup, and is much more like Shogun 2 than the original Rome Total War.  But something about it just doesn't work.

For one, there's the passage of time.  Shogun 2 worked because there was plenty of time to do stuff in a year's time in-game, so you could decide the fate of your clan within a period of just a year or two, or even draw out a war of attrition into something that could span a decade.  In Rome 2, each turn has 1 year pass.  Combining this with the incredibly slow movement of units on the campaign map, and you have a situation less like the first game and more similar to Medieval II's campaign map, where a journey which should take months ends up taking almost a decade or more.

Medieval II was trying to cram 500 years of Medieval history into a 200 turn game, and compensated by having the game mechanics operate on a 2 turns per year system (much like RTW).  This means that characters and agents aged at a rate of 6 months per turn, which could make it ridiculous to have a King reign for 200 years and only be 80 or so.  But in Rome 2, characters age with the turns, so the vast majority of your generals, admirals, named characters, and agents, will be well into their middle ages by the time they're accomplished generals, even if they are fighting in frequent wars.

Nothing in the game allows for this 1 turn per year to be even remotely realistic, and given that such an emphasis is now placed on generals (ie, you NEED a general or an admiral in order to lead armies) you may as well not even bother polishing and grooming them into being your game's Caesar or Alexander or Alcibiades, because they'll die of old age by the time they've got a full army and plenty of battle experience.

This effect was somewhat similar in Rome Total War (2turns per year), yet there you had the versatility of a Family Tree---it wouldn't be wise to focus on a single character, but you could polish and groom him and his children, and establish a veritable dynasty of men that you craft to be master generals or master administrators or master politicians, even going so far as to pass down ancillaries (like tutors, mentors, pet dogs, family heirlooms, custom armor, sacred artifacts) from generation to generation, and feel a genuine sense of loss if that family member dies without passing on the ancillaries.

In Rome 2, there's absolutely none of that.  No family tree, no valuable ancillaries you could risk losing, nothing particularly special other than the exact same trees of traits you can pick for characters that contribute virtually nothing to the character.  Whereas in Rome Total War, a character could have a foul temper, and have it affect his influence, or a mental illness which affects his troops' morale, in Rome 2, there's only room for 3 traits that come entirely at random, followed by skills that add to things like ""zeal"", ""authority"", and  which contribute little to nothing to the character at all, particularly since they die of old age so quickly.

The campaigns themselves are another disastrous mess...

One of my worries about modding the game (particularly to increase the number of turns per year) was the risk of too-fast growth and expansion.  For example, Medieval II Total War was designed to be 2 years per turn, and so the growth of cities reflects the sort of gradual growth that would span centuries, even if named characters live much longer than humanly possible.  No matter how fast you grew or conquered, you were unlikely to trigger such events as the discovery of Gunpowder or the recruiting of Plate-armored Knights by the 1100s, whereas if you decreased the years in each turn, you could see your nation conquer half of Europe with musketmen and cannons, and an expedition heading to America by 1200 AD.

Even in Rome Total War, whereas in real history, Rome expanded in fits and spurts, rapidly expanding during certain war periods, and remaining steady and consolidating their gains over decades, so that the breakdown of the Republic occurred by the 80s BC, in-game, you could easily consolidate your gains, and spark an End-Game situation as early as the 190s BC, and see Rome dominating everything west of Greece by 140s BC, facing off against the Seleucids or Egypt or Parthia dominating everything east of Greece.

Despite this, it appears my fears are somewhat unfounded in this game, not just due to the poor pacing and slow movement of everything, but due to two factors; AI passivity and the horrendous new Province/Settlement system.

The game AI is no better or worse than average for Total War, except that in the campaign map, everyone seems so idle and passive.  More than 100 turns into the game, no one has ever declared war on me out of the blue, and of the dozen or so factions that have been wiped out, more than half of them were wiped out by me and my expansion.  I feel that I could easily set this to last 500 turns, 4 turns per year, and little would change over the scope of the campaign without my interference.

This doesn't bother me -too- much, but this is a Total War game, not a Civilization game.  This is a problem of trying to fit so much history into a single campaign.  I feel that Medieval Total War did it best, by having three separate campaigns divided by era----early, high, and late.  Even Shogun 2 did it, albeit with DLC and expansion packs, between Rise of the Samurai in the 1170s AD, Sengoku Jidai in 1575-1600, and Fall of the Samurai in 1867-1877 AD.

I feel like if the game had divided into three different eras of Roman history, they could have contained as much as they wanted to in scope, while making the game much more of an aggressive ""Total War"" type game.

As for the Settlement/Province system...

Rome and Medieval II Total War let you build any type of building in any type of settlement, restricted only by population growth and city expansion---you couldn't build huge barracks and mansions in a village of 400 people, but if it grew to 25,000 you could.

By Empire and Napoleon Total War, settlements were reduced to a pre-determined size, with only 5-6 building slots, requiring you to diversify your regions, so one settlement would specialize in infantry, another in cavalry, another in artillery, another in farming, etcetera.  This continued into Shogun 2, with the added bonus of bringing back city expansion, opening up more slots for you to add to your settlements.

Rome 2 has the same thing, but has reduced it down to a sharp scale, to where most settlements will only be able to have 3 buildings, with other settlements able to expand to add another building slot with enough population growth, but there's no clear reason as to why some settlements can grow, and others mysteriously can't.

The map is divided into ""Provinces"" which consist of 2-5 individual settlements, all connected to one another based solely upon the arbitrary delineation of the game creators.  Whereas Athens and Sparta were so fundamentally different that they spoke different dialects of Greek almost unrecognizable to one another, they are lumped together into the province of Hellas for the sole convenience of distance, with the island of Crete added along because the game creators said so.

What this means is that each settlement in the province is linked together.  Whereas in previous games, unhappiness and squalor varied depending on individual cities, as is basic common sense, now it is distributed amongst the settlements, so if one settlement is rich and luxurious, and its neighbor is a slum-ridden wasteland, people will riot in the rich and luxurious settlement, because the game creators said so.

Speaking of unhappiness and squalor...

I really don't even need to say much, but for the sake of a review, I will.  Perhaps the primary cause of the aforementioned timid and passive AI is the ridiculous heaps of squalor from improving virtually every building.

Much of this system seems to borrow heavily from Civilization 5, which as I mentioned in my review of it, actually PUNISHES and PENALIZES you for EXPANDING and GROWING your empire.  It rewards stagnation and not building anything more than necessary to live.

Similarly here, all the basic buildings enable basic services (Farms produce food, field camps produce militia troops, consecrated sites provide order bonuses and culture spread, ports provide basic ships and trade), but the more you upgrade them, the more they penalize you in terms of squalor or food.

EVERY food building (farm, animal herds, fishing ports) will produce tremendous squalor as higher levels.  Squalor contributes DIRECTLY to unhappiness in this game, as opposed to being a percentage of unhappiness that would come together with all the other factors.

EVERY building that isn't food will consume large amounts of food to build, which in turn means you'll need more food buildings, or else you'll have starvation across provinces, which will lead to steep declines in happiness anyway.

So basically, you're PENALIZED for naturally growing and expanding.  Not rushing through anything (you need to research higher and higher level technologies to unlock certain buildings), not cheating to add tons of gold to build the higher level buildings quickly, not doing anything to exploit the in-game system; you are PENALIZED for ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME.

This causes madcap situations like having your lush, well-fed, barely-taxed home region fall into anarchy and rebellion while a region you are freshly conquering is happy and joyous because you've just started building and you've got your full armies stationed there.

Playing as Athens, I had secured all of Greece and Macedonia, made the lunge into Sicily and Italy, and was pacifying northern Italy, wiping out Rome, when suddenly I get the word that Hellas (Athens, Sparta, Hierapytna) was miserable, and public order was plummeting by the double digits.  Squalor?  Massive.  Build up farming and markets?  More squalor.  Build up a fishing port, a trading port, or a naval port?  More squalor.  A barracks to train soldiers?  More squalor.  A brand new plumbing system to help clean up squalor?  LESS FOOD.  How the hell do stone aqueducts cost FOOD?  They're made of STONE, not meat!

And there's no real explanation as to what actually affects public order in any real way.  Whereas in previous games, you could see each individual settlement information, see how religion/culture penalties stacked up with unhappiness over high taxes, stacked up with squalor and/or boredom or unrest over having an army occupy them, and understand why the settlement is in turmoil, and MOST OF ALL, know exactly what to do to alleviate it.

For example, you could check a settlement to see that squalor was contributing to 80% of the unhappiness, and the tax burden contributing to 30% (leading to a -10% public order rate), you would know to build buildings that dealt with squalor to attack the big problem first.

In Rome 2, you're informed of the benefits and problems caused by taxes, culture, etcetera, even from high slave populations, but a whole other variable is left there as a general ""Who the Hell Knows"" in the form of ""Provincial Instability""

What causes it?  Who the hell knows.  In the aforementioned situation, Hellas was built up, and well-fed, with taxes at their absolute lowest settings.  Provincial Instability combined with the massive Squalor and plunged Hellas' public order down more and more every single turn, until it revolted and was quickly put down.  From there, Provincial Instability briefly disappeared.  Meanwhile, most of my armies were in Italy, and Italy was at full 100% public order, with NO provincial instability despite being recently conquered, and virtually identical to Hellas in terms of building diversity.

Again and again throughout the campaign, ""Provincial Instability"" strikes provinces entirely at random, with no explanation as to what is causing it.  I can be completely at peace, with three client states under me, and plenty of food coming in, very low taxes, and coffers bursting with tens of thousands of talents of gold, and suddenly a region will stop growing due to low public order and eventually revolt unless I send one of my armies to boost the Military Presence score.

Speaking of military, the new system seems to go straight to Marian-era private armies, where generals recruit soldiers directly.  You need them to be in a certain settlement with the right barracks or workshops to get the better quality units and weapons, but ultimately you can't train a small task force to just hang around without appointing a general to it, and you can't leave a full stack of versatile heavy infantry to defend a border town; garrisons are automatically deployed when attacked, and you need a general-led army in town to add to the defense.

The new Unit Cards are also horribly done.  In every previous game up until Shogun 2, they used mini screenshots of the actual video game unit, as it appears on the field.  In Shogun 2, they went for stylized drawings of the units, or stylized pictures resembling daguerreotype photographs for Fall of the Samurai.

The drawings here are so cheap and lazy, it's almost impossible to tell the difference between certain units.  If it weren't for the names popping up when you hover over them, you'd barely even be able to tell the difference between Hastati and Principes, Hoplites and Pikemen and Thorax Pikemen, Javelinmen and Slingers (?!), and so on.  At some point, you don't even bother recognizing the units by name or armor/weapons, but by broad shapes in the UIs---you know this is a ballista because it looks like a bow, you know this is a cavalry trooper because it has a horse-looking thing in it, you know this is a higher-level legionary because the helmet is shaped differently.

The UI as well is an utter mess that hides valuable information in slide-up tabs that appear when you click on settlements or armies, and which hides the Event Log in a decision I cannot even imagine making any sort of sense at all.  You have to manually open the event log most of the time, only to find that it is unevenly spaced with the rest of the UI, causing it to take up a huge part of the screen.

Then there's agents.  Much like Shogun 2, they charge money to do their jobs that you hire them for to begin with, and by and large they're mostly useless, meant either to assassinate one another or give minor bonuses to your own army.

The last major issue with the campaign is the factions system.  I've only played as Athens thus far, so I can't speak for how well it works with divided nations like Rome and Carthage.  Much like Rome Total War, you play as families (properly named now, House of Julia, Junia, Cornelia) which end up controlling the entirety of Rome, so there aren't multiple Roman factions on the map, which is good, I suppose, and better represents the coming civil war.

But what I don't understand for Athens at least is the whole point of having factions which are apparently hostile to one another, and to which I am actively a member of one, along with controlling the entire nation of Athens.

Basically, there are ""Oligarchs"" and ""Magistrates"".  I didn't get to choose, I was automatically made a Magistrate.  I had to suffer the Oligarchs trying to assassinate my own generals and family members, sometimes succeeding, and my having absolutely no control over their actions, save to try to do the same to them.

Except, like I said before, I CONTROL ALL OF ATHENS.  Meaning I can appoint Oligarch faction members to the heads of armies.  Even armies only 100 men strong.  I can then send that tiny army straight into the Sahara desert and wait until they die of attrition, or the Numidians get sufficiently enraged by my trespassing that they attack and kill them.  Literally nothing stops me from doing this because there is no repercussion, no benefit, no sense that this factionalism is even affecting my campaign at all beyond aggravating me by having experienced generals suddenly drop dead or get put out of action for 5 years, wounded from a botched assassination attempt.

Now, to the battles.

In true ""vanilla"" Total War style, they are fast, wild, and typically over quickly.  Completely out of the norm for Total War style, units now don't even bother to stay in formation when fighting, opting instead to go Hollywood-style one-man-army Drunken Titus Pullo Breaking Rank And Forcing Lucius Vorenus To Have Him Whipped For Disobeying And Assaulting Him.  The worst part is, the Hoplites actually have a Phalanx formation, and can move in phalanx formation.  Though if I order them to run, they will immediately break Phalanx formation.  So I try to keep them walking.  They STILL break phalanx formation as soon as they reach the enemy line.

I've already seen the term ""Blob"" used to describe these battles in Rome 2, where units simply pile on to each other, with seeming disregard for physics, into massive balls.  I haven't seen it happen frequently, though that may just be because enemy units tend to rout quickly, long before I can pile in enough troops to make a blob.

Literally no previous Total War game from Rome to Shogun 2 has been this bad in terms of unit spacing and formation.  In all those games, units maintained formation as much as their discipline and training allowed, and if soldiers were standing side by side, filling a small area with their bodies, you could not cram in MORE soldiers to stand next to them like you can in this game.

Winding down with one of the major complaints, graphics.  It looks pretty, though the decision on coloring seems to be odd, depending largely on lighting.  Compared to Shogun 2, soldiers are in bright, bold colors, sometimes incongruent, looking like a line of ketchup and mustard bottles for a Roman line.

As well, the campaign map is massive, and apparently more detailed than Shogun 2.  I only assume so because, while Shogun 2's campaign map runs smoothly on my high-powered computer all the time, Rome 2's campaign map is constantly refreshing textures when I move the map around.  I can center in on Greece, move over to Italy, have Italy's textures appear flat and pixelated and quickly rebuff to their high quality settings, then scroll back to Greece and have its textures appear flat and pixelated as well, before rebuffing to high quality.  Aside from this, everything runs smoothly and quickly.

Except for loading times.

Even basic, small-scale battles take twice as long to load up as battles did in Shogun 2, despite there being no noticeable difference in memory or graphical strain on my system, and the dreaded End Turn can take as long as 2 minutes, even early into the game.  It makes it impossible to become immersed in the campaign gameplay, as each turn wastes away, with bogged down End Turn times forcing you to either watch the computer units meander about aimlessly, or find something to distract you until it's your turn again.

Another review of the game by Rowan Kaiser from ArsTechnica perfectly sums up this experience:

""In most grand strategy games, the motivation to play ""just one more turn"" is the most appealing part. In Total War: Rome II, ""just one more turn"" is a threat.""

****PATCH 4 UPDATE****

I hadn't touched the game since October 6th, but boredom overcame, and so I looked to finish my grueling Athenian campaign, currently post-turn 300 because the victory conditions are obscenely long, and by which standards even the Roman Empire wouldn't reach (I currently control about as much land, if not more than Rome at its height, which consists of some 120 settlements, when I need 140 for victory.  Alternately, I need 90 settlements and 20 trade agreements for an economic victory, but GOOD LUCK GETTING 20 TRADE PARTNERS THIS LATE IN THE GAME).

Basically, the only changes I've noticed are cosmetic.  The biggest change from Patch 1 was that the End Turn time was sharply reduced, and loading times between battles or loading saves is similarly reduced.  Some icons were fixed, or expanded upon to provide better information, and naval units now have symbols representing their upgraded hulls.

Despite the reportedly hundreds of changes made, my earlier statement (and the title of my Civ5 review) still rings true for this game---shiny new expansions and patches can't fix a rotten foundation.

- If there were ANY improvements to AI, I haven't seen them yet, or I may have to start up a whole new campaign, because the Campaign AI is essentially DOA---literally no faction declares war on me, the player, and they are ALWAYS begging for money in exchange for meaningless Non-Aggression Pacts (meaningless because they never declare war on me anyway), or trade agreements they break off turns later due to losing their trading port, or a general hissy fit.  Similarly, they seem completely, blissfully ignorant of your or any other AI's movements.

It seemingly makes sense for the player character to not be able to see the entirety of the map right away (it would cause utter hell on End Turn times, as well), but a staple of the series has tended to be that AI would recognize when their borders were weak; it would build up armies or keep them close by to borders with other factions.  This is given even MORE opportunity in Rome 2 by allowing you to walk through other nations' lands without having to declare war or seek military access, though by doing so you anger the nation and risk provoking conflict.

But since the AI never declares war on you, you're free to squat 6 armies on top of an enemy city and watch as they mewl and do nothing.  They don't even bring up their own armies to try to passive-aggressively urge you to leave.  As such, if you're planning to take over every settlement owned by a faction, you can freely move your armies into position to blitz them within 1 turn, and the AI won't do a thing to stop you, or even pretend to be concerned.

Yet by the same (lack of) logic, the AI will break off trade agreements with you if they feel you're getting too rich or too close to economic victory.

- Battle AI.  I firmly believe that so long as those EFFing flags are there, the battle AI will remain fundamentally broken at the basest level.  In prior games, siege battles had a ""flag"" in the form of a town square, but the AI was seemingly more focused upon actually fighting out a battle---their main force would besiege, attack your defending forces, then if they had backup or reinforcements on the other side of the settlement, would slip in from the rear and take the town square WHILE KEEPING your forces occupied.

Instead in this game, practically the exact opposite happens; the force deployed to attack your defense forces will SIT and WAIT for their ""secret reserves"" to slip in and snatch the town square, allowing you full momentum to bring virtually your entire army to smash that backup force, then sit and wait for 50 minutes as the enemy besiegers stand there and wait for the now-destroyed force to steal the victory for them.  Most of the time, they will send a few siege engines to at least try to attack your forces, but if the first wave fails, they don't even bother trying again.  And this is a NEW PROBLEM---enemies would ALWAYS attack in siege battles for as long as they had siege equipment!  The battle would automatically end in victory for you if the enemy's siege towers and/or battering rams were set on fire and destroyed; it even encouraged the AI to build more ladders, since they could never be destroyed.

But since only settlement capitals have walls now, the vast majority of siege battles are essentially village defenses like in prior games where your settlement didn't even have a basic wooden palisade up.  Here, the enemy AI is entirely fixated on that EFFing flag.  Every single siege defense battle I have played, from day 1, to patch 4, has consisted of the enemy rushing ALL their troops forward against one of my lines, throwing ALL their infantry and cavalry into my units, IGNORING THEM, and trying to rush PAST them to get to my EFFing flag.  This has caused victories which saw my garrison forces of less than 1000 win heroic victories against enemy forces 4 and 5 times larger, simply because the enemy ran into my spears, and kept trying to run, rather than bothering to stop and fight.

All these factors coming together, combined with the release-day bugs, the reportedly 40% larger (than any prior TW game) budget, and the breath-taking arrogance from the marketing side, makes this whole game, even now more than a month after release and 4 patches adding up to hundreds of megabytes of more data, an unmitigated failure of game play design.",negative

409,"Due to Madden Football's strong following they think they can take advantage of us by putting out subpar games at top notch prices. Personally, I'm getting tired of this. This game use to be great! Now... for the last two years it has been terrible at least compared to the years between 2002 to 2005. I was hoping EA wouldnt start cutting corners once they got that exclusive deal with the NFL. I thought they were better than that. I guess I was wrong. I didn't buy this game this year however I borrowed it. If this or the 2006 version is the first madden you have played, you'll probably love it, however, if you remember the top notch games of the past, you'll be disappointed. This is a watered down version of past titles that has good graphics.... nothing more. I won't buy another until they up their standards again.

Cons:
1. No fantasy Draft (You can't make up your own team)
2. I have experienced this game freezing up on me numerous times before finishing a game... very frustrating.
3. During franchise mode, the draft and signing of free agents is hard to follow and poorly done which takes away from the overall franchise experience.
4. You still can't change individual defensive players assignments. For example in the past you could change each defensive player on the field to blitz, play deep zone, cover the flat, or quaterback sneak. Not being able to do this takes away from being creative defensively. You have to just run the play as is. You can still do things such as spread out the line, move all LBs and change cornerback coverage but it still isn't the same... not as good.
5. During Superstar mode, sometimes the camera angles doesnt allow you to see enough of the field to do what you need to do to be successful.
6. The game play, how the players move, still isn't as good as it was on the old XBOX. This is suppose to be a next generation system/game.... that doesnt make sense. Its better than last year though.
7. Madden still doesnt exist. How can you take Madden out of Madden football?.. that doesnt make sense. Instead of listening to madden, you have to listen to boring repetitve radio announcers.
8. They again changed what buttons do. Why do they have to keep changing what every button does? Keep the sprint button the same each year, keep how to do the hot routes the same each year!!! I have to relearn how to play the game each year because they change the buttons.... its annoying. Its not like they added anything over the years in order to have to change buttons... they took stuff away for crying out loud.
9. There are other things about the game I do not like, however, the above things are the most important. I'm sure you can find your own problems especially if you are not new to Madden Football.

Pros
1. Sad to say the pros of this game really aren't pros at all. For example, the ""new"" superstar mode really isn't new. Its been on the old XBOX version for two years now. Its only new to this system because they stripped it from last year's base title.
2. This is an improvement over last years title in regards to game play. The players do move better and quicker. Last years title was way too slow especially running.
3. Of course getting the update rosters and new hot rookies is a plus. This is probably the main reason people will end up buying this game any ways regardless of how subpar it is. (I won't though)
4. Nice graphics. To tell you the truth, compared to the old title, this is the only thing the newer version does better. In all other categories, this title lacks.

Bottom line: Its sad I have to get out my old XBOX to play a really good football game. This is an improvement over last years game however that isn't saying much.... last year was that bad. This still isn't worth even close to 60 dollars. I guess you all can see that by looking at the 30 dollar used copies. In the past there is no way this would be selling this cheap so quickly. Come on EA... Lets do better than this.",positive
410,"EA virtually has a monoply on sports games. EA Sports games are great, but there is almost no customer support. My three grown children and I all live in different cities, spread out over two states. We regularly purchase EA games to play together over our Xbox. EA Games discontinued the server for their older games. They say on their web site that it was a difficult decision and that 99% of their customers play the new games, so they could no longer afford the maintenance to support the 1% of their customers who play the older games. That I understand, but they have already discontinued some of their 2011 games, even before the year is over.  They are still selling games that they have already stopped the support on before the game is even purchased. What it boils down to is a subscription service for their games. You have to pay a monthly fee for the XBox, then you have to annually upgrade your games. If you play several different games and have four people in your family, that is a lot of money.

Now on to the game itself.
The game is actually quite good.  It's very charming and a lot of fun.  The variety of games, the online aspect, and creature creation tools are very well done and there is a lot of attention to detail in all aspects such as graphics, animation, sounds.  The game play unfortunately is a bit too simplistic and that hurts it after a few runs.  It left me pining for something with more depth.  The designers chose a trade-off between offering more variety at the cost of depth.  I suspect they also wanted to make the game more accessible for people who are not what I would term hard core gamers (and that's totally cool).

As a game it's a solid 3.5 stars.  As a product it should get 0 stars.  If EA wants to employ draconian copy protection measures; they're really there to prevent you from reselling the game, the should give their customers full disclosure.  In my opinion this is not how an ethical company should do business.  Thumbs down to EA for a horrible product, good job to will wrights crew for making a charming, albeit simplistic game.",neutral

My kids liked the Version 1 release (it's just called Pet Vet), but they disliked this Version 2 release (called Pet Vet 2: Healing Hands).  Why?

It's not the hardware -- they're running on a fast 2.6Ghz Pentium 4 laptop with 512MB RAM and plenty of disk space.

My advice is simple:  try the preview version by downloading from the the Internet (not from the Valusoft website -- strangely, they don't offer the download for Version 2, just Version 1), and if you like, then pull the trigger and buy the game (from Amazon -- it's cheaper than from ValuSoft directly).

Why did Nintendo make this for the Wii U is beyond me. There is zero logic. I bought the game to watch on my tv. I can't do it! Impossible! They should have made this for their handheld system.

Another problem? The big Wii U controller. Controlling Kirby is just a little uncomfortable. I can't imagine kids playing this. They will rage quit. It really should have been a 3ds game.",positive
424,"I can't stand the Final Fantasy franchise.  It's as simple as that.  The game is boringly repetitive to me, and you have to constantly grind, and grind.....and GRIND.  Can't STAND that!

This game is also excessively long.  I got up to the Spectral Keeper boss and just threw in the towel.  Walkthroughs wouldn't help either, and I absolutely refuse to waste my time doing hundreds of other battles in order to build up my stats.  That's not my style of video gaming, and when you play a video game, it is not meant to be a chore.  It is meant to be entertaining, visually appealing, have a great storyline, and be of medium/average difficulty.

It's pathetic how it took me over 20 years to play my first Final Fantasy game, and clearly, there was a reason for the long wait.  I should have never even made the attempt to play it in the first place.  Final Fantasy X was my first, and last, Final Fantasy game.  This one is on the top of my trade-in list.",negative
425,"Was waiting for this mouse anxiously because my Razer Taipan was spoilt and Razer ask me to pay for shipping back to USA  in order to RMA.

Took me 20 minutes of reinstalling synapse 2.0 and 3.0 and uninstall the mouse and repeat everything all over again to realise that the mouse does not work on wooden surfaces.

I would understand if the mouse doesn't work on glass surface but wooden surface?!?! This is really a bummer and I probably have to pay expensive shipping fees to get my refund which is totally not worth it. I have used Razer mouses since 2007 with more than 5 different mouses CopperHead, Diamondback, Lachesis, Taipan, Taipan (again), DeathAdder(this), but this will be my LAST razer mouse for sure.

-The fighting (became trite)

-Special effects (weren't good)

-Story line (cliched)

-Voices (horrendously inane)

-Graphics (nice, but the comic-book drawings were kind of dumb)

Methinks that what I hate about the game is excatly what people love about it.  I lost the game so I didn't try finishing it, which doesn't really bother me.  I suggest renting the game before buying.  That will save you money--or it would have for me anyway.",positive
433,"Install went okay...

Click to play, configuration tool crashes over and over - BAD.

/figure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a 2ndary launcher inbeded in the program files. /successfully launched skipping the configuration tool.

So that was frustrating.

Gameplay - BAD

First issue, Crashes caused by conversations with npcs, which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end, when it first happen windows gave a solution of a Mass Effect 1 Patch - which was easy enough to download and install but DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE...  Its completely RANDOM when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it, sometimes not.  LOL it literally says ""file not found"" and crashes, restart and Presto it works VERY RANDOM but must of restarted me 12+ times.  SAVE before EACH and Every NPC you talk to - to limit annoyance.

Cover system made of fail - pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward, and bad angles.

Item Cap of 150 /fail *blinks* if your already allowing me to carry around 100+items why the heck is there a cap at all?  And sorting the inventory out was a pain.  Games in general need to stop adding Caps like this, FF7 was great and you could hold 99 of everything.

Actual fighting/gameplay a form of torture clunky, clunky, CLUNKY - don't bother with cover its useless.

Land Rover - giggity, whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it.  Its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it, getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down IS NOT FUN.  Which brings me to another point, whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on EVERY planet.  It was INCREDIBLY unfun having to explore with the rover, when it bounces around like a weightless rag-doll on every little bump and don't have enough power to climb a hill.

Elevators - HORRIBLE you'll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides THAT ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN THE GAME.......
its actually a ""thank god"" moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game YEAH ITS THAT BAD... 3-5 minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so FREQUENT.

Sniper rifle wobble - Shepard on some kind of drug?  is he/she not a trained soldier?  Why can't he hold it still?  Even when you get the ability to add 2 25% weapon stability upgrades it's shake is pretty bad...  I'll never understand what was going through their head on this one.  As a amateur hunter i don't have any issue with shaking my gun like I'm hopped up on sugar pops OR WORST...

Story - Wasn't bad.

i think i might of liked it better than Me2, at least the end bad guy wasn't a ridiculous ""HUMAN REAPER"" oh noes!  - why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity.  Which truth be told this series lacks in spades.

Generally Clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersion.

Take note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous length.

It did some things better than Me2

For example every star system you go to has ""something"" to do in it.  But that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets with.

No Ammo was a cool idea, only overheating.

Ability to Sell stuff for Credits - this is good, but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying, and the 150 item cap drove me insane. - I ended with 9,999,999 (max) useless credits.

overall if i would of played this before Me2 i wouldn't of bought Me2 cus the genre would be dead to me.  Me2 is at least playable.  This is borderline unplayable, i managed to get through it by jamming to music in the background and reminding myself of the bigger picture Me2/Me3...",negative

438,"Shellshock 2: Blood Trails is a first person shooter for the xbox 360, ps3, and pc. Blood Trails is not a direct sequel to Shellshock Nam 67', the title may suggest it but the two are very different. Blood Trails moves the franchise to the survival horror niche, which again is very different from the gritty warfare of the original. Sadly, Blood Trails rubs off as rushed, and poorly executed.

Very rarely do I pick up a title for cheap, and feel I got more from the instruction booklet then the actual game (in this case I picked the game up for 4.99$). So much of the game is a letdown, tank controls (sluggish beyond reasoning), a story that's as random as an ink blot test, and of course the inability to live up to the previous title which was even met with mediocre warm views. I tend not to bash games without a good reason, and I hope people understand I do not mindlessly hate on this title. A next generation title that makes you question the year in which it was made by the performance (or therefore lack of) is not a good way to start.

The plot was a bit rough to digest, between the main character you play as Private Nate Walker and his Sergeants actions to secure your willingness to fight against the unknown. Your brother has information worthwhile to the U.S. about some cargo dubbed `Whiteknight', you are sent forth to extract said info. During the course of the game you are faced with supposed horror (which to me the only horror comes from the difficult maneuvers due to the controls). The game takes place during the conflict in Vietnam, with the finale resulting in a coin toss with two separate endings, based on the players' choice.

The game leaves you wanting something else to fill the void of your purchase, as the game is rather short if you do manage to complete it. There is no multiplayer to speak of, raising or lowering the difficulty of the campaign doesn't add much to the experience, not even the 360's version with `achievements' help lengthen the game. I've spotted random enemies `respawning' before my eyes, frame rate drops, rough graphics that seem even more dated then the previous title, and a color palette consisting of brown, grey, green, and red, with of course an unhealthy amount of black (even when tinkering with the brightness setting things become either too dark to spot enemies, or too washed out to see straight).

Levels aren't exactly linear in a sense, the player can explore areas, but often times this turns into a state of confusion as much can be skipped with little to no consequences. Engaging the enemy can become a nightmare if your brightness setting isn't adjusted just right (as mentioned above). Even with the brightness accordingly set, I still find myself tossing of grenades, and wondering what happened to my inventory. You don't automatically collect ammo, you'll have to go over to a weapon and collect it yourself. Guns fire closer to bb or pellet guns than an almighty deafening rifle. In case I wasn't clear, sound quality is lacking.

The original Shellshock though poorly received still had a reasonable following, for the simple reason it was believable, lengthy, and had a lot to come back to with collectibles. Shellshock: Blood Trails feels like an attempt to demo a handheld game for a home console. Shame too, I was really interested in the future of this series. If I was asked to point out the good, I'd have to say the game makes for a good venting session when explaining your grief to friends after playing this.",negative

443,"WWE 2K16 has tons of fluff, options, and settings, but the core gameplay system is a compete displeasure at every turn.  They've taken the skeleton of the much more fun and fast-paced arcade games like Smackdown: HCTP & others which were made YEARS AND YEARS ago and unsuccessfully tried to slow them down and feel more like a simulation game.  It fails at both, and is a terrible Frankensteined in-between system that is just awful.

They're too cheap and lazy to start over with a truly original set of mechanics and animations.  The hit detection is a joke, everyone just floats around in a sludge-like manner.  You don't feel like you are controlling your character and actually wrestling, as much as just executing a set of poor animations.

The stamina system is pretty silly.  You can be dominating a match, but then have to watch your character go through a ridiculous heavy-breathing animation that locks you out of control until their stamina refills.  Often times your opponent, who you just performed a move on, recovers before you do.  Unless of course, you do boring and poorly animated ""resting"" submission holds.  Speaking of which, he submission system in this game is broken, all the way.

So many aspects of this game are tied to ridiculous looking pop-up mini-games and quick-time button presses that don't even make sense with the slowed down ""sim"" feel they are trying to go for.  It's high time the developers made brand new set of animations & mechanics for these games.  If they want to rip off past games, please take from the much better AKI engine games like No Mercy.

You may still find so enjoyment of this game, but I highly recommend not pay more than $35 for it, especially since a lot of content is locked behind the DLC ""season pass"" that they want you to shell out even more money for.",negative

I loved Bioshock. Bioshock 2 is not worth the money. After 2 days of trying to get this game to run I have given up the ghost.

448,"So Blizzard knows that three million or so customers are going to try and login at launch...a huge launch that Blizzard has been promoting for months. And yet the auth/login servers are crashed or too busy.

The previous Diablo games had offline + LAN play to complement Battlenet play. Blizzard, in their infinite wisdom, decided to remove both LAN as well as offline play. So instead of a majority of customers who bought the game getting to play it after installing/unlocking, and waiting patiently to play on Battlenet with friends later when login issues are resolved, no one gets to play.

I get it that the auction house will revolve around real-world money, and Blizzard wants to have complete control over that, which means forcing everyone to be constantly connected. But in previous Diablo games, our LAN and single-player offline characters were stored locally (on the computer you played the game from), while our Battlenet characters were stored server-side. This allowed LAN/offline players to use mods as well as character editors, but protected the 'official' Battlenet multiplayer community by keeping them separate.

I can only give this game 1 star because you have to give it at least one. Even when the login servers are fixed, no one will be able to play offline, nor over a local network with a group of friends unless they have an internet connection.

Built well.
Holds controllers nicely

Charging these battery packs take forever. It is much better to buy a $14 Rechargeable Energizer AA battery and wall charger combo, and a extra set of 4qty AA rechargeable battery's ($8). The charge lasts so much longer and you never have to wait for a controller to charge.
The other issue was sometimes the battery packs didn't charge at all. Almost like the connection wasn't good enough for it to take charge or something. The battery packs never went in either of my controllers tightly. The tops seam to stick out just a bit and never really lock in well.

I bought a $13 shipped PS4 charger like this from the CEstore (I believe) and I have to say I like that charger better in every way. I expected more from Energizer. I can't recommend this product, I think you can do better with your money going several different directions.

The number one problem that totally annihilated this game is the need for a persistent internet connection to play the single player campaign!  This makes absolutely no sense.  This means that, for those with a shaky internet connection, you will get booted out of the game with no ability to save your progress!  Furthermore, there is no real base building (you have a crawler that you basically take with you and unpack where you want).  No resource gathering (you have what are essentially action points that enable you to build a certain number of units).

Where to begin
the game took everything that made Diablo II LoD good, and threw it all out in the trash and kept everything that made the game boring.
then
they added an RMAH/AH to make sure that you don't find any of your own gear (the entire point of the game was supposed to be leveling up skills and finding your own gear to make your skills more powerful, ie +1 to all skills) , but no they even removed that ""feature"" you can't level spells and abilities up, every spell you get is as powerful as its ever going to be (no room for improvement), your skills don't even matter, since everything is based off Main-Stat and Weapon Damage, the only reason to change spells is because you don't like the animation or appearance of a spell, since the spells effects are meaningless (they don't do anything but do damage); so all the spells feel bland/feel the same./pointless you could equip ""throw squirel"" and it would do same damage as ""Fire Beam"".

The wizard is a joke, Teleport is horrible.

In Short, if you were a fan of the past 3 Diablo releases (1 2 lod) you will probably be disappointed with this release, hold off till Diablo 4 or to see if they bring the game back in line with its roots in an expansion.

Update:
After charging the Vita for the first time, I noticed that the charging cable fits really tight into the vita, it was difficult to remove, and using this charger makes the vita touch screen stop working when waking the device, you have to unplug the charger and reboot the system.

Further Update: The problem with the touch screen not working seems to be due to the adapter, not the cable, when using the cable with an official charger for either the Vita or the PSP Go it works fine, you just have to deal with the extremely tight fitting connector.

The quality of the graphics is OK (approximately the same as FM2), and the physics model is slightly different from FM2 (not better, just different).

If you already have (the heavily-flawed but much cheaper) FM2, there is no reason to buy this game.

474,"When the orginal Guitar Hero came out, that was one of the few games I really wanted for the PS2, which I did not have at the time. One of my friends got it, and I immediately fell in love. As a guitarist myself, I was really happy to see that people could play a rhythm-based game with rock music, as opposed to Dance Dance Revolution (which has primarily techno and dance music). Guitar Hero II came out first for the PS2, and later for the Xbox 360, with more songs, and downloadable content. With its added co-op and pro face-off two-player features, and an improved hammer-on/pull-off system, Guuitar Hero II is one of my favorite games on the 360. When it was announced that Neversoft was going to take Harmonix's place for the next Guitar Hero installment, I didn't know what to think. Screenshots for Guitar Hero 3 started circulating around the internet, I was both intrigued and disappointed. Intrigued by the new look and feel of the game, but disappointed that Neversoft was too stuck-up to keep the original design. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" must not be something heard around Neversoft's head honchos.
I have to say, playing GH3 for the first time, it was fun. As much fun as playing either of the other Guitar Hero games. That is, until I found what all was different. If you are allowed to either hammer-on or pull-off to the next note, you don't have to time it at all, which doesn't even make sense. One major problem I find with the game, is the fact that Neversoft decided that expert difficulty is going to be harder than anything else. How? By making any audible guitar noise a ""note,"" and the influx of three-note chords. Of course, that's the only way to make some of the songs challenging, seeing as every single song (except the battles) were singles at some point. Why is this bad? Because instead of choosing a song that would be good for Guitar Hero, a more popular song was chosen (specifically Miss Murder, Paint it Black, When You Were Young, and My Name is Jonas).
As for the guitar controller, Neversoft decided it would be for the best if the guitar had a detacheable neck. As for why, the only reason I can think of is for easy transport. But if you take the neck off, that's just one more thing to carry, and the neck doesn't stay in the body snugly, it jiggles around, ruining any long note you hit. The guitar I received has a jiggly neck, messed-up star power, and a slightly broken whammy bar. Star power is completely messed up. Sometimes it'll activate if I turn the guitar in any direction, and sometimes it won't activate unless I swing the guitar around like a maniac. Normally, I press the Back button, but even that doesn't work! As for the whammy bar, there's a ""dead spot"" in the middle position where it doesn't register, so I have to pump the whammy bar all the way down and all the way back for it to work.
Specifically for 360 owners, the achievements are ludicrous. They expect some kind of being with super-human Guitar Hero-playing powers to be playing GH3, because those are the only things that'll be getting the crazy achievements, such as beating Through the Fire and Flames on expert, using star power three times on TtFaF on expert, gold star (get 100 percent on) 20 songs on expert, and buying everything from the shop, which requires getting five stars on all songs on all four difficulties. Neversoft has completely ruined Guitar Hero for me, and I will be buying Rock Band 2 when it comes out instead of Guitar Hero: World Tour. Neversoft has completely ruined Guitar Hero for me",positive

481,"I don't know what came upon Sega when they made this so-called ""game"" (I normally refer to it as digital vomit). When you hear Sonic, you normally think ""Oh yeah, that faster-then-sound hedgehog who founded gaming with super-fast paced action!"". Sonic Labyrinth is not any of that. Instead of the ""super-fast paced action"" you get a slow and tedious maze to explore on a time limit (and not the 10 minutes you get in the normal games). When I say slow I don't mean long or boring, I mean Sonic moves slower then Mario, and that is saying something. It wasn't an accidental bug or hardware issues either. It was meant to be. If you don't mind watching your favorite hedgehog crawl around the areas, you will probably mind the other diasters. Music? Makes Atari 2600 numbers sound good. Graphics? Makes Pong look incredible. Gameplay? I would rather play Mario's Time Machine for a week then this for 60 seconds.

Simple, same as Diablo 3, a server connection is always needed but so many people are playing at the same time that you are disconnected. I do not even do multiplayer online, don't have time for a crowd to join but I must stay online, fine I do and it still drops me. Before it was just perfect if you had to keep your game disk in and Blizzard would play for you knowing you could not copy their media at all. And I do have disks for this game which I purchased from Newegg or Amazon, don't remember which but I must quit after so many times I get disconnected. NOOOO, my internet service is on, I can go Ebay too and I am writing this on Amazon as soon as I got dumped by Blizzard server. This is exactly why I stopped playing Diablo 3.

Second, they're a pain in the butt to switch out if you change from say golf to tennis.  They do nothing to enhance the playability of the game,  On the contrary, they can get in the way, especially if the play area is a bit small.

487,"I loved gears 1 online although I was not a huge fan of the story, although I doubt anyone was because they purposly made the dialogue like a cheesy scifi.  But the greatest part of it was bring guest online and playing with your friends.  As is such the appeal of halo.  I was really looking forward to going home opening up and playing with my friend who has waited in line with me for 2 hours.  I logged online and spent 10 minutes trying to find how to log a guest in till I realized they had not included that feature in gears 2.  In my opinion the worste mistake they could have possibly made.  Not only that, but they have also made several key tweaks to the weapons that add up to make mediocre online play.  For example the smoke grenade now stuns.  Considering every player in the game starts off with one of these it makes it impossible to hold cover.  It has already become quiet common for a gun battle to just turn into an exchange of smoke grenades.  Also they have make it so you can turn frag grenades into a sort of makeshift mine.  Naturally players are just standing on the frag grenades waiting for them to repop so they can put them in your spawn.  They have also added a pointless ability to crawl while you are down.  This is not only pointless its humiliating.  Dont be mistaken, their is not escaping when you are down.  It just makes it funner to humiliate you for the other team.  Another wonderful addition is the shotgun is now even MORE powerful.  Although they have managed to make it possible to keep them at bay from a range.  Close range the shotgun is now extremely powerful and accurate.  It is not at all uncommon to be eliminated by the first shot, which pairs just wonderfully with the smoke grenade stun.  The game has just turned into a race for who can through a smoke grenade faster.  Another huge dissapointment is the game types promised and maps.  The new game types simply don't offer the excitement that simple execution and warzone provided in gears one, and the maps often foster overuse of smoke grenades and frag mines. I can say though the roadie run and cover system has improved vastly.  The campaigne play is much funner, and the story is much more involving.  But as a person who would only by a game for only play I am extremely dissapointed.  Between no longer playing with guest, a very unbalanced play style, and not delivering on new game types, my worste fears of come true.  After months and months of waiting Gears of war 2......

494,"I'll keep this short.  I'm a big fan of the first two Max Paynes and was more than willing to give this one a try inspite of Sam Lake or Remedy having nothing to do with it... big mistake.  This game is simply awful for so many reasons I can't even begin to describe.  Forget glitches or console limitations alltogether, let's talk about the game itself.

1. The storyline is incredibly weak.  There are very very few moments when the dialogue and the story will pique your interest and anyone can see the plot twists coming a mile away.  Also, while I don't have any issues with cutscene lengths, the periodic ""word emphasis"" pop ups that persist throughout each cutscene are juevenile and annoying as hell.

2. Difficulty.  I've been playing this game through on the Hard difficulty setting and the continuous cheap deaths and scene startovers are so abundant that I have actually found myself getting angry at this stupid game rather than enjoying it or being challenged by it.  I'm nearly finished with it and I have a sneaking suspicion that all I have to look forward to after beating it as a reward will be unlocking even more difficult (if that's even possible) play settings.  Seriously, I know for a fact that if this game is any harder on more difficult settings that there is NO WAY that play testers or this game's designers have successfully played through it, and if so, then I promise they didn't enjoy it, which is really the point of a video game, entertainment and fun.  Max Payne 3 has neither of these.

Max Payne 3 pretty much fails on every level of what a good video game should be.  It isn't fun, has zero replay value, the graphics are only standard for current gen games, the storyline is mediocre at best.  Rock Star should be ashamed at putting out a product like this.  Following Red Dead Redemption, I counted Rock Star games as a reliable source for quality.  No longer.

All I could think was ""Oh NO, please don't let this last long""....No way was I going to continue that for any great length of time.  SO when I checked reviews, I found out that much of the game does indeed use the golf cart and then a boat...Yikes.  While Kapu Cave was short, and rather tedious with repetitive seashell hunting, this game comes 1st for the worst, with KC coming 2nd.  I hope HerInteractive's next adventure has some mystery to it and FUN.  I don't enjoy games that require a total walk-through and having to look up sequences to avoid running around in circles.

It got more then it deserves - way more. Between the DRM which is an awful idea and this, it's over the top.

I'm 6 hours into attempting to install it and it still fails. It's all over the Internet now. The game shipped with a faulty installer. BioWare has provided instructions on how to install it manually from the DVD. Don't get your hopes up. About 20 of the files in the myriad of RAR files come up corrupt as you unpack them. You have to go in and verify and extract them manually. After all of that, NO GO. It launches and stops with a missng file message. It's a MESS EFFECT.

If BioWare and EA had spent as much time on quality control as they spent in implementing DRM, I'm sure everything would have been fine. Thanks a bunch guys. You have managed to piss off a cash paying customer. I won't be purchasing anything else from you again. No wonder the % of games being pirated keeps geting higher.

522,"You know, I have been a huge Sonic fan for as long as I can remember, right down to the Genesis days.  I know that the 3D Sonic games tend to have a polarizing reputation, but in all honesty, I liked most of his 3D outings, with the only two exceptions being the SD version of Unleashed, which wasn't bad by any means, but I preferred the HD version (which I am going to discuss later on), and THIS!  Okay, so the gist is that Sega had to rush the game into stores in order to meet the 15th anniversary deadline so they could remain financially stable, and it really shows.  One the one hand, I do admire how it tries to recapture the ambition of the Adventure duology & Shadow the Hedgehog, but when it misses, it really misses.  First, let's look at the story.  Sonic decided to go on a vacation in Soleanna, the City of Water, where they are celebrating the Festival of the Sun.  Just as when its princess, Elise, lit the giant torch in the center of the city, Dr. Eggman with a new and pretty odd appearance, arrives and captures Elise to seek the Flames of Disaster, despite Sonic's best efforts to save her, but she gives him the blue Chaos Emerald.  So, Sonic teams up with Tails and Knuckles to rescue Elise, investigate the mystery of the Flames of Disaster Eggman mentioned, rinse and repeat about six times, and there you have Sonic's story.  Shadow's story is that he and Omega broke into Eggman's base to rescue Rouge and retrieve the Scepter of Darkness.  However, at the rondevux point, Eggman knocks the scepter out of Rouge's hands and causes it to shatter, freeing an entity known as Mephiles who took on Shadow's appearance as he was the one who sealed him inside ten years before using time travel.  There is also the newcomer, Silver, who came from a future devastated by Iblis and enlisted the help of Blaze from Sonic Rush, who possibly warped there and lost her memory for some reason.  Since Iblis keeps healing despite their best efforts to take it down, they run into Mephiles who uses Chaos Control for them to travel back in time in order to kill Sonic, who Mephiles prophecised to be the so-called ""Iblis Trigger"", and it becomes one big, convoluted, contradictory, stupid, melodramatic, & plot hole-laced adventure with a revolting love story between Sonic & Elise for good measure.  Wrap your head around that.  In addition to the 4kids voice cast, there was also Lost in Space survivor Lacey Chabert as the voice of Elise, who also made a guest appearance in the Black Christmas remake the exact same year.  To be fair, Chabert's voice in general can be annoying at times, but she at least tries acting-wise.  She, along with Mike Pollock as Eggman & Dan Green as Mephiles, were the three best voice actors in this game.  Everyone else's talents were wasted by the material they had to work with.  As far as the gameplay is concerned, I do admire how it tries to recapture what made Adventure 1 & 2's gameplay so special to me and try not to make the same mistake Heroes made in having the playable characters, stages, and bosses virtually the same; and the music is pretty cool.  However, it was bogged down by some fatal flaws.

1. It suffers from the exact same problem as Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly which I reviewed two years ago.  A lot of the glitches can be game-breaking and they have become the butt of a joke on Youtube, right down to Knuckles & Rouge getting stuck to the wall on occasion, characters running off loop-de-loops and falling to their deaths, etc.

2. What is up with the excessive load screens?  One way I can sum them up is talk to somebody, load screen, they tell you the objective, load screen, you do the mission, load screen, they congratulate you on a job well done, results, ANOTHER LOAD SCREEN!  Trust me.  Extensive loading can leave some people bored out of their minds, especially when you take into account of how tedious the side missions can be for some reason.

3.  Some of the character bosses can be pretty cheap, such as Silver when he constantly throws you at nearby walls using telekinesis without giving you any time to react while shouting ""It's no use"" over and over again.  The same can go for the opposite side of the spectrum when you play as Silver and you can just throw items and debris at Sonic & Shadow, and you win, kind of like in the horrible Karate Kid 3 when Daniel threw one punch at Mike Barnes and he won the fight.  At least the character battles in Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 were fair.  To be fair, the remaining bosses at least had more emphasis on strategy than the ""attack repeatedly"" no-brainer ones from Heroes, but still could have used some extra work.

4. Despite being able to roam around freely and it is not on-rails, the controls were mind-blowingly awful.  It doesn't look bad when you watch gameplay videos, but trust me, it's bad.  A lot of the characters' maneuvering felt way more slippery, clunky, and sensitive than other 3D Sonic games combined and the attacks felt so awkward and stiff that I usually get hit first.  It is hard to do controls justice and that, along with the ""where the *@&+ do I go"" level design, cheap obstacles, etc., is what killed the game for me, so the true way to know is to play it yourself, and to quote Chris McCleen from Total Drama Island, I triple dog dare you.

There are more reasons why this game became the Sonic series' crowning achievement of failure, but this review was getting long as is.  If you want to know every single solitary little thing that was wrong with it, I would suggest watching ClementJ642's 7-part rant.  I would put part one's web link below, but Amazon always deletes the link to prevent people from navigating away from the site, so I would do a search on Youtube for ""ClementJ642 Sonic 2006 Review"" to check it out when you have the time on your hands.  With that said, I will see you guys later, and the later 3D Sonic games are miles better than Sonic 2006 in execution.",positive

527,"First, Yes I do own this game, I bought it the day it came out.

The over game itself is fun and graphics are great. The game play suffers from the excessive commits from the game: Buzzkill, Avenger, Payback and all the other stupid things that pop up. There are way too many kill streaks that kill from the air, come on do we really need: Missiles, Helicopter and an AC130 gunship all at the same time.

The matchmaking system is horrible. It takes way to long to join a game. I am not kidding it takes about 5 min to join a game and the intermissions are way too long. There is no autobalance, you my start off on eventeams but since this game has a problem with dropping people to the lobby, you might be on a team 6 v 3. Also thaking about team size 6 v 6 sucks. What year is this 1980. You can play groundwar which is 9 v 9, but the lag is so bad most of the time; they should call lag war.

531,"The Wii version of Twilight Princess absolutely must never be played by anyone who has experienced the smooth, easy, and fluent controls of the GameCube version. The Wii version will make you so mad and frustrated, once you've found out how much you were lied to by the frauds at IGN and Game Trailers, who constantly raved about its ""perfect controls"" and ""exciting gameplay"". Please! In this version of the game, there is a floating fairy that corresponds to the position of the Wiimote with the TV and Sensor Bar, and you are required to keep this fairy dead center in the middle of the screen, or else Link will walk off in another direction, constantly fall off annoying small and big ledges, causing you to lose your balance, and slowing you down immensely. ***Edit*** I've recently been told by people in the comment section that players have the option to remove the onscreen fairy from the game. However, I completely doubt that this would change anything about the awful controls, because even if you were to remove the fairy, the problem would persist, as you would still be required to aim the Wiimote dead center at the screen, in order to keep Link moving straight. The control stick adjusts to whichever position you are aiming your Wiimote, so your arm must be aimed at the center of the screen in order for Link to move correctly. Also, it's been suggested by someone in the comment section that I had a ""faulty Wiimote and/or Nunchuck"". This is not true, as I sent my Wiimote directly to Nintendo, so that they could take a look at it; they said that they didn't need me to send in the Nunchuck. They sent me the Wiimote back and told me that they had fixed whatever was wrong with it. The problem continued, which means that the game was programmed that way. I don't know how anyone could have enjoyed having to hold their wrist up the entire time while playing, but it just wasn't for me. As I said to a commenter, ""The fairy on the cursor does need to remain dead center on the screen. If you lower your hand to rest it, either in your lap or on the arm of your chair or couch, while still trying to walk or run around in the game; Link will move in another direction then the one you are aiming with on the control stick."" ***Edit*** Your wrist will very quickly become strained from having to aim the Wiimote dead center in the middle of the screen continually during gameplay. Sometimes in the heat of the moment, if you accidentally aim the fairy too high, too low, too far to the left, or too far to the right of the screen, you will have to struggle for a few seconds to get the fairy pointing back to where you want it to be because there seems to be an annoying lag when the fairy goes to any corner of the screen. THIS MAJOR FLAW RUINED THE GAME! The fairy ruined this game! The game became unplayable because of this major flaw and I refused to play past the Lakebed Temple because of this major flaw with the controls. The game is unplayable!

The frauds on YouTube constantly boasted about how perfect this game was, making statements about how wonderful the Wii Mote controls are and how good it feels to swing the sword around. Total BS! Total BS. You don't swing the sword around at all. All you do is flick your wrist around and Link moves the sword in correspondence to a predetermined set of directions. You can't aim where the sword goes, it goes either in an upward/downward slice, a horizontal left/right slash, a forward stab, or a 360 spin. And nothing more! You can't move the sword around like a virtual reality game, as it was advertised to be. You can't move the sword in any direction that you want to; the sword goes in a limited, predetermined set of directions. The game doesn't know which direction you're swinging the sword in, it can only distinguish between vertical, horizontal, spin, and (if I recall correctly) forward stab.

The shield was even worse, remember WindWaker, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, you held a button when you wanted the shield and let go of the button when you didn't want the shield. This added an element of challenge and fun to the Zelda franchise. When Nintendo designed Twilight Princess, they decided to remove all elements of challenge and fun from the game for both the GameCube and Wii versions. In the GameCube version, when you pressed the L button to target an enemy, the shield would constantly be in use and you would never, ever get hit by an enemy, making it the easiest Zelda during the time with no challenge, no fun, and no strategy. The Wii version; my goodness, it's the exact same problem, except that when you need to hit an enemy with the shield, you have to punch at the screen with the Nunchuk in hand, and the annoying wire connecting the Nunchuk to the Wiimote will flicker about. That's a good reason not to advertise the Wii Mote as a wireless controller because it's not wireless when you have to connect the Nunchuk to it.

The annoying challenge when fishing in Ocarina of Time from having to hold down on both the R and the A buttons has become even worse in this game. Imagine those same issues, except you have to cast with the Wiimote by flinging it in a throwing motion across the screen, then when a fish bites, having to hold the Wiimote upwards for several long minutes, hurting your wrist and having to feel the vibration from the built in rumble feature. Bad enough? How about this, you have to rotate the Nunchuk in a circular motion, hurting your other arm simply to reel the fish in. This didn't feel like real fishing, STOP LYING TO YOURSELVES. This was by no means a successful execution of a fishing simulation.

Horse back riding is also destroyed by the Wiimote and Nunchuk, since you have to keep the on screen fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else Epona, like Link, will also move in another direction, slowing you down, making it take forever for her to regain momentum and balance after running you into obstacles and cliffs. While on horseback, you have to flick your wrist to make Link slash at enemies, which makes the onscreen fairy move all about, causing you to lose balance, just so you can fight the only three boar riding Moblin archers in all of Hyrule field.

Same thing when controlling the wolf, though it is even more annoying having to flick your wrist with the Wiimote to make him attack in the direction corresponding to the onscreen fairy. In the GameCube version the wolf was very well balanced and didn't usually fall off annoying cliffs if you didn't move perfectly. In this version, it's much worse because you have to keep the fairy dead center in the middle of the screen while moving the wolf, making him jump from cliff to cliff, or when flicking your wrist to attack enemies. All of this makes the wolf controls needlessly challenging in the Wii version.

This is awful, this has been the worst experience I've ever had playing Zelda. Bottom line, all the same problems from the GameCube version, with the lack of challenge and really easy to kill enemies and bosses are present in this version as well, but this one is much worse because of the controls of the Wiimote and Nunchuk. I only bought the Nintendo Wii just to see if the Wii version of this game was superior to the GameCube version, as I was lead to believe it was more challenging. The only challenge came from the atrocious controls of the Wiimote and Nunchuk.",negative

Remember, this controller will be stomped on with impact and frequency. I bought one for a gift and was embarrassed to find that it did not last more than a day of use. After I took it back to replace I noticed how cheaply made it was. I got the Konami brand controller and noticed a big difference in material quality and workmanship. The Konami controller never gave the recipient any problems. Be sure to to take the time to ask the seller if it is made by Konami or you'll get a cheaply made third-party one.

Anytime I play Terran or Protoss against the zerg, I knock the snot out of them. The zerg have been gutted and have piss poor crowd control, with only one unit having any major splash damage. That makes an enormous difference in a game where crowd control is absolutely essential.

545,"Update (July 10th 2012) - Condensed my review to hit the main points -- sticking with my overall 1-star review, read below to see why

Quick Pros:
Arkham Asylum/City-like combat (also a con ...)
Web-Rush
Web-Retreat
Boss-Battles
Stan Lee Cameos
In-game extras

Quick Cons:
Spider-Man is not Batman and should have not been treated that way
Repetitive is an understatement (combat and gameplay)
Short game -- little replayability
Shoddy Physics
Camera's too tight

I will give Beenox props for attempting a free roaming spider-man game when they haven't before (that effort has gone to Treyarch in the past) -- but what Beenox has delivered is very much not the free-roaming ""open world"" game that I was expecting. In comparison, the last free-roaming spider-man game was Web of Shadows (Treyarch) and the majority of my Spider to Spider comparison is to that. First off, Manhattan is not important in this game, there is very little to no interaction with the city or the people and the city is basically a backdrop as you very boringly swing from one location/objective to the next (swinging has been considerably dumbed down), which made swinging more of a chore than fun as it was in WoS (or Spider-Man 2). Also, the majority of the missions take place underground or inside, there are only two or three missions that actually take place on the streets (or the air) of Manhattan, so I felt overly claustrophobic for someone playing an ""open world"" game.

Also, there's no accepting or declining of ""random"" missions in the environment, afaik they're not ""random"" and you can't ""decline"" them you can just ignore them -- I ""accepted"" all of them so I don't know if they go away or just stay on your map but in WoS there were truly, randomly generated events in the world to take care of. And there's also no real variation in gameplay (or choices to make) or anything like that.

The reason I'm sticking with a 1-star review is because the game is not what I was told it would be. Honestly, if Beenox/Activision was advertising this along the veins of Shattered Dimensions, as a level based game that majorly took place indoors (or in enclosed spaces), I probably would give it 2.5 or 3-stars, but because it was advertised as a free-roaming, open world, random-encounter-laden game akin to Spider-Man 2 and Web of Shadows, I'm giving it one star. Here's to hoping Activision gives the next one to Treyarch (note that both Beenox and Treyarch are subsidiaries of Activision who has the license from Marvel to use Spider-Man). Or at the least Beenox gets the code Treyarch used for Web of Shadows.",negative
546,"There are two to three games that I will buy without having played every year. Pirates is not one of them.

I cannot stress the importance of renting enough to my fellow gamers out there. But for those of you that take the plunge and pick up this product, may your short-lived enjoyment serve as a reminder.

The graphics are mediocre for a game on a system like the PS3. There's a buncha horses under that hood and they certainly aren't being taxed by this. Gameplay itself is weak, uninteresting and repetitive. ""Punch like this, swing your sword like that, jump like a goof by doing the other thing""...fun stuff if you're trading in your NES and stepping up, a regular yawner if you left Super Mario behind in the Eighties. Camera angles quickly become annoying, enemy AI is suspect at best, the dueling is...well...dull.

To give credit where credit is due, the cut scenes are nice. Umm...yeah, those cut scenes really can make a game worth ownin...no they can't.

There are going to be another two hundred games just like this one in the coming year. Games that have enormous potential and simply fail to deliver.

552,"The worst bug apparently is limited to importing characters from original Dungeon Siege 2. Many (truly) folks, including me, can't even play the game because there is a limit to the number of characters, and this bug prevents you from switching characters in your group. For example, I tried to play a multiplayer party mode in which the limit was 3 characters. One early quest requires you to make a dwarf a member of your group. When you need to get your original party members back, the only way to do that is to release this dwarf to the Inn. When you do that, the game quits and when you start again, that character is gone from the game. There are many other problems related to this bug. This happened with both of my imported DS2 characters.

I would normally expect a patch to resolve this problem from the developers, but apparently the thinking is that this won't happen unless you import corrupted save files. My understanding is that they have not been able to figure out how these files get corrupted, even though they have been trying a long time. So I will be pleasantly surprised if they do find a way to fix this problem, but I'm not holding my breath.

In my opinion, the quality of Dungeon Siege 1 and Legends of Aranna was much better than anything after that, and Broken World is aptly named.",negative

And to no avail mind you: all these games received ZERO protection from their draconian DRM scheme when it came to preventing their piracy!

Exactly like Spore, for which the customer backlash was heard around the world, EA is trying to force this DRM scheme down its customers' throats instead of doing the reasonable thing: listening to them.

Since piracy will always be a factor to consider and everyone has the right to protect his investment, a form of DRM will also always exist. But, at the same time, this gives no one a free hand in entrapping and exploiting their own customers. Or using piracy as a thin pretext to slip snoopware into our computers!

- Revoking our rights as the Administrators of our own computer by creating irremovable folders or registry entries or subroutines that run masked is unacceptable!
- Bundling a snooping, auto-updating and in-secret-contact-with-the-mothership utility that retains backdoor access to our computers is unacceptable!!
- Trying to force legitimate gamers to pay again and again for the same game by Limiting its Installations is UNACCEPTABLE!!

I am sure that, in the end, the best and more effective DRM method will prove to be very simple: reasonable pricing. Who would place his computer in danger of Trojans, Worms or slow Viruses of a pirated copy when the original costs $20? And since even more people would buy the game, everyone should be happy. But fighting piracy was never what EA is aiming for (after all, piracy has been used to cover a multitude of executive blanders over the years).

Let's be honest: datavoring SecuROM subroutines and Limited Installations have NOTHING TO DO WITH FIGHTING PIRACY. They aim at making us pay for the same game AGAIN & AGAIN and preventing us from ever reselling our copies.

EA, you had me as a customer for years. I even gave your products more than fair reviews. Unless someone cleans house over there and you start listening to your customers, you cannot count on any more of my money.",negative

559,"The basic idea behind the game sounds fun. You're an SAS officer, sent off on a number of missions to save the world. It's a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.
The emphasis is on ""real-world"" fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.
There are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in ""real-time"". If you're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.
This ""real-world"" emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance ""reality"" with ""fun"". Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot (as it were).
I couldn't even get past the first level on ""normal"" difficulty. I'm not that bad at games (I've completed Half-life, Star Trek Elite Force etc.), but try as I might I couldn't get through the first mission. I'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there's no save game feature, so you have to go back to the start of the level. A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I'd already completed, shoot the sniper... and then got shot by someone else. Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again!
After I'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead.
As far as the rest of the game goes, other than the outdoor maps, there is very little special about the graphics - they're pretty much Quake2 engine standard (sub Half-Life). All that running around, climbing ladders etc. is pretty passe these days (how old is Tomb Raider ?), and there is really nothing new that this game does.
I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review. As it stands, without a save game feature, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. If Eidos get around to patching the game (there's no sign of it yet), and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again. As it stands, I'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition... ""The element is behind you!"" or Counterstrike.
Pro: 1. The satelite camera is quite cool. 2. Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS.
Con 1. You cant save your game. 2. Too easy on ""easy"". 3. Impossible on any difficulty setting above ""easy"" (partly because there is no save game option). 4. No multiplayer. 5. Dodgy voice acting.",negative

566,"What ""draw"" me to this game (no pun intended), was the fact that you could create your own character and other elements in the game. Sounds fun, no?

That is not as fun as it should be, mainly because you are limited to the space, proportions and templates that the game gives you. There's not that much depth in it, and after an hour or two of playing you'll just be doing things just to get them over with.

Gameplay wise is boring, jump here, shoot there, and backtrack if you forgot something. This is the most annoying aspect of the gameplay. In each level you must rescue three ""raposas"" and collect 4 torn pieces of a template. If you skipped one, you won't be able to move on, but the game doesn't even remotely tells you what section you may or may not have missed. Making backtraging tedious and a constant.

The game difficulty is very easy, but in some stages is easy to die while jumping or flying, mainly because when you jump or ""take-off"" you won't be able to see the enemies coming right at you making you lose health or die.

Story wise, you play as the creator (you know God), who must help a village to defeat darkness. This is how the game goes:

1-Talk to mayor
2-Talk to some other raposa
3-Talk to mayor
4-Tap on the flame of life
5-Remove darkness from one section
6-Talk to previous raposa
7-Return to talk to the mayor
7.5 You may need to talk to another raposa again
8-Go through a gate and start ""playing.""

Is really annoying, the characters are dumb, there's really no meat to the story. You never feel bad for them, at a point I saw why the ""creator"" forgot about them, they' boring, annoying and demanding.

567,"I rarely ever review games I haven't played through to completion.  Even if I think the game isn't that fun, I still try to stick with it to give a full comprehensive review.  This game, however, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  As my title suggests, the main reason I couldn't do it was the combat system.

When I first loaded the game I thought the opening sequence took far too long.  I was afraid this game was going to be trying way too hard to be cinematic.  Sometimes this works out well, but other times it's just overdone.  I feel like ""Headhunter: Redemption"" is overdone.  When I was first playing around with the controls I thought you could do some pretty cool stuff with your character.  When I first used the combat system I didn't think it would be that much of a detriment.  Then I went into live combat...

Basically the aiming reticule moves around like your hands are shaking uncontrollably.  Even when your character is standing still it does this.  Now, I've fired guns in real life, I can hold my hand far more still than this game.  You spend most of your time aiming all over the place waiting for the ""auto aim"" to lock onto the target.  If you're moving this is ten times more difficult.  And yes, you have to use this functionality because you have to hold down the trigger to go into the aiming mode then hit ""A"" if you want to actually fire the gun.  It's stupid and I hate it.

A way to balance the dysfunctional combat would be to have health packs all over the place or make your character invincible to enemy bullets.  Neither of these is true and the latter is usually absurd in a video game as standard functionality.  There are health packs, but they don't work the same way in other games.  They're more like medkits that you pick up and then you have to ""equip"" them in a totally different screen.  So, if you're in a major fire fight there's nothing you can really do about it, but die.  There's no health you will run over and it will automatically heal you, you have to stop and go into that other screen.  Granted the game pauses when you do this, but it disrupts the combat elements so much that getting back into it could be a death sentence in the long run.

I've never played the first game, but if it's like this I don't want to.  The story line is based in the future and you're trying to help the ""authority"" in that universe control the criminal underground.  I think it wants to sort of be a ""secret agent"" type of game, but it just wasn't fun at all.  You go in and investigate security breeches and what not, but once the combat starts the fun ends.  I think this could've been a decent game.",positive

575,"The game installed fine, but when you go to play it, there is a digital rights management program called Star Force which must be set up first. I wish I had researched it online first, because it totally destroyed my operating system twice.

After the first install, and attempt to run the program, Star Force popped up and said I had to install it to play the game. Next I had to reboot my PC. Okay, no problem so far. Next thing I know my computer crashes, goes into a DOS-like screen where Windows tells me it has to do a system repair. At first I thought this might have been a hiccup, but later I tried installing the game again and the exact same thing happened.

Next I tried it on my laptop, and while it didn't require a system repair, the program just wouldn't load (I'm running XP 32bit on both computers by the way).

As with many of these DRM programs, there seems to be a complete lack of ethics. I was not given the option to remove Star Force (it was never listed on either machine in Control Panel>Programs and Features). So I had to do a system restore on my laptop as well.

Search the web before buying any program that has DRM such as this. Let the buyer beware.",neutral
576,"Alright, first of all the servers were down right out of the gate. To Rare's credit, they hop on this and fix it. They did a lot better job than Capcom in this manner.

Hat's off to them for that.

Alright, so the game finally starts for me, and do you know the first.. THE FIRST THING that happens to me? I can't find my ship. I'm on a little island, wandering around. And I don't know what to do. WELL I eventually see this signal flare out in the water.. I swim to it, and its like ""Do you want to spawn back at your ship?"" Uh, yes please!

I also got attacked, on this island, right out of the gate. The same fools that attacked me had also sunk my ship. BEFORE I EVEN managed to figure out anything.

The next thing that happens, is well I got in my ship, FINALLY.. doing it solo.. and it takes me forever, but my first destination is ""Booty Island"" I figure, why not? sounds like a great name! I make it there, I wander around ""Snake island"" because that's what it really should have been called.. I then head over to ""Thieves Haven"" .. I grab a treasure chest, and I head up to.. ""Plunders Outpost"" basically an Island where you turn your stuff in.. A little hub area. I get killed, my loot stolen. And that's garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.

Do I regret my purchase? as it stands, very much so. This reminds me of the days when I started playing multiplayer on console.. I think it was Halo2.. and I got spawn killed, over and over and over. This is like the same thing.. It's junk. Who enjoys this, except the person sitting there and just waiting on someone to spawn up in a ship or something?

So its not explicitly stated, I'm sure it was in the marketing material somewhere. But this game is online only.

Also the UI for quest is kind of confusing.

You have no mini map you can open up. As far as I can tell. But who knows?

The in game UI for your items, is clunky, its straight forward, but it doesn't work well..

The combat mechanics, kinda suck.

Buy at your own risk.

I haven't bought a game like this, where I've just straight up hated it, right from the get go, in about a decade and a half..

Take my review as an over all sample of the whole, this was just my experience right from the start. Maybe if you jump in to some multiplayer with other people..and all that jazz, maybe it will work out better? Good luck to all you wood be pirates, hopefully you make it a step further than I did.",neutral

578,"Bought two of these cables after the original three foot cable died after two years of use. The two new cables came in the usually small Amazon zip lock bag wrapped up. After i took out the first cable and used it for about two weeks the cable wouldn't charge the controller. I thought it was my controller going bad since the cable was brand new. So then I pulled out the second one that was still in the packing and connected it to my controller just to see what would happen and boom my controller came right back on. I thought to myself that the first cable was just a faulty cable and this second one should surely work. Again after two weeks the second cable went out also! I don't know if PS4 cables were not meant to be this long or if the manufacturer is using poor assembly practices,bad parts, or maybe the way they package and store the cables but these cables are not lasting at all. I never wrapped them up in any way that would break the copper as I always had them laid out straight since I am usually using them for a few hours a day.

582,"I will echo the words of so many others who have made the mistake of purchasing this ""game.""  My system exceeds the ""recommended requirements"" printed on the box, and yet the game, when it runs, runs horrificly.
for example:
1:  every time you enter a new region in the game, gameplay stops for solid minutes while the new region loads.
2:  Every time I approach an NPC to interact, the game locks up for at least 60 seconds, while it loads whatever snippet of info the NPC has associated with it.
3:  The game will sporadically lock up for 2-3 minutes, for no apparent reason.
4:  Loading a game takes around 5 minutes.
5:  support is horrible.  Beyond the standard, weak advice to ""load the most recent graphic card drivers and re-install direct X 8.1"", there is zero- I repeat- ZERO customer support available.
6:  the ingame graphic engine causes my geforce 2 to lock up, even when the game is played at 640X480.
  Geez- I could go on- but I think the above 6 examples (which- trust me- are the very tip of the iceberg of faults that this game comprises) are reason enough to avoid this.  Playing this game is neither fun, enjoyable, or even tolerable.
Furthermore- after un-installing this game, my copy of CREATURE ISLE no longer plays properly.  It's rare that a game comes along that actually does DAMAGE to your system...",neutral

The ""Franchise mode"" in this game is horrible.
There is a lot of information missing that is needed to run a team.
Ex: When asked to cut players, no information is given.  All i get is their overall and each individual rating.
I need to know how long their contract is, what are his stats for the preason, age.....

I'm just supposed to cut players based on their overall????

Another example is free agency.

Biggest dumpfest of all.

All the information I get is their age, how much money they want, and a mini description of the type of player, like ""Speedy Receiver""
Why can't I see their career stats, season stats?  What teams has he played for? maybe played for a rival.  What if they are speedy but have low catch rating??

I'm just supposed to pay up and get a ""speedy receiver""

Also if I'm the coach why can't I change player positions???

The Connected Career Mode is a step back in my opinion.

590,"Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided

*Sigh* Where to begin...

This game could be better named:
""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".

Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).

*Wave Hand* ""This is not the game you are looking for... Move along!""

PLEASE, READ ON...

In the beginning...
This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.

They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""

We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figured out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...

Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...

They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could ""streamline"" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!

The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?

The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.

As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.

This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.

Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!

SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.

You have been warned!",negative

I own both Xbox 360, and PS3 and thought it be nice to own all 3 current gen systems , so i grabbed it thinking it be great. Well its not,

+ I get to play some great Gamecube games which i missed out on since i never owned a GC
+ GC controllers can work for some Wii games
+ Built in Wifi
+ Small system doesnt take up alot of space

-the graphics suck, after playing PS3 and Xbox 360 it seems like i go back in time to last gen when i play the wii.
- The Motion control is NOT precise and lags, though i hear Wii Motion Plus fixes it.
- It gets very costly, 40 for Remote, 20 for Nunchuck and 20 for Wii Motion plus, thats 80$ for a complete controller set
- Online gaming sucks big time, no matter what game i play online it lags like hell
- FRIEND CODES....wtf is this garbage
- The Sensor bar is garbage and seems like it can snap any second
- VERY few good games, majority games are crap or kiddy games
- No hard drive
- Not HD, we live in the HD age now, its a shame that this system is not HD
- 50$ more and you can buy a PS3 or 360

1.  The game is EXTREMELY glitchy.
2.  The graphics look like back in the day Playstation I graphics.
3.  The age progession should be able to be turned off, as I didn't get to accomplish what I needed or wanted to.
4.  My sim was watching t.v. and couldn't get up from the sofa, and died of hunger.
5.  No firemen to put out house fires.  My stove caught on fire, and sim did too, and died.  Why are fire alarms
  needed?
6.  People walk through people, cars jam up into each other.
7.  There was a logjam of people at the entrance to the restaurant, and they ended up dying.
8.  You find yourself ""mourning"" and don't know why until you figure out that there are various tombstone markers
  around town from Sims that have died, that you have to put in your inventory and place them at the cemetery.
9.  Once you choose an outfit/hair-- you cannot change them.
10. You cannot build homes.
11. Books- I have no idea how to read certain ones (i.e., cooking) once I've purchased them.  Once they are
  placed in the bookshelf, you cannot choose a particular book.  You end up reading whatever is there.
  Therefore, there were certain recipes that I couldn't make, 'cause I couldn't choose the particular book.

  inside of the house.

Haven purchased a new PS4 I needed a triple-A game to remind me why I spent so much money on my console, and having watched all the Unity pre-launch videos, downloading the Companion App, I was ready for an evening in Paris when it arrived.  (Note: I debated heavily between spending my $60 on Unity or Dragon Age which comes out 1 week later and decided on Unity).

What a PIECE this game is.  I'm sorry, but this is bad.  Bugs Bugs Bugs and TERRIBLE gameplay.  I get stuck EVERYWHERE.  Stuck on a ledge and can't move, stuck on a window and can't go in or out, stuck on a chimney, stuck in crouch mode and look like a dork walking around.  How did this EVER make it thru QA??  You can't run very well on the rooftops because you get stuck everywhere.

Let me list a few others:
-LONG LONG load times (heaven forbid you actually DIE in the game - you will wait forever to get back to the game).
-Bad UI.  Just try to find the EXIT GAME option.  Can't?  Neither can I.
-Prevents my PS4 from going to sleep?  My PS4 has yet to go to sleep if Unity running for some reason.
-Micro Transactions
-Graphics nowhere near as stunning as Black Flag

Then the WORST party foul ever.  Try to open a blue chest.  Can't because it says these chests can only be opened after playing the Companion App on your phone.  So I go to my phone and the Companion App (which I've played earlier) has now lost all of my settings and won't let me do ANYTHING.  The UBISOFT forums indicate this is a known problem but no workaround yet.  I loaded the app on my iPad and same result (it seems it's a problem with UBISOFT accounts not necessarily the App itself).

I want to hang my head in SHAME because I'm one of the fools that also pre-ordered the Season Pass thinking I wanted to bundle as much of this awesome game as possible.  Every instinct warned me to wait for reviews, but I didn't listen.  The fault is mine that's for sure, but I'll do my best to share my story so others don't make the same mistake.  This company has a great Marketing Team, as it suckered me in and now I wish I had my money back.",neutral
610,"The game starts out as a very quick, lively game involving campaigning to become president.  While put out in time for the 2004 Election season, you can choose among a cadre of many different politicians, from modern senators, to ex-presidents, to ""legends"" such as George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, etc.

The routine is a very fun, turn-based thing in which you must travel across the country, build campaign headquarters, give speeches, pay for ads, hire political operatives (such as smear merchant to lower your candidates approval in the state, or even intimidators who raise your approval by 5% per turn) or political capital to gain the support of organizations such as the NRA, NAACP, Women's groups, environmental groups, etc, and fundraisers.

However, as soon as election night comes around and you either win or lose, that's pretty much the end of the game.  There's no replay value in the game, as everything goes exactly the same way and can be fully accomplished within an hour",negative
611,"Pros:  A decently fun addition to the Red Alert series with some fun new units and a major graphics update.  Lots of cute new characters for those who liked the women of the RA series.  Supports high resolution gaming :).  Fun to run it at 1920 by 1200 with all effects set to maximum.  Good graphics compared to many other RTS games I have played.

That all sounds fantastic, but don't lose sight of the short (but VERY SIGNIFICANT) list of CONS:
--------------------------

*Limited Installations mean you don't really 'own' the game, you're just renting it at full price. (if you're buying a retail copy, and not a copy from Steam)

*SecuROM (again, assuming you're getting retail and not Steam) This SecuROM stuff that RA3 will install on your computer before you're able to play is BAD NEWS.  Many people have had serious difficulties with their computers after SecuROM has infested them, and apparently it is not very easy to get rid of once it has infested your computer.

*The RA3 Tanya just wasn't as good as RA2 Tanya.  Kari Wuhrer did a much better job, and the actual Tanya UNIT is not as fun to play with either.  Tanya's range has been reduced to a point where enemy infantry (yes, even conscripts) can now shoot Tanya before she can shoot them.  Tanya is no longer the sort of ""hero"" unit that, with a small amount of support and a good deal of micromanagement can wipe out whole platoons of enemy infantry and bases with style.  This was a huge negative, as Tanya has played a very central role to the Red Alert universe for several of the Red Alert games now.  Going back to the Kari Wuhrer point though.. Kari was much more ""tough"" whereas the new Tanya is basically a cheerleader dressed up as Tanya, and she really just doesn't fit the role as well.

*Tanya's guns just aren't as good (or cool) as they used to be.  Looks like she's got some Desert Eagles now or something instead of the classic old .45 colts, and her range has been reduced to a point where she is basically neutered as a unit.  Not cool.  I don't even use her anymore to speak of because of this.

To sum things up, you'll probably enjoy the game, but it just lacked some essential things Red Alert 2 had.  However, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you purchase the game on STEAM instead of in boxed retail form, since STEAM will not include any of the activation limits or SecuROM malware/trojans/spyware type of crap that will infest your computer if you install the retail version.  I might have given the game 4 stars or so if not for the negatives I listed.  Due to SecuROM in particular, I'm gonna have to give this a measly one star.  If you're considering getting the game on STEAM though, no worries about the DRM concerns I listed as far as I know, so this review in large part wouldn't apply.",positive
612,"After long anticipating getting Bioshock 2, I preordered it from Amazon, waited for it to arrive, and then found that not only do you have to have the CD in the machine, but you MUST have a Windows LIVE account to play the game.  Then, to add insult to injury, the game doesn't support playing with a USB controller.  None of this was identified in the marketing hype leading up to its release.  And, it isn't until you agree to the license that you discover these things.

Why is this an issue...

1)  Why do I have to have a CD in a drive if I also have to log onto LIVE?
2)  I live way out in the middle of no-where and have dial-up... yes, dial-up for internet connectivity.  At 18.2k, being online is not much of an option let alone getting updates.

Now on that controller thing... Bioshock 1 supported a controller.  And they say that they spent all of their time ""getting the UI right for the keyboar"".  But, I don't think they did anything.  First of all...if they spent so much time getting the UI right for the keyboard, then why are the mouse buttons reversed by default?  Why would the left button fire the right hand gun, and the right button fire the plasmid with the left hand.

As for the game... pretty much the same games as Bioshock 1 in a bit of a different map.  Graphics are about the same.  Remember how you played Bioshock 1 and you got to the point that you thought was the end of the game and then had to become a Big Daddy?  Well...no such surprise in this one.  Just play, kill, and you are done.  No twists to the plot, no interesting strange surprises.  And the new weapons are worthless compared to the ones that you probably used the most in Bioshock 1...Fire, Freeze, and bullets.  The new stuff is practically useless.

I was absolutely mesmerized by Bioshock 1.  I was let down by Bioshock 2.  And on top of that, the DRM is positively abnoxious.

616,"For a while this remote worked fairly well. It is okay with Netflix and Amazon, not so good with Hulu. It does work with dvd/blueray. It will work on some tv's, it only had limited functionality on mine. My main problem with this remote is that sometimes it stops working. At first I thought it was bad batteries so I changed them. It worked fine for a while then quit. I'm not sure if it's a bad bluetooth transmitter or what the problem is, but it can be quite frustrating.

618,"Simplified and major step down from previous games. Tiny Linear maps, bad writing and acting. Too many MMO mechanics that felt out of place like in boss fights. Also the graphics and backgrounds were blurry and messy, I felt eye strain looking at the screen. Bad use of fog effects too. Not to mention the graphics and some monsters were pulled right from WoW. This is not Diablo. The game hits hack and slash alright but many other games do it better. This game is a blight on the franchise that Spawned this type of game especially after a 12 year wait. I was rather bored playing, the world feels detached and wooden compared to d1 and d2s world that sucked you in. If this game had a different name then diablo it would be easier to swallow but it felt like they spit in the eye of the franchise with this. And the RMAH feels scammy. And that sickening DRM always online, cant play offline is a joke and insult.

620,"I'll tell anyone with an ear what I think about this game... or 2 eyes to read my review. It is absolutely awful. Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!

For those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!

Plot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.

Characters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. ""Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs.""

Gameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a ""singer"" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.

Music: *gag*

Overall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one. If you buy it, I very much hope you are only buying it to melt it into unrecognizable plastic so it can be recycled. Otherwise you are encouraging this scatter-brained drivel to be reproduced in the future.",negative
621,"Turned my wonderful 5 year old nephew into a vidiot. Ok that's too strong, he's a bright kid, socialble kid, but he became too obsessed by this game and the figurines. He had about 10 or so of them and always wanted more. He gets locked in, and ignores anything but the game, goes in guns blazing, player dies, puts the next character on the portal, rinse and repeat. When all his characters are gone he bugs mom and dad and his uncle for new characters from the store $15 bucks a pop. His parents had to take away his video game privledges and he's now doing more constructive things like reading, puzzles, drawing, etc.

These games aren't constructive kids games, don't fool yourself, thats the point they are hard enough that you die quicker than normal, so you need more pieces to stay alive longer. Why do you think Disney went scrambling to make this game? Skylanders was monopolizing the market making money hand over fist.

The point of the developers making these games isn't to make a fun game for your child, it's about selling figurines.

Solution ? Stick with a fantastic Lego video game instead; Lego Star Wars, Lego Batman, Lego Harry Potter, Lego Pirates of the Carribean, etc.  If your child is a few years older, the Mario games are an excellent choice, well made games that will offer hours of enjoyment.",positive
622,I bought this for my Sister and all was fine however then Sony released a firmware patch and It bricked the console. Now it won't even turn on. The only fixes that Sony offers are not safe which I don't trust myself doing.  I'm at a loss as to what I should do.,negative
623,"I got a pair of these, one black and one white. When I first got them they were a little bit of a pain to get on the controller, but once on, they were nice. The little nubs helped to keep a hold of the controller when the action got intense and my hands got sweaty. For that reason, I gave these 2 stars.

The trouble starts when you want to charge them. I have a charging dock that the controllers slide into to charge. Needless to say the covers have to be removed to place on the charger. Not a big deal, BUT beware, if you have just finished playing and want to charge the controller, you have probably been playing for a short while and the controller is warm from your body heat as is the cover. This is where the problem starts, at least for me. As I was removing the cover, something I had done many times before, a small tear occurred on the back side on the inside of the hand grip area. Over time and more use this tear grew to the point of the cover being useless. Then the second cover, one that I did not use as much, started to feel sticky. I washed it in warm water, seemed to help some.

Since silicone is prone to getting this sticky feeling and my wife has some silicone backing items that she cleans in the dishwasher I thought it would be safe and sanitary to clean these covers in the dishwasher. I do not heat dry my dishes, I let them air dry and the covers got the same treatment. The second one became real loose fitting and at this point they both ended up in the garbage.

If you are looking for something to add to your controllers for some better grip and game play, look for Real Triggers, here on Amazon. They are like five bucks a set and clip on the L2 & R2 buttons and make them stick out a bit more making it easier to hold and feels more like a trigger from a gun. As I play mainly shooters this is a real plus!",neutral
624,"Update: 9/29/17
This game is GARBAGE! The nrs devs keep making the grind harder with each patch. The new legendary multiverse requires unrealistic goals for anyone with a life. Look it up..its unfair requirements are for 1 piece of gear(>_<)one! The latest patch 1.10 will delete unlocked shaders, and shaders you bought.. and in many cases ALL your gear and abilities!! I lost 100 pieces of gear and all my recently purchased shaders from patch 1.09! I had to call Sony to get my money back! Also the new raiden dlc was CLEARLY seen as a chance for these liberal devs to mock President Donald Trump. Its very distasteful! Black Lightning says things like ""thats an alternative fact"", and ""thats fake news"". I'm not even kidding look up his dialogue. I bought the deluxe edition because I enjoyed the 1st game. The devs are using this as a platform to voice their distain for The President, push social justice warrior propaganda throught DLC characters, and rip off fans with source Crystal exploits for premier skins and shaders! This is the worst game yet from nrs. I am so angry that they rather take shots at THE President Donald Trump, than fix the source Crystal microtransaction exploit that prevents us from unlocking ALL shaders with hardwork. If you buy this game you will be exposed to liberal garbage opinions, instead of a well balanced game! I'm an independent voter that didn't vote(I was a Bernie or Bust guy) and this has me wishing I voted Trump. It's so childish to make us pay for this dialogue that has NOTHING to do with DC comics. I am a profile lvl 80 and ranked 800 across the board; So take it from me as a Top 10% player this game is not worth your money. At NRS they want to make statements NOT games! Do yourself a favor and stay away.

Plays just like a movie! Tons of fantastic
moves, and a genuinely fantastic game! The worst part is the people playing this game. Very poor morals, bad online sportsmanship, and a general lack of respect. Just play offline unless you like showing them who's boss. The gear suffers from random grind drops and greed. Source crystals are exploited. They are nearly impossible to get past leveling up..even then you only get 200max. You need 4000 to but shaders and 6000 to unlock premier skins. Not cool. This game is going to be very expensive to complete! Well over $150 if you get all skins and characters. I have the ultimate edition. I got it early and got a free shirt to boost! It was a very good early release event! Great game!",neutral

Graphics are extraordinary. Very fluid, easy to use controls...but thats where it ends. The game is extremely repetitive. I expected more in-depth swordplay control. Once you get the counter-attack move you are basically unstoppable. No need to run and hide. Just counter-attack your opponents and kill them with one move. The AI is no smarter than any other game out, in fact there are alot dumber than most next-gen games, like Call of Duty 4 for example. They rarely attack simultaneously. They wait for you to kill thier comrade then its their turn to be countered and killed in one move.
All in all Im very dissapointed. I think most of these reviewers were anticipating the game so much they have convinced themselves its a great game and don't want to belive how bad a game it really is. Or maybe the graphics are so good they don't notice how shallow the game is. If anybody wants a barely used Assasins Creed game check for mine on ebay.

It also has what I find to be extremely restrictive DRM in the form of securom that I consider to be a security risk as it's always running, even when the game is not.

The story line isn't particularly enthralling.",neutral
635,"I bought this game expecting an exciting GTA-like open world game where I'm free to do what I want, but unfortunately the only combat to be found in this game is chopping down trees. I'm serious! There's only one weapon - the axe. And you can't even kill anybody! If you go up to them and try to hit them, it'll just start a conversation with them.

You live in a neighborhood full of animals such as dogs, cats, etc, and they all live in their own house. You would expect there to be an option to rob them, or kill them in their sleep or something, right? After all, this is supposed to be a video game where you can do whatever you want. But you can't! If you try to chop their door down with the axe at night, it'll just inform you that they're sleeping.

So as I'm starting my game I'm just waiting for a Fallout 3-esque menu to pick what skills I want to level up, and I wanted to play this game being as stealthy as possible. But unfortunately, there's no leveling up system, no weapons, no combat, nothing! We live in the year 2013, where gaming has evolved into a beautiful way to escape reality, and they weren't even bothered to add something that makes it feel like you're playing a game? Even games from the 1970s had combat! Like, Nintendo, seriously? If you're going to make an open world game, at least try to make it PLAY like an open world video game!

Now, enough about the things you CAN'T do. Let's talk about the things you CAN do. You can pluck weeds. Go fishing. Talk to neighbors (With only ONE THING TO SAY to them, as opposed to having many conversation choices in games like Fallout 3 and Mass Effect) Catch bugs. Sell stuff. Pay off your house. Make your house bigger. Decorate your house. Yes, I'm talking about a VIDEO GAME. Doesn't it sound like things your mom would ask you to do? Aren't those the kind of things you play video games to escape from?

The beautiful thing about video games are that they dump you in a world where you can be whatever you want, they make you feel like somebody you could never dream of being. You can fight enemies, kill innocent people, you can be anybody you want to be! But in this game, all you can be is a stupid little kid who does chores. That's what this game should be called: ""Stupid Little Kid Who Does Chores"".

If you're looking to bore yourself to sleep, or if you're like a 3 year old baby, then by all means, purchase this game. It's definitely up your alley. But if you want a fleshed out, immersive game that lets you be anybody you want to be, then look elsewhere.",negative

639,"This is a pretty slickly-made game that could have held the promise of hours of entertainment.  Unfortunately, I think they simply made the game too hard.  Although you can significantly ratchet down the difficulty on ""Skirmish"" mode, the difficulty on campaign mode is infernal, even if you set it to ""Easy,"" a setting that seems to have no effect.  I'm not sure if the game originally came out this way, but at least as of the 1.09 patch, some of the campaign missions are now simply impossible to do, even if you attempt them several times.

Yes, those people at EA are idiots.  It's the easiest thing in the world to program a computer game that can swiftly slay human players.  What would be impressive is making a game that is balanced and which your average player has a fair shot of winning.  As it is, the computer never makes a mistake and never wastes any resources.  It has no problem micromanaging a zillion soldiers and using all their special abilities at precisely the right moments.  Unlike humans, it knows which of its structures have been damaged and sets about repairing them with never a delay.  No forces are accidentally forgotten about, the wrong unit is never ordered, units are never mistakenly sent anywhere, and in general all resources are being used to their fullest possible extent.  Efficiency of this type for a human is impossible since you're dealing with dozen and dozens of units and probably several bases.  And you're not permitted to slow the game down in campaign mode.

I'm sure there are some people out there who have managed to get through the three campaigns without cheating, but we're talking about the kind of nerds who dedicate their lives to these games and play them for hundreds of hours.  For the average Joe, you will not be able to get through the campaign missions starting at about missions #8-10 of the GDI.

There's another problem, too.  This game is one of those new ones that installs spyware and monitorware on your computer to make sure you don't have certain programs installed, that everything you're doing with your burner drives is kosher, and that your game is an original copy.

The problem is that EA doesn't answer the phone when the game tries to call in to register itself, which it does the first time you try to play it.  It took me days to get it to work, since I kept getting ""This game is not available right now.  Please try again at a later time,"" or ""We're sorry.  EA's servers are busy.  Please try again at a later time.""

You'd think if EA were going to do this with all their games, they'd have the foresight to set up servers that can handle the load of all their customers, but I guess not.

I would also strongly caution against buying this used or downloading it.  In the first case, the serial number will not work since the previous user will have of course registered it (he wouldn't have been able to play the game if he hadn't), meaning that you will have bought a useless plastic disk that can be installed but not played.  In the case of downloads, they don't give you a manual -- and this is one of those highly elaborate strategy games that definitely require one.",negative

643,"Assassin's Creed 2 is a very well made game on its own and a vast improvement over AC1.  It provides a semi-open gaming environment with a well balanced mixture of exploration, combat, free running (Parkour), and a sort of pseudo-but-enjoyable stealth gameplay.

To begin with, like its predecessor, the game does have beautiful graphics and well designed levels that let Gamers experience the Italian Renaissance in some famous the city-states such as Florence, Tuscany, and Venice.  Indeed, the level designs, although some what idealized, seem very authentic when compared against some of the pictures of the actual locales.  On the other hand, character design is a mixed bag.  The men generally look good, but not the women (what's up with that ?)

Furthermore, although I am not qualified to comment on the degree of authenticity of the architecture and the attires of the period -  they sure look authentic to me - I can truly say that weapon designs are authentic (except for the pistol and the hidden blades which I don't know enough to comment on).  Edged weapon collectors and enthusiasts like myself will instantly recognize some designs unique to this approximate time period such as the Cinquedea (a dagger with very wide fuller) or the Schiavona (the Italian version of the Scottish Basket Hilt Claymore).  As a side note for the collectors out there, almost all of the weapons featured in the game can be found on The Museum Replica Limited catalog (I think this is actual source material for the dev team).  Bravo to the dev team for the extraordinary level of dedication to authenticity in weapon design.

As for the gameplay, the constant reminder of the stupid `animus machine' that does not really achieve anything besides breaking the immersion of the game in AC1 is mostly gone.  Although it is still there in AC2, you hardly interact with it anymore.  This is bar none the biggest improvement over AC1 IMO since the rude interruption of immersion is what really prevented me from finishing AC1.

Talking about immersion, the game also does a very good job of that.  Along with richly detailed level designs mentioned earlier, each city-state has its own distinctive atmosphere, and the in-game background music - usually with a dab of Gregorian chants - is also a nice touch that adds to the overall experience.

Combat wise, it is nice to be wielding authentic weapons in a series of nicely animated moves.  However, in spite of the numerous moves, the combat elements is not all that deep; you only need to remember about 3 crucial moves (`disarm' and `counter-kill' is the best).  Free running is fun but can be very challenging on the side quests.  The story is decent enough to keep you interested, but the mingling of fact and fiction is what make it really interesting to me.

In addition to some console features (such as having to approach the spot on the ground with the `twirly light' to advance the story) that slightly detract from the immersion factor, and the `Da Vinci' code wannabe decoding sequences, Stealth elements are incomplete - if not weak.  Evidently, this assassins does not possess true stealth of cover and concealment (remember the classic ""Thief"" series ?); his only meant of avoidance of detection is really speed and agility.  However, even when the gameplay seems to be absurd, it still somehow manages to be fun.  For example, being the only guy wearing a hood and standing in the middle of four prostitutes who are flaunting their `wares' ... is NOT blending into the crowd; but as you can see, this could be fun... I ought to try it sometimes.

Also, in AC2, you have a villa and a walled town to call your own that you can maintain and improve (almost like the D'Arnise Keep style from Baldur's Gate 2) that, when properly renovated, will provides more cash income than you know what to do with.  You can also put on your own nifty touch by collecting famous paintings (but not sculptures) to decorate and add values to your family property.  Again, a very nice touch.

In short, AC2 is a very good game that teeters on the border of being an exceptionally great game.  And although I wish to go back to the Holy Land and the Middle East again in AC2, I must admit that cantering around the rolling hills of Tuscany on horseback never really get old.  Regrettably, the happiness must end for the PC version of the game -- Even this deadly assassin is crippled by abusive DRM.

Even though it is never explicitly stated, the primary purpose of DRM - especially the excessive and overbearing type of DRM, such as limited online activation, or in this case, online activation AND permanent internet connection -  is to *TIE ONE USER TO ONE LICENSE* by eliminating the sales of the actual product (since the actual product is protected by the First Sale Doctrine), and forcing the sale of a license only -- Everything else is secondary - piracy is just a convenient pretext to achieve this purpose.

Evidently, Ubisoft is willing to go to any length to achieve this purpose - including deliberately insulting its Customers and their intelligence - with this type of extreme DRM.  It is rare when industry insiders and DRM/corporate sympathizers are openly speaking out against their own, but Ubisoft has really crossed the line this time. As is, my message to Ubisoft will be curt:  Revert to a more reasonable DRM that Customers can compromise with  - such as a disc check, or GET OUT of the PC Gaming sector for good.  You will NOT be missed.

A message to my fellow Customers: However you choose to speak out against Ubisoft and this type of extreme DRM, please refrain from pirating this game.  It may seems like a good way to piss down Ubisoft's throat for now, but in the long run, it is not worth compromising our integrity as legitimate Customers for; no game - no matter how good - is worth this.

If you must play this game - a good game from an excellent dev team misrepresented by the Ubisoft suits  - consider renting the console version, or buying the game *used* for the consoles so that the greedy publisher will see as little of your money as possible.  I was waiting for the PC version  - since AC1 PC version is superior - but I am somewhat glad that I bought  a used copy for the Xbox360  when the price drop to $26.  Had I known about the travesty of PC version, I would have waited even longer to buy a used copy for even cheaper.

654,"Seriously, the ""version"" that I had of this better-left-cancelled game, there was no way I could force myself to finish it. I'm not even sure what mission I was on last, but enough was enough. The bugs, the seriously lack luster put together story, the horrendous AI, the random ""let's turn this into Call of Duty!"" mentality, and the terrible, TERRIBLE attempt to refine the graphics are only to name a few. Oh, and the gigantic ""ooooooooooooo"" franchise plot twist that the developer(s) thought was genius. It's just sad that the only thing that was done right was the sound.

I read that multiplayer was better polished for this cesspool. However, that should have been my immediate turn off. I'm sorry, but I was expecting an appropriate sequel to Aliens by single player means. THEN if that portion was good enough, I would want to indulge into multiplayer to continue my money's worth.  enchancment mods alone for the PC version will never save this game. The damage has been severely done, or in this case, NEVER fixed. At least Mass Effect 3 was purely enjoyable for 95% of the game. This thing is terrible as soon as it starts. It's Duke Nukem Forever and Gearbox trying to cash in on something they knew was bad all over again. But this one hurts the most if you are a Aliens fan.

I am so glad that I did not pay a penny to play this peice of garbage. I really don't have to go into details on why it's so bad. If you have to know yourself firsthand, just youtube gameplay videos. Do not play this piece of garbage. In fact, if you have to kill your ""must play something from Aliens universe"" craving, just play the last Aliens vs Predator game by Rebellion. The really short human campaign was 100000000x better than the 4-8 hours I forced myself to play of Aliens: Colonial Marines. Don't even bother with buying this super cheap on here or Steam.

661,"I bought this despite the lousy reviews because so many of them seemed to boil down to ""it's too hard!"" and difficult games are something I really enjoy. There's nothing worse than a too-easy game. Or so I thought until I got this drek and tried it out. There is something worse than a game that's too easy: a game that plays like it's actually DESIGNED to be unwinnable.

I can handle being punished for mistakes I make during game-play and, on the other PQ installments, you'll routinely catch me laughing at myself half a second after I realize the move I just made was so stupid I'm likely to die because of it. But Galactrix is different. It makes me want to throw my DS down the garbage disposal. I like games that are an equal or near-equal mix of random chance and skill/strategy. That random element can make it much harder to win and that's a bonus. But when the laws of probability seem to be actively conspiring to take away anything resembling a fighting chance from the player (time limits, ridiculously hard goals for basic plot-advancing things like moving through the game world, blank blocks that can't be moved OR matched, etc), a line is crossed from ""challenging"" to ""sadistic"".

It's a shame. I liked the idea, I liked the new puzzle board mechanics (hexes rather than squares, pieces that fall in different directions, etc), I liked the mining and item creation mini-games (and, to an extent, the leap-gate hacking even if that becomes frustratingly repetitive after awhile), but every time I played, I felt like the game designer was laughing at my inability to make progress without having to play the same mini-game a million times before circumstances conspired to make it remotely winnable. And that's before I even get into how unbalanced some of the ship improvements make combat.

664,"* Not worth new-release cost!
* Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players.
* Online manual just says ""Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand..."", nothing on how to actually join the game.
* After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in.
* Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. Likely normal. sad. Should be a way to register the game and run the install without the disc.
* Co-op mode is terrible. It should be called something else. It is really just a single player game. If the 2nd player joins and dies. They do not automatically re-spawn, they have to wait for a timer to expire and then press a button to return.
* Camera only follows player 1 and if player 2 goes off the screen, they time out and die. If player 1 dies and player 2 is still alive, it doesn't matter. It acts like both had died and forces you back to a check point.
* For a Sony launch title, the graphics are NOT good. Feels like an older PS3 game.
* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn't good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it's one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it's just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney's Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it's better than Knack.

My pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.

IGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!

If you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.

Remember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it's a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn't good enough for a $60 new-release cost.

UPDATE: I still can't stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it's a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It's not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it's release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.

Many people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that. As my title says, this review is based heavily on the Co-op aspect of the game.",positive

I couldn't get pass the first level. The entire game looks like a huge oil slick was dumped on everything. One can barely make out characters or details because of the ugly color scheme and detail given to everything. The story is cheap and stupid - rather than provide an intriguing storyline and main character, the player is given cuss words and a main character that's about as ugly and filthy as his language. The combo system is clunky, frustrating, and pointless. Hell, the main character should be able to curse everyone out and just walk off. That's how the fight system should've been. Choose the best cuss word and watch what happens.

It's a stupid game developed by stupid people that knew they could cash in easily with the use of strong language that (mostly kids, wink wink) would be shocked at. I'm sure they were pissed with the M+17 rating as this game clearly was not targeting an intelligent, 20yr old+ audience.

676,"The title sums up my sentiments for this game.  A lot of other reviews focus on faults in the plot, a distaste for cutscenes and voice acting, or how this particular installment deviates from traditional Metroid games in a bad way.  Regardless of all that, I think this game is just plain boring.  Every enemy encounter is the same, boss or non-boss; dodge to instantly charge your beam and then fire.  If your beam stops working, shoot missiles.  A few encounters required the grappling beam, but that's it.  Furthermore, the levels are really uninspired.  You can just run straight through them.  There's little room for exploration and even the dang pick-ups are highlighted on the map so you don't have to search for those.  I beat the game with only 36% of the pickups with ease, and did it in under 7 hours on my first and only playthrough.  I went and did the extra chapter at the end in less than an hour and that was mostly getting more pickups (I got up to ~50-60%).  If you get 100% you can unlock hard mode, but by that point I just really didn't care anymore.  Do yourself a favor and save your money for a different game.  There are lots of good titles coming out in the next couple months.  If you need something to do in the meantime find an old classic title and go replay it.",negative

though being able to see them on the field has made making adjustments easier as you can see who's covering who, or wich members of your O-line are gonna plow threw the D easier, it still doesn't justify the price nor the Hype generated for this game.

The rosters are soarly wrong, The Bears still have Tank Johnson, who was released months ago, and replaced by Darwin Walker months ago, and yet this simple fix was not made, i am sure there are other holes in this roster as well.

The menu's and over lays are reused from last year, they just made them bigger and a black, When you score and are about to kick a field goal, you see 1st and 10 at the top in white, over Field Goal in orange, wich was last years lettering at the top.

AI and animations have been improved slightly, not as vastly as EA would lead you to believe, some of the new animations actualy cause gameplay problems where the animation was inapropriat at the time. Some players still walk through others, the running back still stubbornly runs into the o-line untill he trips.

The graphix are tweaked, colors and edges do seem more refigned, but given the Hardware out for PC's, there is no reason why PC gamers are stuck with Ps2/Xbox graphics. easpecialy since even mid range budget cards these days are equal or even better than xbox 360 and ps3.

One bright spot is the hall of fame mode, You can now play as one of the players from this years draft, including this actualy makes me play this aspect now.

The ""Steam"" logo appears nowhere on the box.  If you're not bothered by Steam, Bon Appetit.  If, like me, you refuse to install anything on your hardware that ""reports back"" information - and you can't stop it - you have been warned.

Steam, in my opinion, is spyware.  They are *legal* spyware, since you press the ""I accept"" key without reading what it says.  What it says, of course, is ""we'll gather information from your PC and send it back to VALVe.""

Nothing illegal.  Whether you want to play by these rules, however, is up to you.",negative

701,"This game is terrible.  This is coming from a big fan of the MGS series (you can read my glowing review of Snake Eater for instance).

The camera and the controls are what do the most damage to this game.  Without two analog sticks, controlling the camera without moving is almost impossible (and even if you take two hands or modify the controls to do just that it fights you the entire time making the effort wasted).  needless to say where the camera automatically points is almost never in the direction you're interested in.  The controls pioneered in the second installment of the series are very poorly carried over here.  The aforementioned camera is a huge issue, but the lack of the two shoulder/trigger buttons hurts this game.  A MGS-1 style game probably could have made an excellent PSP game, but alas, they opted for a control scheme not suited to the limitations of the PSP.

The analog nub doesn't ave any speed control to it (not sure if this is the PSP or the game's failure to take advantage of it) making the ""analog"" portion refer to directionality only.  This makes fine-tune aiming difficult, and on a moving target impossible.  (This is further complicated by the low resolution of the PSP).  This means that due to terrible camera and awful handling/controls, both sneaking and gunplay (the only two kinds of gameplay in the game) are tedious and unpleasant affairs.

Even if the controls were perfect, or this was ported on to an actual console, this is still the weakest game in the series.  Level design is obnoxious, (ie 5+ minute long vent crawls with nothing going on is a common feature).  The game repeatedly beats a dead horse with forced repetitious ojectives.

Example of a typical level:
 - Upon beating the previous level you are given a 3 minute dialogue about the next mission objective.  When you select the next mission, you are given roughly the same dialogue about the mission objective again.  Upon entering the mission you immediately get a lengthy raido message about the mission objective again.  Upon entering the room with the objective, it does 20-second cinematic pan of the objective, and you get a radio message about the objective.  Once you approach the objective, you get a radio message about the objective again.  You blow up the objective, and then get a radio conversation about blowing up the objective.  After completing the mission, you then have a dialogue sequence again about how you blew up the objective.

The MGS series is known for being overly verbose, but this game is almost a parody of it.  It's only saving grace is that every second you're in a dialogue means it's one less second you have to be playing with the game's awful controls.

Finally, there's the load time.  Every time one of these dialogue sequences comes up, there's loading.  dialogue sequence ends?  There's loading.  Restart level?  more loading.  I have the PS-Store downloaded version (ie not the mini-disc) which I think would make loading less of an issue.  God help you if you have the mini-disc.

Do yourself a favor: don't ever play this game.",negative

707,"Nintendo has shafted me again, first with a n64 that had no third party support. Now the same thing has happened with my Gamecube. I own all three new systems plus 5 older systems and I work for software etc. I know my business and our sales speak volumes. XBOX sales have picked up while Gamecube sales have dropped. well there is always the next system. For Gamecube I had to buy memory cards, a keyboard, an ethernet adapter, Then I bought an XBOX. Unlimited memory, and the only thing you might have to purchase is a dvd playback kit(which is cheaper than a Gamecube memory card). I own a real dvd player and im not stupid enough to use my console as a primary dvd player. Gamecube doesnt even have this option. This is 2003, 99% of the world doesnt have to use their game console as a dvd player. I found that most of the games on Gamecube are on XBOX except on XBOX they contain extras, far better graphics, sound and some even add online play. While online you can chat in every game, no need for a keyboard. Gamecube only offers 1 game with online play(shame on them).
XBOX has over 235 games available and over 250 for this year alone, so games is not an issue. Finally someone has built a better system then ps2 and Gamecube. ps2 is good, gamecube is better, but the loading times, muddy jaggy graphics, no dolby digital,and now its losing all its exclusives to xbox. ps2 & gamecube exclusives are getting fewer and the ones they have are seeking ways to get their games on other systems. GTAVC for example, rockstar is planning on releasing a side story to gta only for XBOX, so you can expect great graphics and much better gameplay on xbox. With games like Halo 2, Tao feng, Project Gothom 2, Dino Crisis 3, UFC Tapout 2, Dead or Alice Chronos, Brute force, Rallisport 2, Mech Assault,
Unreal Championship, Panzer Draggon Orta, and many more exclusives, the proof is there if you look, developers are putting their best games on XBOX and then dumping the left overs on ps2 and gamecube. The XBOX exclusive games put anything the ps2 or gamecube has done to shame. Halo was released over a year ago and there still has been nothing from ps2 or gamecube that even comes close to the graphics, sound, story and even the online play rocks even though its not offical through xbox live, you have to play through gamespy.

Compared to the beautiful Gameboy Advance translation of Donkey Kong Country, for example, or Mortal Kombat:  Deadly Alliance, and 007 Nightfire looks like it's a game from four computer generations ago.
The graphics wouldn't be a problem if gameplay were a compensation.  Unfortunately, the enemies in this game look like white blobs with vague black eyeholes, the sounds and voices sound like they were recorded with a portable tape recorder, and controls...this game should have been called 007:  Need a Stairmaster, because your 007 moves like he has lead weights attached to him.  It takes about a whole second after pressing forward before your agent starts to move forward, and strafing is nearly pointless because of it.  The control scheme requires that you stand dead still in order to shift your aim, and that is also slow and ponderous.  My thumb hurt after a couple of minutes of dealing with this control scheme, and after hacking through to Level 4, I just gave up.  I happen to value my eyesight and looking at the blobs on the screen wasn't doing my eyes any good.

The graphics remind me of PS1, just so low quality, the game play was incredibly weak and if you can see for yourself it will remind you of a very old video game (graphics wise). Part 1 was hundreds of times better in every way when compared to this version. Sorry to you Sony lovers, I used to be a Sony lover too until the release of the PS4, the quality went downhill, not just this game but so far almost every game released to date for PS4 is prettty wack.
If I am going to pay $400-500 for a video game console, it better be worth it. When sony went from PS1 to PS2 it was a huge step, big jump in graphics and game quality, it was worth the wait for the next console to come out, when PS3 came out, again Son lead the way, big step in gameplay and graphics, so you expect the same based on history when the release of PS4 was announced, but it was a big flop.

Crafting and entertaining basicly has been taken out.  They went from some 30 professions to 9 (7 if you take crafting and entertaining out).  A major reason this game was so enjoyable was that you could do anything you want.  Now, you're stuck into a profession darn near forever.  You can't mix and match like you use to...ext.

720,"Crysis is one of the most tragic stories in PC gaming history.

Crysis original does not have 5 activations on their DRM, but was lacking in gameplay. It had some really awesome moments and was just waiting for an expansion pack to come and better it.

Crysis warhead had intense action in awesome environments coupled with highly detailed levels and more character personality, but it also has the nasty draconian DRM known as securom. This means that you cannot resell the game when you're done, nor can you buy one copy and play LAN games. If you have a little brother that wants to join you, or a dad and brother, expect to pay full price per seat.

If you're creative and have trustworthy friends, you can lend crysis warhead to a friend just fine, which is how I played it. There are many less breathtaking moments, and stealth is no longer your priority, but you can't just blindly shoot places up.

Unfortunately, because of piracy IN RESPONSE TO the anti-piracy/DRM measures, crytek has decided to compromise the quality and integrity of their games and work on porting their next crysis/cryengine games to console. The difference is immense, and Crysis is as good as it will get for PC gamers as far as utilizing system resources for at least another 6 months.

Pros:
-Very awesome physics
-Very awesome graphics that make console graphics fanboys cry
-Some interesting gameplay dynamics
-For an FPS in this day and age, interesting AI

Cons:
-Downright nasty DRM measures on warhead and wars.
-Psuedo-open environments, you are on a linear path, always.
-Exploration is rarely rewarded when it can be done
-Developer has added injury to insult, and after alienating most of its PC customers claimed that the piracy is too much for them. Sales numbers at the time were 1.5 million copies sold, 350,000 copies downloaded. Sales numbers now are 4.5 million copies sold, 800,000 copies pirated.
-Sequels will be using console-ified graphics and gameplay that won't be worth your time. For now Crysis has an interesting storyline told wonderfully by the game engine, but this will change.

Bottom line: Buy this 3 pack when it hits 29.99 or lower, buy sequels at 19.99 or lower, but not a penny more.",positive
721,"Installing the downloaded version of the game NBA 2K14, with Steam, from Amazon was a nightmare!

I can't even comment on the game play because I can't even get into the game! It just keeps going around in circles. I purchased X Box 360 for the PC controllers for 2K games (because my Logitech Game pad controllers never worked with previous 2K games).

Once after fiddling endlessly with non responsive controls and keyboard presses, I actually got a game to start!
Of course then I couldn't control the players! I had gone to the controller setup and wrote down the game pad controls but controlling anything was just an ordeal and I just gave up in frustration!

I played all the NBA Live versions from 95 - 2008 with no install or controller problems (but EA Sports betrayed PC users and ended the series on the PC).  If I want to play basketball or baseball I have to play the last EA Sports versions for the PC.  The 2K versions (this is my third) just do not work even after buying the X Box controllers.

All I want to do is play a game against a present human (not online) or against the CPU, but these 2K Games, refuse to work on my PC ( A very expensive Dell 8300 purchased last year running Windows 7 Ultimate  64Bit ).

I have been using computers for over thirty years and I have rarely if ever, had so many problems, with any PC software (including games) as I have had with 2K Sports games!

Steam is a real pain in the neck! It's always updating when I turn on the computer or when I am shutting down! I feel as if I am renting this game instead of owning it .  Why so many endless steps to even install the game? This is the most convoluted game setup I have ever seen in all my years.

Does anyone else have all these controller issues with 2K Sports PC games? I have totally given up on 2K Sports games!

731,"Some of you might be wondering why I am giving this game such a bad review. I have been playing the Sims games since the first games in the franchise beginning with games like Sim Tower, Sim Farm and the first The Sims game came out between 1990 and 2000, and to be clear other than in the sheer quality of the game I am not comparing it to any of them.

Initially I liked this game. The traits helped me create quirky Sims and the open neighborhood was great. I was less than impressed with some of the graphics- lets be realistic while the hood may be great even with a great graphics card mine is a top of the line Nvidia G Series - (one of the best listed in the Specs for the G Series, and I have a 500 GB hard drive, and 4 GB RAM and a 17 inch monitor so that is not the issue) and all my settings on high, the Sims themselves are not so great.

Than EA released their first patch 1.27. At this point I was playing without Mods or CC because there wasn't much out there frankly. The patch was supposed to deal with some issues like the Story Progression that was broken in base game and disappearing inventory items. It didn't, I had to reinstall my game. This pattern has continued throughout patches 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5/1.6.

Recently I purchased World Adventures, removed all my CC and Mods (what few I use cause I don't like cheating) deleted cache files, etc Standard Operating Procedure for installing patches and Expansions in games where there are fan created content and game modifications available. I go to start up the game- patched, newly installed EP, and absolutely no CC/Mods whatsoever, and my lots have disappeared and turned blue, all premade Sims are now homeless, and my Sims cannot interact with NPC""s, premades, or each other. They also cannot go to work, and all car pools and taxis have disappeared.

I tried uninstalling both the base game and World Adventures and putting the last patch to remotely work (1.3) in place for my game and started up the game again with no CC/Mods- which resulted in my not being able to save at all or to use CAS to make Sims, or to access premade Sims on their lots in order to play them. These issues were reported to EA customer service who told me that I needed a better computer ( uhmm well there isn't much better I could get unless I went out a bought a $6000 computer with my own server to boot). Sorry EA the problems with this game are your fail - not mine.

I uninstalled. I will not be reinstalling.

Let me put this simply. This game is poor quality. I never had this type of problems with either Sims 1 or Sims 2, with any of the Expansion or Stuff Packs, or with any of the patches. I will not purchase any further expansions or stuff packs for Sims 3. I also will not be buying any of Electronic Arts other games.

736,"Sorely disappointed with this game.

Disgraceful launch by Ubisoft.

I have been unable to play this game past the basic intro because of a stupid glitch that prevents you from completing a required task.  You are supposed to step up to what looks like a laptop and ""sign in"" and ""authorize your agent"".  What happens is that in Ubisofts infinite wisdom they decided to make this an online only game so you get dumped into a ""safehouse"" with 20 other players and you are all trying to use that laptop at the same time but for some reason this causes a glitch that prevents anyone from completing this stupid required task to continue.  Mind you this is like 5 mins into the game, if that.  I spent 1.5 hrs restarting, signing out and in, rebooting........all for nothing.  I cannot advance past this.  For a game with so much ""beta"" play this is disgraceful.  If its any indication of how the rest of this game is going to go I doubt I will bother playing much more.

Even with so little game play, I did get to do the basic intro and I immediately noticed a game breaking flaw in the basic design of this game.  The stealth combat system is terrible.  This game was advertised as a stealthy type combat game where you use cover a lot and use stealth, firepower and deployment tactics to surprise and overwhelm your enemies.  The cover system in this game is a gigantic step backwards.  There  have been games made 15 years ago that had better cover systems.  YOU CANNOT CROUCH OR SNEAK AT ALL.  unless you are next to a ""cover"" object and then ""x"" button enter cover.  Stupid.  Its like a cheap android game.  Its laughable that they even considered this much less approved it.

Maybe this will get better, but I don't see how.  Once I can actually play it some, I will update this review.  I wish there was an option for zero stars because I have a feeling that the 1 star is going to be too much.

Update:

After playing this for several hours I am updating this review.

Good:

I like the graphics.  Seem very authentic to me.
Audio sounds great too.
I like the idea of loot and having more control over char building in a shooting game.
I like the story line or at least the idea of it but they need to deliver it better.  I don't feel invested in it.

Bad:
The stealth or lack thereof is still in my mind a major flaw.
This game feel like a bad version of a Gears of War game mixed with a bad rpg.  They really wind up missing the mark on both.
The open world is just an illusion.  Really the open world is nothing more than a transport medium to get you from 1 linear encounter to the next.
I can play farming games with the best.  I spent years doing it on Diablo II.  I just don't enjoy doing it with this game.  Trash mob after trash mob with the occasional OP boss.  I don't know why this is boring when in other games it isn't.  It must be the blah loot.
I have had several glitches that break my playing.  Goes to load and get stuck at some percent.  Dropped from network while playing. Can't log in.  Annoying.  No reason for games to have these problems with so much beta testing.

I wish I hadn't bought this game.  I can see some promise in it, but they have a lot of work to do...too much in fact.",negative
737,"I got this game after listening to everyone say how great it is, and after my experience with Halo 2, which was ok. This game is basically very stupid, because all you do is jump around all day, and you can't zoom in on a lot of guns, shooting at midget things. Basically OK graphics, OK online, and the hammer is just plain gay. Overall, don't get this game, there are MUCH better games out there, don't waste your time and buy into the fan base hype.

Well, SONY RUSHED the console, to release it BEFORE the XBOX ONE, that's why so MANY PS4 CONSOLE are FAULTY, BUGGY AND CRAPPY!
Just google Blue light of Death!!
A LOT of PS4 games are also DELAYED, (DriveClub etc.)

- most PS4s just don't turn on, when you play it for more than an hour!
- most PS4s are DEAD RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!!!!
- PSN, the online service, is just a MESS AND BUGGY! It doesn't work! You only get ERROR-MESSAGES!
- Also, games don't work and crash a LOT!
- the browser is also just a MESS and can't render a lot of websites!
- the whole UI is so crappy, doesn't work at all!! It always crashes and brings your back to the home!

You are the customer and you should not PAY for this crap, just to be a BETA TESTER! This is just PATHETIC!

Get an XBOX ONE instead! It works perfectly!

747,"Trust me on this, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare has bad spawns in the multi player, hacking, too much exo jumping making them harder to hit and take out on regular team death match, the maps are too small meaning that once you spawn when you die, you are going to die in a matter of seconds 50% to 90% of the time, spawn trapping meaning the enemy team knows where your spawn points are and camp, it is hard to hear foot steps, also, on the regular matches everyone runs a bal 27, ak12, and asm1 meaning the sub machine guns are weak, on  tdm (team death match) people camp in corners, noob tubes with danger close goes through flak jacket one hit kill 90% of the time, lag, you shoot first get hit markers the enemy shoots second and you feel like you died by one bullet, people have a tendency to talk trash to other players, and if you are not running a hd tv with hdmi cables the grapichs are butt ugly and you will be seeing dark spots or areas on the map where enemies can blend in the darkness like Batman.

754,"Zelda is the most over rated game series ever made. And Wind Waker is the worst Zelda game made. First of all i will just start talking about how bad the graphics are. What we are looking at here are 2D Pixel Shaded Graphics. I can possibly understand these graphics for a racing game, or possibly a fighting game. BUT NOT AN ADVENTURE GAME. Yes Ocarina of time was OK, but not good enough to save this series. Wind Waker completly destroyed it. Link looks and talks like a complete loser. But you may say graphics aren't everything. I can agree with that SOMETIMES, but when they are as horrific as these, i cant even play the game. Now the story and gameplay. Can u hit Z and press the A button multiple times? Well then you can beat Zelda Wind Waker. The game is meant for kids, no doubt about that. There is a talking Ship FFS. What is going on here nintendo?!?!

756,"This is a game that only a die-hard fan of the board game could even possibly love.  Flat out, I have nothing nice to say about this game.  I gave it six hours and during that time I did not enjoy one single aspect of the game.

The game is a technical disaster.  The graphics and sound are about as low a quality as you can get.  The in-game tutorial is utterly worthless.  I did not bother with the real time play, but the turn by turn play is painfully slow - even by turn by turn standards.  Every dialog is slow, every interaction is slow, and it is painful to watch the opposing AI think and play.

I tried my hand at one team, then the other.  I figured I was not understanding how to play the team, so as I played one team I watched the computer AI play the other.  Having discerned basic tactics for that kind of team, I tried my hand.  Failure, utter failure.  I even tried a campaign, setting up various teams, and trying various races.  Same result.

It almost feels like the dice are rigged, which seems ridiculous, but that is how it feels.  As I played one team I repeatedly failed to pick up the ball, losing my turn.  I repeatedly got knocked down running passed enemies.  Most of the time when attempting to throw the ball, it was fumbled.  It was ridiculous.  I switched teams, and watched the opposing AI do mostly everything on the first try.  It was very infuriating.  This was not an isolated incident.  This happened for the entire six hours.

There may be a game there to play, but it doesn't seem to be worth pursuing.  I am a huge Warhammer 40k fan and so I decided to buy this game, if nothing else, to support Gamesworkshop somehow.  Sadly, I regret that decision.  This was (...)wasted.  Perhaps if you are super die-hard fan of the board game and you feel like watching very poor animation you may find the game of worth, but even then I would highly doubt it.

For those of us who value our time, I recommend passing on this game.  If you feel like flogging yourself for hours with a frustrating game, then have at it.  Yes, I am rating the game low because I did not do well at it.  I also rated it low because it is of overall poor quality, and was not fun.  In my opinion, a failure for a game.",negative

764,"I was really excited to get my hands on this newest expansion pack in the Sims 2 franchise.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.

I'm running Windows XP with more than one gigabyte of memory, which (according to the requirements on the box) should be more than enough.  It isn't.  I experienced the worst slow-down in loading times.  Even ""Pets"" wasn't this bad!  To load the game took nearly five minutes.  To load the neighbourhood took another five.  Then it was another couple of minutes to load a lot.  I thought that my custom content was perhaps slowing things down.  So I got rid of all of it.  I didn't notice any difference.  I can't imagine trying to run this expansion pack with the recommended minimum 512 megabytes of RAM.  I'm not sure the game would ever even load.

I took my Sims on two vacations.  For the first, I took a single woman to Twikkii Island.  I noticed how slow it was right away.  With all the other Sims wandering around these vacation lots, there's bound to be a bit of lag.  I had her visit the beach.  It rained and the gameplay grew even slower.  I had her visit some ancient ruins.  The game slowed almost to a stop when she encountered a hot springs (it must've been the steam animation).  It was just too much for my computer.  Plus, each time my Sim walked to another lot, there were more minutes of loading time.

For the second vacation, I took a couple and their child to the mountain vacation destination.  By this time, the loading times were really starting to annoy me.  I only had them visit one other lot, and I made the mistake of having the mother and daughter play on the log roll.  The mother got completely stuck, and I had to look up how to free her using the debugging tool.  A search of the BBS on the official site shows that I am not the only one to experience this problem.

I didn't bother having my Sims visit the Far East destination.  By the time I got my poor glitched family back from their vacation, I'd had enough.

The developers seem to be using their customers as beta testers.  That's fine if they tell you that.  But when I buy an expansion pack for my favourite game, I don't want to have to avoid certain gameplay experiences until a patch is released.  These issues - if they are as common as they appear to be - should have been addressed before the games were finalized and shipped.

I've uninstalled ""Bon Voyage"".  I'll go back to playing with the setup I had before.  And I'll seriously think twice before wasting my money on the next piece of memory-hogging garbage that's released under the Sims 2 brand.",negative
765,"I played a friend's copy, which he actually returned when he learned about the draconian DRM and limited licensing and installs.

Forget about buying a game like this.  Apparently, it's easy enough to pirate, although I do not advocate it or do it.  Aside from being free, the version you can download from a BitTorrent site isn't crippled with horrendous DRM.  Yep, if you're honest, you will NOT get what you pay for.  If you steal it, you'll love it.  Keep in mind that Bioware actually paid a lot for this DRM that taints their game and doesn't even slow down piracy.  Wow.  That's just plain silly.

Until software makers finally realize that punishing paying customers isn't a good business strategy, BitTorrent and P2P sites will continue to thrive.  The DRM doesn't even slow down piracy.  It just reeeeally irritates the honest folks who expect to own something they pay for.

It's like buying a TV that will stop working if you move it around the room more than 3 times.  Oh, and of course you can't sell the TV to anyone else.  Oh, and you have to have an Internet connection to get it to turn on...every time.  Oh, and it may mess up your cable box, DVD player and stereo if it thinks you are trying to repair it.

And if you smack the wall you get to hear ""little damage done"", but if you try to steer straight the car pulls hard to the side because it's @#$@% up !  It's not ""little damage"".  Even demolition driving a car, it's so hard to control I CAN'T EVEN INTENTIONALLY HIT ANOTHER CAR because it slides so much.  Avoid this game at all cost, I wasted $15.

780,"I'll admit this game has good graphics, but that's about it.  The rest of it I totally hated.

The reason I bought ""Grid"" was that it had garnered enough reviews on Metacritic to earn the place of the most favorably-reviewed racing game for the Playstation.  After having played it for weeks I wonder how many hours those reviewers actually played it.

For me, at least, the thing was unwinnable.  It was so difficult as to be ridiculous, even on ""Basic"" difficulty.  I like to come home from work and want to unwind for an hour or so with a racing game.  This seemed as good as any other, but after a few weeks passed, I noticed that I wasn't making any progress in the game, since I wasn't winning any races.

This is because:

1.  All the camera angles are so low that you can't really see much of the road ahead of you.  Therefore to avoid crashing you are forced to travel at speeds slower than those necessary to win even the simplest races.  As a result, the only way to really win a race is, essentially, to memorize the track.  But this strikes me as boring and not unlike memorizing maze patterns in Pac-Man.

2.  The physics of the game are completely absurd.  Since when do cars invariably and eternally speed out of control because you floor it when you're on grass or gravel?  I have a car and do that from time to time:  my car does not spin in absurd circles when I do.  The physics of the game and the interaction with other cars was all convincing and realistic until you got off the track.  When you did, Bizarro World rules suddenly same into play.

First off, If you plan on hacking you're Wii, like me, don't buy this package. It's a black Wii so it's not 100% brick proof. What you're gonna want is the first model, the white 2006 model, not to be confused with the white 2010/2011 model. If you've never thought about hacking your Wii, you may want to look into it. A hacked Wii is about the most powerful and flexible gaming system I've ever seen. When it's hacked, it's abilities make it blow the PS3/360 completely out of the water. Also, don't think I'm encouraging anything illegal. There IS such a thing as a legal way to hack, and I for one own a white Wii which is hacked, and a black Wii from the Mario Kart Bundle which isn't hacked, so yes I still buy ALL my games legally.

Now for the part that REALLY upsets me. After all these years of the Wii being known to have GameCube controller ports and GameCube memory cards slots, how can you POSSIBLY release a Wii that has NEITHER, and NOT tell your consumers? This has been a very manipulative move on Nintendo's part, taking advantage of the trust of their customers, purposefully. It's advertised like any other Wii, and looks exactly like the Wii from the Mario Kart Bundle, when it's not, it's completely different. So if you had a Wii before and played all your old Gamecube games but then something went wrong causing you to need a new one, you'd walk into a store or order this, only to find out after getting home that you've just wasted time AND money. What's even worse is that in an attempt to rid themselves of their own guilty conscience, AND try to soften you up a bit after knowing you're gonna be completely angry with this deal, they slide in a stupid copy of New Super Mario Bros Wii, as if that could make up for you being totally ripped off! I've always defended Nintendo when it came to putting their customers first so this is a shocking disappointment to me and everyone else who ever has! It's time to shape up Nintendo! This behaviour is unbecoming of you!",negative

795,"Downloaded from Steam, running on Intel DuoCore 3.16GHz, Windows 7 Home 32bit with 4Gb RAM, 1.5 Tb Hard drive and GTC295 video card with 2Gb graphics memory.

This is the first, and the last, Rockstar game I will ever buy. Thank god I didn't pay much for it. To start with, before they will let me play I have to join some stupid Social Club and give my email address - good luck spamming me on the email address I gave you Rockstar. Screw that. Then I had to wait for a patch even though I had only just downloaded it. After the patch was installed I got some bogus error message that I had no driver installed, so I restarted Steam. It took almost ten minutes from launch to actual game play. And I was barely getting 2fps with my processor pegged at 100%. The graphics aren't that great. I even dumbed down the resolution and textures to no avail. My graphics card is perfectly capable of handling anything I throw at it so I have to assume the bottleneck is my cpu. So we have to have a QuadCore to play this game. This sucks!

Update: I loaded this onto my XPS QuadCore and it's playable although there is still noticable lag. If it ran well on a computer costing less that $1500 I'd give it three stars.

It's still a bad port with major playability issues. Driving is very difficult with most vehicles having a turn radius larger than a four lane road. Moving in cover is awkward because the same key that is used to toggle in and out of cover is the same key that does special moves while in cover. Consequently Cole will sometimes come out of cover and run into the open while under fire with obvious results.

The good graphics are reserved for the stars of the game - the automobiles. This is the best part of the game - seeing and driving these beauties.

800,"This game is completely terrible. There are no redeeming qualities to it. Two Worlds 2, the sequel to Two Worlds (or is it One World 2) is one of the worst games to grace this generation of gaming.

To start, Two Worlds (1) was a terrible game to begin with and an even worse port to the Xbox. It's surprising that they even got enough money to make the sequel. If you want a better gaming experience than Two Worlds 2 however, play Two Worlds online with a friend because that's all there is.

Two Worlds 2 did so many things wrong. From a bad story to a terrible questing system, Two Worlds looks shiny and new, but you can't cover up the horrible failure that it is.

You may think I'm being hard on this game, but trust me, I played through the entire thing. It tested my patience, and my sanity.",negative
801,Okay the first thing i noticed with this game is there is hardly any lighting effect even when i adjusted it. the tank you first encounter looks like its made out of card board from what i could see of it. (due to lighting.) The AI is retarded most of the enemys run into walls. and keep running. the first medal of honor for playstation 1 is better than this peice of garbage. and the american M1 garand your allies have is semi automatic but they work it like a bolt action rifle. thats what the Germans use. And thats if your lucky to even get them to shoot back at the enemy. The last thing i noticed was the phisycs are broken. I shot this german and he floats into the air and disapeers WTF! and my friend who also played this game experianced the same thing. and this was a brand new game i didn't rent it. i bought it from walmart. and after that i sold it to gamestop for 20$.

I'm more of an Assassins Creed player. Not much into shooters. I like GTA, GOW and stuff like that but I just cannot bring myself to finish or even play this game again.

Microsoft's customer service is terrible and they never send you a new console only used ones that from my expierence have been in terrible condition (stains and broken parts of the case).

In fact you can easily pop the inside components out with some slight pressure and examine the electronics. No switch or button anywhere on the circuit board. I wonder if some people think they are seeing 1080p when it's actually 480p. Maybe other sellers are not selling knock-offs and maybe J-Tech is. Maybe J-Tech doesn't realize what they're selling. I am not one of those lucky people who may have received a functioning 1080p unit. Now J-Tech wants me to pay for return shipping with tracking and upon receipt and examination they will issue a refund.

819,"Rarely will you find any good reviews on this game and to be fair, I read the reviews and knew full well what awaited me. However I assumed that I could power through the grind and things would improve once you became king of the monsters. But no the grind is tedious, slow, and offers very little satisfaction when it is finished.

To put it simply, you really gotten love godzilla to power through this grind. The monsters move like lumbering construction equipment with a huge  delay in their reaction times. Movement itself has been divided into three button mash up for no reason. The cities are empty and vold of people. There isn't even a destruction mode to take out your frustration. But the worst thing about this game however is that graphically, this had the potiential to be welcome refreash to the classic monster rampage genre. Music and sound effects were good too. The monsters have a great design and pay a great tribute to the movies but as far as being a depiction of what it would be like to rampage across a city, it fails pitifully from the very start.

This is why I ask how do you screw up Godizlla? His name alone should be all the inspiration one needs to make a truely epic gaming experience and yet somehow what we have here is slow, tedious, and boring grind.",positive

Camera angle sometimes changes by itself...especially when I need to face the enemies, not have my back toward them. Ammo is too limited for the number of enemies to kill. I have to use the knife a lot of the time, and you have to hold L2 all the time to have it equipped. Why can't you do just a one-time toggle like other games?

823,"Yes, this game has now been on the market ~5/6 months now and I feel that enough patches and hotfixes have been programmed to rough out some of the edges of this game. I'd like to touch base on the campaign and multiplayer separately:

The Campaign:
Somewhat unique. After completing a campaign level, the player is granted the ability to customize their starting loadout for that particular campaign level.
Example - you can now play through the same level again, but starting with extended mags on your primary weapon. We've seen this before in some other shooters, but at least it allows for some replay value. Overall the campaign is not very engaging. The story is just plain bland.

The Multiplayer:
More or less this is the same multiplayer as always. The pick ten system is the newest addition. It simply allows for further customization of one's class setup.
Some good strides have been made to make this game more balanced. With a series of hotfixes and patches, previously overpowered class setups have now been weakened to create an even playing field.
Other areas where Trearch has failed this game are in the lag, spawn and probation systems. I do understand that lag is not an easy fix. There are many factors and variables involved. The spawn and probabtion systems are easy fixes and Trearch has done nothing to fix them.
The probation system puts players on probation for 1:00, 5:00 or 10:00. This means that they can not join a multiplayer game for said amount of time due to the following reasons I've noticed: getting booted from a pregame lobby, leaving a game early, the host quits, you turn off your system and go to work during a game :(

Overall:
I'd give this game 1.3/5 stars. Good for some entertainment, but Trearch needs to fix lag, spawns and the probabtion system for this to even be a 3 star worthy game.",positive
824,"This headset is having the same issue my Xbox 360 A40 headset has had. I regret paying for the first pair. The product itself is great... only if you can get the cables from not shutting off half of your audio from normal wear and tear (for example, moving your head). It is a cabling scheme by Astro. Buy the headset, and pay overpriced costs on their cables. Cables that indefinitely break and I have had no better experience. I have cheaper electronics that never have a wiring / connectivity issue. This is not sufficient for the price. It doesn't seem like anything has changed from Astro company at all. I am really disappointed because when they do work, they work great. But again, I'm not buying new cables for the next two years. I shouldn't be hearing audio cut in and out on new cables.

Knowing they don't have any games involving motorcycles thought okay they can have even though it is rated M. Well that should have been a clue to look closer but they have lots of games with that rating and while I don't love the language or all the violence it hasn't made them antisocial. When my 16 year old got it he was thrilled but I came downstairs after he started playing and he and his brothers all said it sucked (their words). I sat and watched and it was so boring all you do is ride a motorcycle and hit the other rider with a wrench over and over again. Then he beat up some girls lousy boyfriend and his friends but it wasn't much of a challenge as no one fights back at all. The final straw was when she began to thank him in a most inappropriate way it was off with the game and straight to the trash. Honestly if it weren't my fault for buying this I would demand my money back as it was really boring not to mention foul. Please don't waste your money on this,neutral
833,"I had high hopes for the Venus mouse.  First off the packaging is nice, still smiling at this point.  The mouse also feels pretty darn good in my hand.  Comfortable and ergonomic enough. After getting through a bit of the Chinglish (poorly written English, from China) I got the mouse installed and working.  This is where things start to get bad.

The smooth plastic footing was stuck on crooked and was peeling up in two places.  Not a huge deal as they provide a replacement with the mouse.  The tuning weights were also not included with my mouse.  There is a black container but not metal weights in it or the mouse.  :(

The most important thing for a gaming mouse (imho) is the ability to track well as well as programmable buttons for MMO.  The list of features, and price, look good but the tracking is pretty bad.  I am using an expensive gaming mouse pad and thought this might be the problem.  I tried it on a wooden desk and also with a plain black mouse pad.  Long story short there is significant lag and jittery movement.  I restarted my gaming rig, I tried re-installing the software, etc... It would work well for 20-60 seconds and then the cursor would hop around.  I have a hard time believing this is true 16,400 DPI.  I have no way of figuring this out.  If it is a true 16,400 DPI mouse it must be using an inexpensive sensor.

Sadly the tracking issues are bad enough that I can't use this mouse for gaming let alone daily use.",positive
834,"Great marketing ploy; throw millions of dollars on sticking your game on every billboard, social media and TV ad and you have the makings of a next-gen classic guys! Witcher 3 is Fable made 10 years later with more RPG elements, trying to follow in the footsteps of Skyrim mixing in GTA . Teenage boys everywhere (who are not allowed to buy this game BTW) are screaming ""10/10 THE BEST GAME EVER MAAANNNNNN!!!!!! OMG 200 HOURZ OF FETCH QUESTS 4 LIFE!!!""

This game has so much swearing and profanity it's the new poster game for teens (who aren't allowed to buy the game BTW). It uses the c-word which is used almost as much as the f-bomb in the 90's so is a pathetic attempt at gaining controversy. The combat is a disgrace consisting of attack, dodge, attack, dodge, retreat, level up, return and smash everyone, rinse and repeat. Maybe if they included harder and more complex combat it would be worth more. No battle is ever won through skill, just grind for hours and laugh as enemies are dispatched with ease. Enemies are so stupid that blocking causes the AI to just hit your sword rather than rip your guts out EVERY SINGLE TIME.

No doubt people who have only started playing games five years ago are going to love this and tell everyone who isn't giving this 5/5 rude words they heard for the first time in this VERY GAME. Really sad.

The graphics are just AWFUL. The Fable reboot and it isn't that far off this garbage visually, and it wasn't even that good. Pretty shades of green worked for that game in 2004 too.

The Aidiots can telesteal everything and are awarded kills when they don't even fire their weapons.  This is a pathetic, garbled mess for 60 dollars and is obviously unsupported by EA or Valve.  The game is a mere update to L4D 1 as it is but this is a rip off. Get the PC version and with the PC version the DLC (as little as it is), is free.  The PC version has bug fixes from what I can tell ,better graphics and more extended multiplayer...this verison however seems like a lazy, broken, unsupported, unfinished demo or beta version it sucks.

The characters and environments look blocky and lack any detail. The graphics are so bad they even make the game difficult - it's hard to tell which direction you're going because everything starts to look the same.
The gameplay is mediocre. Running seems slow and awkward, rather than speedy and fluid. The gunfire is interesting - the weapons really kick, so aiming is more realistic. Otherwise SOF plays just about like any other first person shooter.
This game is touted for its ""realistic"" weapons damage. Hitting different parts of enemies' bodies results in different body parts being blown off. Call me crazy, but I don't think sadistic violence can make up for a poorly designed and executed game. At any rate, you have to be really close to even notice, so it's not a big deal.

The only difference would be an update in graphics.  This however was sadly a huge lie.  Also I was promised the ability to create custom play lists, also a lie.  The game comes with pre made play lists but there is no possibility to create your own.  Also there is no ability to play say ""big team battle halo 2""  You can play a halo 2 play list or a big team battle play list that includes all 4 games there are no deeper options.  Also nearly all of the customizable feature from halo 3 are gone.  You can choose Spartan or elite, and you can pick a base armor and 2 colors but the original allowed for armor, helmet and 3 colors.  Halo 2 anniversary mp has very few maps and most of them aren't even the popular ones.  To top it all off the ""multi kill"" voice has been changed entirely constantly spamming ""protect your flag"" every couple of seconds that someone has your flag.  Single player is completely whacked out as well.  First all the controls have to manually be set to play like their originals or you will be playing with the halo 4 control scheme on all games. Not a deal breaker but there are much deeper issues.  The enemy AI is much different than it used to be.  Elites rarely care to find cover instead preferring to charge at you guns blazing.  This is especially true if your shields are low.  Load areas that used to be fixed and allow you to bypass enemies have been changed.  And even the physics of the game just seem a bit off.  All in all this was a huge disappointment.

864,"Day one:  I am on my way to Game Stop, and I am on the BRINK of picking up my copy of the game for 60 bucks plus tax.  I am really excited, this game is going to be so much fun.  Bethesda has created some of my favorite games, including the Fall Out games.  I get home and pop my copy into my XBOX 360 and the story boots up.  Not bad, I get to create my own character and this is going to be so much fun!  I start playing the campaign, and I feel as though there is some mistake.  Single Player is playing exactly like multiplayer.  I'm on the BRINK of wondering if I accidentally started a multi player campaign.  Nope!!!  Oh well, lets see what this game is all about. I play for about an hour, and I just cannot find any really good qualities in the game.  Now I am on the BRINK of getting a little worried.  Did I just shell out 60 clams to play this piece of junk game?  I shut down, and take the gamers walk of shame to my bedroom and retire for the night.

Day two:  Maybe I was wrong Yesterday, today is going to be a better day.  I resume my single player campaign and I start to realize that I am on the BRINK of throwing my controller through the television.  This game is actually worse today than I thought yesterday.  Maybe I am being Punked, but where is Ashton Kutcher?  I play on, and begin to have the sensation of being sucker punched in the balls.  Punked has been over for years, this is the real deal.  God, why has thee forsaken me?  I am on the BRINK of losing my temper.  I turn off the game and begin to think about the 4 hours of my life which were wasted on this game.  I won't ever get them back.  Then I begin to think about the 60 clams I gave to Game Stop for absolutely no reason at all.  I am now on the BRINK of crying.  All hope has been lost, I need help......fast.  I go back to Game Stop to trade my game in, and I am given 24 bucks for it.  At least all was not lost.  On the way home, I wonder how this abomination made it to a console. I may have got some of my money back, but my pride will not heal so easily.  I get home and decide to erase all evidence that this game was ever on my X BOX in the first place.  I'm done, I'm requesting extraction.  Hotel, Eagle, Lima. Pa Pa.-----HELP!!!!! I am on the BRINK of losing my mind.  HQ. re-call the e-vac, I am too ashamed to be rescued.  I'm popping the pink again, but this time drop a J-Dam on me. Please God, if you are out there, make it fast.  I am on the BRINK of insanity.

Day 3: Back to Call of Duty and the rest of the best, I guess I should wait next time.  Then I could read all of the reviews about a game before I buy it.  I feel a little better today, apparently I am not the only one who went insane.  However, there are a few people huffing gasoline or super glue  who gave this game a 5 star rating.  Really, can you be serious or do you work for Bethesda?  I am pretty sure it is the latter.  There are even people out there giving this game a 5 on the PS3, and that is with the entire Sony network being down.  How can you rate a game meant for multi player on the single player alone?  Oh, I forgot, Bethesda employs lots of people.  Now I am on the BRINK of taking a copy of this game and using it as a rectal dilator for whoever wrote positive reviews in the press for this game.

917,"I've played this game through three times completely, to 100% -- although once I was cheating.

I can tell you this:  it's far better on the PC, assuming you have a fast system.

The PS3 version is a disaster for several reasons:

1.  The loading times are long and frequent!  Get ready to spend a long time staring at a black screen.
2.  The mechanics of the Playstation controller work against you.  For example, when you are about to take down a warchief, one of the things you can do on a computer is unload all of your arrows into his head from a distance.  Then, when his health is about half down, you close in for combat.  But you aren't able to do this with a PS controller:  your right thumb is far less precise than a computer mouse, so you'll only be able to get about 2 or 3 shots in before your focus is exhausted.
3.  ""Last chance"" events are super easy on the PC.  You're going to miss a lot of them on PS3 because the cursor moves a lot slower.  I know you can go into the options to adjust ""camera sensitivity,"" but if you do, every time your character turns his head around the world whips around, disorienting you.  You don't have this problem on the PC.
4.  The graphics are not as good on the PS3 as they are on the PC.
5.  The button combos are much trickier on the PS3 to handle well, for advanced moves.  For example, if you want to sneak up on a prisoner to release him or a flower to pick it, you're sneaking with your forefinger on R2.  But you have to lift your forefinger from R2 to R1 to actually release the prisoner or pick the flower.  During this split second, your character stands up and you can be seen by enemies.  I've died many times this way.  On the computer, it's much easier:  there's no conflict between LSHIFT and LCTRL. (Even if there was, you could remap it.)  One solution is to play with your middle finger on R2 to sneak about, reserving one's forefinger for R1, but this feels unnatural to me.
6.  There are some things you can do on the PC version that you simply aren't allowed to do on the PS3 version, even leaving aside the awkward layout of the controls.  An example is sneaking up behind an Uruk and holding him.  On the PC, you can sneak up to him and move into the hold seamlessly.  On the PS3, though, this is not permitted, so your character must stand up for about a second before he is allowed to hold the Uruk.  During this second though, the Uruk frequently gets a whack at you.

The essential, unfixable, unworkaroundable problem with this game on the PS3 is this:  it is too much for the system's resources.  The graphics -- and the fact that the game does not scruple to load 20 orcs simultaneously to attack you -- tax the PS3's resources beyond what they were purposed to endure.  The effect of this is that frequently when you push triangle or square when set upon by enemies on all sides, the game won't register it, or register it in time.  The CPU is simply too busy.  Thus you're frequently going to miss many blocks and ""last chance"" saving throws that someone sitting next you to can plainly see you hit in time.

All of these reasons mean that the game ends up being FAR HARDER on Playstation 3.

After losing a tiny spring and spending hours looking for it, I finally swap one out of PS3 controller, put everything back together, and now my controller doesn't stay on.  I've worked on it for 3 days, and still nothing.  I have a worthless heap of plastic now.

923,"I absolutely loved the POP games for Playstation 2. Super fun combination of fighting and acrobatics. Kind of like God Of War meets Spiderman. So naturally I was excited for this new game. Boy was I disappointed.

This game is truly awful. Not only is it boring, tedious and uninspired, but it ruins a really great series that I loved. The fighting system is the worst thing I have ever played. There are sporadic bad guys to fight, maybe one every five minutes, and EVERY ONE OF THEM IS EXACTLY THE SAME. They might look different, but they act the same, fight the same and never die (they just jump away and you see them 10 minutes later again). There are three fighting moves you can do. Yes, just three! And every fight is exactly the same. Hit him with the sword, dodge his attack, he gets all spooky magical, throw him in the air and slam him down, REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT. I wouldn't expect this bad of fighting engine from a PopCap web game from five years ago. What happened to the fun fighting hack-n-slash goodness from the first three games? I guess they felt they needed to concentrate on the other aspect of the game, which is equally boring and repetitive...

So, after you beat a bad guy your little dumb sidekick girlfriend does some magical BS to the floor and converts that area into a ""healed land"". That means that you get to turn into Super Mario and run around collecting coins for a half hour! Sure, the challenge of climbing around, jumping off stuff and being a crazy wall runner is interesting the first or second time, but it soon becomes apparent that THIS IS THE POINT OF THE ENTIRE GAME. TO RUN AROUND AND COLLECT LIGHT SPHERES.

Every map is the same, every enemy is the same, every everything is the same. I am seriously upset that I got ripped off for $60 for this. The whole game feels like a demo for a much larger game that is floating around out there. But I guess the win, because they got my money. Between this and the truly disgustingly awful ""FarCry 2"" I think I am done with Ubisoft and won't be purchasing any more of their games.",negative

It's hard to believe how EA can purchase a thriving studio, and drive it into the ground title after title and not care...
It's a good thing it's easy to sell mindless, horrible great looking sports games to their tasteless herd of witless fans.

Classic EA formula in place here:

+ more graphics
+ more action
+ we need drm for our crappy game no one is going to want to play
+mass appeal since we are HUGE and have no concept of a fan base

- fun...no, let's focus on graphics instead of game play and plot
- strategy...you guys are also on the graphics team!
- ignore all existing fans
- C&C in title only

Why do modern devs believe that every single game has to have more action!?
Not everyone is looking for an action fix.  Do devs/designers not own TVs?  I can cut my TV on and get my fix 24/7.  How about quality game play, and a little thing called strategy...isn't that what built the genera?....

Enemies in this game are more difficult than they should be and mercilessly pummel you even on the easiest setting.

I will not allow EA to tell me how to use my LEAGALLY purchased game.

I can download a FREE copy and install it as many times as I want, but if I pay for it I am limited to 5 installs! I know EA only cares about the money, but this still baffels me.

931,"If you are a Christian or at least a person of faith, do not buy this product. For whatever reason, this series is promoting illuminati propaganda. The game developers are essentially attempting to indoctrinate young girls into the Illuminati mindset and culture. One of the characters refers to her royal (Illuminati) bloodline while pretending to believe in space aliens. Who knows what that background story was about. The Illuminati generally believe they descended from the heavens...so is she endorsing the ET phenomeon, but not the quirky Sonny Joon variety?

You get to search the Illuminati's handbag by clicking on an all-seeing eye and learn about the rituals and characters surrounding Illuminati beliefs.

Add to that this series fixation on satanic rituals, secret societies, Illuminati bloodlines, etc. and you have a problem. SPOILER: The Illuminati character turns out to be one of the good guys.

Message to the Illuminati: No one is impressed with you and your alleged blood lines, ie, awarding each other the most prominent positions in society through birth right and cronyism in order to amass the world's wealth and power under your own control and forcing taxpayers to subsidize your lifestyles, greed, ritualistic sacrifices,and degenerate lifestyles. You are parasites and unremarkable parasites at that. You are also an abomination to God. There is nothing impressive about any one of you. You have made a mess of the world. We owe the global wars for your quest for domination of the world's energy markets and the financial collapse to your greed.

It's sad that Nancy Drew brand has become another vehicle for the Illuminati to push its propaganda on the impressionable youth.

  The gameplay isn't that great, also.  The N64 version is much better, because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic, and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.
  I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics.  Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: ""Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A."" Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.
  I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didn't have much money at the time, so they decided to make a mediocre game.  This was bad.  Believe me.
  If you want a game with good gameplay, excellent graphics, wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it, get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.

The game only features geometrical shapes and solid colors for graphics. Seriously, it really does look like if you tried to make a 3D world out of construction paper. The controls are waaaaaay off as in if you start running, it's near impossible to turn/stop/maneuver your character and jumping on enemies consists of landing *directly* under your shadow or you will get hit and die. Gliding is a smaller jump that makes you ""float"" a little.... it's completely USELESS unless you need to use it on those floor-fan-enemies to float up.

950,"This is by far the worst game I have ever played. I read all the reviews first, but being the Romero fan that I am, I bought it anyway. Boy, was that a mistake! I loved the movie ""Land of the Dead"", and was willing to accept the limitations of a movie tie-in game. But that's one of three main problems with this game. It hardly ties in to the movie at all.

The only resemblance to the movie is an appearance by a Dennis Hopper lookalike, toward the end. You are supposedly cleaning out Fiddler's Green. Could have fooled me! It looks nothing like the movie. Your hero bears no relation to the movie at all. He's a John Wayne-looking redneck farmer. Probably not your first choice for an Avatar, but you take what you get, right?

Imagine about a dozen of the most generic shooter levels you can think of. Then, scramble them up in random order, toss them together with a flimsy story, and go. The results? Awful! That's the second horrible thing about this game - the level design. To say ""generic"" is an insult to respectable generic cereal everywhere (which I love to eat). You have your hospital, sewer, street, etc. And don't even get me started about the random stacks of hay bales conveniently forming a maze(?). Repetitive, to say the least.

But by far the worst thing about the game is the glitchy controls and programming. It takes 4 hits (sometimes 6 or 8) to kill a zombie. Their heads may blow up at random, but that seems to have nothing to do with where you shoot. They are repetitive, and annoying.

The worst is how the enemies spawn. You ALWAYS know when an enemy is near, because the moment they spawn, the screen jerks for a moment. There can be nothing onscreen, but the screen jerks, and that tells you a monster is coming. Pathetic.

The only things the game got right was the limited ammo, forcing you to conserve. You HAVE to learn melee attacks in order to survive. This was the only satisfying thing, hitting a zombie in the head with a golf club or pipe.

I also liked one moment when you have to snipe to help a buddy. But between the boring, monotonous levels, those kind of moments are few and far between.

The game is dark and bleak. Which is fine for a horror game. Only this one also adds in ugly level design and glitches, for a truly joyless gaming experience. Other people say this game is fun. I disagree. It is wretched.

I spent a lot of money on it, so I stuck with it. And when I wanted to quit, I decided to finish anyway. But I sold it immediately afterward, and I'm the kind of guy who NEVER sells games. To say there is no replay value is an understatement.

I never tried the multiplayer. I don't think I would want to spring this game on my worst enemy.

Don't be taken in by the good reviewers here. They are still in denial, trying to rationalize the money they wasted on this game. They're not yet ready to face the truth, which is a painful experience, I know.

Plus, the fact that this game keeps getting more and more expensive may make you think it is a collector's item. Don't believe it!!! Learn from my experience, fellow Zombie lover! Just because it's got Romero's name on the front does not warrant your purchase, trust me!

So if you like to spend lots of money and you like horror games, MINUS the fun, then by all means, buy this! Otherwise, I would highly recommend purchasing ""The Thing"". It is a horror survival movie tie-in game that they actually got RIGHT for a change.

951,"This game was amazing with the storytelling, voice acting, graphics, and overall gaming, but the company that offers this quality ruined the experience. RUINED it!

When logging in, I found out that my account was locked by Battlenet. This had never happened to me before for any online game. I usually suspected that people who get their accounts locked share their logins with friends, or use some 3rd party cheating system, but now it happened to me. I contacted customer support and they said I needed to download an Authenticator. It's a mobile app that gives a security code every 30 seconds then resets. I was thinking...okay, I have to keep my ipod charged every time I want to play Daiblo3 now. That is a setback. Years from now...I have to keep my ipod charged to play it. I was to enter this code into the game EVERY time I log in, in order to keep playing the game I bought. Through no fault of my own, my product was now more difficult to use from when I bought it on release day for $60!

Several months go by, I try logging in to play the game I purchased, but my authenticator doesn't sync with the Battlenet log in. The account locks. I can't log in. And now there's a new roadblock, in order to speak with customer support, I have to scan my driver's license and send it over the internet to Battlenet. Would you ever scan your driver's license and send it to a company you don't know for a game? I sent a message describing my issue without my scanned ID, and it was responded with a decline to help. Scanning my ID and sending it over the internet is not an option. With identity theft, that is a borderline Nigerian-scam. This has been the worst online service I have ever experienced. I have been with Blizzard since the mid-90s when I purchased Diablo 1 and then Diablo 2, and the first few World of Warcraft online games.

So I have a choice, to continue to use the product I bought, I have to send my photo identification over the internet to whoever is on the other end, or completely give up my purchase. Because of these roadblocks, I will pass on ANYTHING with Blizzard on it, because it isn't worth the headache or the sensation of getting ripped off.

953,"This game is TERRIBLE!!! Do not buy it!
Since this review has earned me a LOT of flak, I figured I'd update it and give the rabid fan's that have been bombing me a little more information as to why I gave this atrocious game a 1 star review;

I was very excited about this game, excited to a point where I was rabidly following any update I could find. Like an addict, I had to get my fix. So to say that this game was unfulfilling is a polite understatement. This is a game that was so vastly disappointing to me that it's taken awhile to calm down enough to write about it.

Let's talk about the good things, because it will be brief. Aliens Colonial Marines started off on a good note. Sure, the graphics were disappointing after such a long development cycle, but it's forgivable, at first, because your just so bloody EXCITED to start playing. Again at first, it's good. It's atmospheric, it uses the sounds and lighting in great ways. You feel tense, and it's perfect. It's the kind of Aliens game that you've been waiting for.

Sadly, for single player, that's about where the good things end. Multi-player provides a decent experience, even if the weapons are terrible and the game types are dated. Imagine the multi-player as Left 4 Dead, where all the Zombies have been removed and you're just playing against special infected. It's fun, and it provides its thrills, but eventually you do start to feel drained by it.

As is typical for the more recent additions to the Aliens video games, this is simply another disappointment in a long string of disappointments. The game engine is weak, to a point where it's more common for the game to glitch out and break down than work properly. The weapons are terrible. Whats the point of being able to carry so many if they all suck?

At first the pulse rifle is pretty great, and in single player it is legitimately the go-to weapon. Things like the flame thrower, smart gun and turrets are a blast, but eventually, like everything else, they simply fall way short of the mark.

The AI is a disaster. The aliens in single player are so predictable that you can count on them to ALWAYS make a bee line for you unless your playing in co-op. Your `friendly' marine AI is so bad it almost seems like they take pleasure in watching you get mauled to death and they will literally watch an alien beat you to death without doing a single thing to save you.
Worse, you can actually shoot THROUGH your teammates as if they weren't there, and vice versa, the aliens can leap through the AI characters like they were phantoms. The hit boxes are a wreck, with the only consistent thing being that head shots don't count as head shots. Character animations are choppy, to be nice about it, and how they interact with the game world is so terrible that it's common for you to `trip' on a rough edge in a level and get insta gibbed by fall damage.

As for the story line, it's confusing to me that for the first 10 minutes, they get the recipe right only to have it just crash and burn. It's almost as if they intentionally worked only on the parts they would display for the previews, and just went `Meh, who cares.' I'll give you an example, and I'm sorry for the spoilers, but for the majority of the game, YOU DON'T EVEN FIGHT ALIENS.

For whatever asinine reason, most of this game is spent fighting the private militia of the Weyland-Yutani Corp. I guess having us play a game that's based on the premise of fighting Aliens was just too much for the good people at Gearbox/TimeGate Studios to handle. It's a move that had me shaking my head, because how did this make sense to anyone during development? `Lets make a game about fighting aliens, but you barely ever get to fight aliens.' Sure, sound plan, makes perfect sense.

Aliens Colonial Marines isn't just a disappointing game, because it's not simply bad, for a `game of passion,' that Gearbox was so utterly fanatic about, this is a travesty. It's a crappy game with the Aliens brand name slapped on top, a more blatant cash grab than I care to consider. This is nigh unforgivable. And to add insult to injury, insider leaks are pointing to the fact that Gearbox lied to us about how much control and work they actually put into the game. Important figureheads at Gearbox are on record saying that they were responsible for something like '80%' of the game, when in fact it turns out that they may have designed a level or two in Multi-player. Maybe. Turns out that TimeGate Studios has been in charge of this `hellish development cycle,' for years now, and they are responsible for making the majority of this game. Why lie about it? Well TimeGate has a rather dismal record when it comes to making games. You might remember them for, well, nothing really. They've never been able to produce a quality game, although to be honest, they have a really clever PR department.

At the end of the day, all my ranting boils down to two points; This game is awful, and the only redeeming factor about it is Multi-player, but even that is a tedious, glitchy and rage inducing affair. Do yourself a favor and rent this one if your really curious, I know from checking earlier today that Redbox is already carrying this. Regardless of whatever nostalgic feelings you might have towards this brand, this game utilizes the Aliens name as little more than a hollow gimmick to reel you in and steal your money. Honestly, this game is so bad it's not even worth the bandwidth required to pirate it.

For the folks giving me flak about the original review; Go look it up on Youtube you poor saps.
It is possible to beat this game in 3 hours, at max difficulty settings, if you don't play like a drunken chimpanzee.
If your competent enough to figure out where the dev's might have dropped a spawn point or a trigger, you can literally run through most of this game without having to fire a shot.[...]or youtube 'Aliens Colonial Marines Pacifist Mode' for a really great example of how easy it is.)

Rent this if you can. If you already bought it, my condolences.",neutral
954,"It's hard to start talking about Diablo 3 because, as I see it - and I've seen my opinion reflected on many other reviews - it has so many wrong things going on for it that it's kind of bewildering. I will try to express my disappointment and concern because I believe this game is a clear beacon as to to where video game developers are heading as of late, and a blatant case of how a company becomes so arrogant that it manages to neglect all inputs and feedback from its loyal fan base.

So let's start with one of the biggest gripes people have had: the launch day fiasco. If it were any other developer in the world (except maybe EA); if they hadn't BETA-tested the game for many months and hadn't performed a public stress test two weeks prior to launch; if they didn't have the experience with WoW and SC2, it would be almost forgivable. But no, the had all the data, all the experience and all the means of supporting the launch for the game, and they miserably failed at it. And why wouldn't they fail at it? In today's business of pre-orders we finance video game development and receive nothing back, and we don't even demand anything back from them. Blizzard had the obligation of giving a working piece of software for all of us that payed the price for it in advance, and they get away with a lame excuse in their website? This is just so wrong, in so many levels.

The gameplay was really dumbed-down and everyone is talking about it. The graphics, for me, aren't an issue, but the animations are ludicrously bad. Try watching the Demon Hunter fire two crossbows at once and you'll see what I mean bay BAD ANIMATION.

Other aspects of the game that really stand out like a sore thumb: the quest screen is useless. Whereas in Diablo 2 you had a screen showing which quests you had completed, which was active and details on it, now you have a very vague description of your current task. If you want to see any piece of lore or any detail on your past exploits, you need to painfully navigate lots of sub menus. This has written ""rushed"" all over it. The very streamlined stats screen is also a joke, and if compared to the one from Diablo 2 it could easily be mistaken by a Diablo Lite version.

And now, for my biggest gripe with the game... The story line, the characters and the whole universe of Diablo 3. ***Spoiler alert, don't continue reading if you haven't finished at least act 1***

In Diablo 2 we're greeted by this epic intro scene where we'd be introduced to the Wanderer in this very creepy mausoleum. We'd also witness what lied in his wake as an inn was engulfed in flames. And thus would begin our journey. Now we're introduced to Cain and his anime-inspired teen niece who had NEVER BEEN PRESENT IN THE OTHER GAMES. Now she magically appears and, as the intro goes on, we hear this annoying new narrator scream ""uncle"" just before the supposedly intimidating Diablo 3 logo is shown. It's such an anticlimax start.

The story is so bad, so stupid that they managed to have Deckard Cain survive a meteor crash and escape the Skeleton King only to be killed at the end of Act 1. The single most likable and recognized character in the series is thrown in the trash and replaced by this very annoying niece. Also, if the niece wasn't a dumb choice to begin with, she is given some sort of ""secret powers"" that conveniently manifest at key times in the narrative, showing not only a lack of creativity but a total deus ex machina gimmick.

Diablo 3 deserves to be panned as it's been. It is the pinnacle of everything that is wrong with the video game development now a days: games being released with bugs, companies not measuring up to the ludicrous hype THEY create, not having to answer for the fact the game, which was already bought months earlier, does not run, simplified and dumbed-down gameplay, etc etc.

960,"Yes, it's beautiful. Unfortunately, the beauty is a facade, the voice acting is mediocre, and the gameplay stinks.

Let's cover some of the basics:

- Huge world, no rapid travel. No teleports, vehicles, even transit animals. You have to walk everywhere, and it takes forever.

- Enjoy running around in the dark. A lot. Because everything is more fun when you can't see the traps and the enemies, to say nothing of where you're going! ... Or just turn up the gamma on your television and get on with the game.

- As other commenters have mentioned, the difference between one combo skill and another is holding versus pressing a button down. The game frequently misinterprets your actions.

- Someone apparently thought that allowing your crafting abilities to fail, destroying the items  la FFXI, was wonderful and kept things interesting. Except that, here, there's not even the flimsy justification of ""keeping the server economy stable"" behind this incredibly stupid idea.

- The boss battles have strange objectives that are often unclear, and when there hasn't been a save point in a long time, the frequent deaths on these become especially punishing.

- Having to herd cats -- excuse me, party members -- in towns is a strange abstraction that only serves to make crafting, equipping items, and other mundane tasks annoying and excruciating.

- Your party members love to ignore you when you die, leading to game over more often than not. Nevermind that they have plenty of opportunity and resources to resurrect you: conservation is the game here, and you're obviously expendable. The fact that you get to watch them ignore you, before you truly have to restart from your last save two hours ago, makes this all the more frustrating.

- I suppose one of the conditions from Square as a publisher was that they needed a pretty (and oblivious) male main character, and several bouncy women with extraordinarily high-pitched voices. If that's what you look for in your JRPGs, look no further.",negative

968,"This installment of Final Fantasy is definitely story driven. Sadly, however, the story is weak. Six months after playing the game, I can't even remember what those triangular spirits were about. Thank goodness for the nice dialogue. Without it the game would be untolerable. Character interaction is minimal, and there is no real team spirit.
The main character Vaan and his friend Penelo seem to be nothing more than luggage. There's no point in them being in the game. I can't say that's a good thing.
The evil guys and side characters are lame and their doings seem pointless. As with the main characters, none are truly explored.
Talking with the townspeople is utterly pointless.

The graphics are nice, though nothing mind-blowing. I didn't want to stop to view the scenery at any point. I have to applaud them for making the cities even a bit lively looking, by adding a lot of silent characters. One point of complaint is the very lame spell effects.
The CGI scenes are nothing spectacular, definitely a step back from FFX. This was the first installment in the series where I wasn't looking forward to seeing the CGI scenes.

The voice-acting is good, all the main characters give solid performances. *But* the Marquis and Al-Cid almost succeed in spoiling my respect towards the other performances. Thank goodness they have so few lines. All in all the voice acting is one of the best aspects of the game.

The real-time battle system is a radical change from past games. It's nice but doesn't make the battles less tedious or repetitive in the long run. The enemies are also mostly boring.
The party AI doesn't really shine, but thank goodness you can limit its stupidity with the Gambit System. Too bad that lots of the useful gambits appear only at the later stages of the game.

The license board works for someone who likes perfect customization, but unfortunately I don't. I want characters who truly differ in their abilities. And talking about abilities, I found all the skills and most of the power ups really lame and useless.
The summons, called Espers, are stupid-looking and useless in combat.

The maps are at times annoyingly large. The fact that there are no secrets or secret places, and the randomized treasure, add to the insult. Many times the game devolved into a multiple hour running through empty fields, between short cutscenes.

The music is bad. Nobue Uematsu left them and they replaced him with some clueless punk. There is zero memorability and some themes are just annoying. It's the worst I've heard in any RPG I've played.

CLOSING COMMENTS:
When I started playing, I was positively surprised by the good voice-acting, the nice - and at times witty - dialogue and olden style of speaking used by some characters.
However it didn't take long to become annoyed by the pointless main character Vaan, the trite and stupid plot, lack of character interaction, huge and empty fields/dungeons with random and often useless treasure.
All in all this game is about running hours and hours through fields, fighting repetitive enemies, so you could see a 5 minute stupid cut scene that advances the inane plot.",positive
969,it is a useless as a ps2 game .,negative
970,"EDIT: This preface is added in after I had written everything following this paragraph. I have reduced my score and impression of the game to 1 star from 2 because of something I recently discovered about the game in a interview with Motomu Toriyama the games director. I found out when reading this that square/enix had decided to leave the game as a cliffhanger and extend the ending through DLC. Yes thats right, if you want to see the games ending youll have to buy DLC. Aside from that evidently character stories like for Lighting and some other characters. So basically if you buy this game and you want some of the characters stories and the ENDING TO THE GAME you will have to pay extra money. Ive always strongly opposed DLC because while in essence its a neat idea but in reality it will eventually become a something to exploit more money from customers, a way to make their 60 dollar game turn into a 90 dollar game to get the whole experince you should have gotten in the first place. When you buy a game for 60 dollars and then buy DLC for it for 10 or 20 dollars you are telling developers ""Yes I am willing to spend 70 or 80 dollars on one game"" and eventually they will start charging that. But thats a story for another day. In the end if you want to beat this game and see the end be prepared to pay even more, you can find the stories easily on google by just looking for ""final fantasy xiii-2 dlc ending"".

I'm bored with this game. I last about 25 hours into it and its just a generic, clich and mediocre rpg like square has been making for over a decade now. Sadly the reason I don't care for square games is they care more about graphics and cutscenes than they do crafting a interesting story, well designed characters and a well written and overall fun game. This is no exception to the rule because it's obvious the graphics are what they cared about first and foremost in this.

A big problem with this game is that it seems like a really great game and that its very well done, but that's because you're comparing it to the first one that was panned more or less universally. See the first one was such a big deal to everyone being a major final fantasy title on current systems on 360 and ps3 that everyone got so hyped up and when they found current gen tech still doesn't make square games any better they were severely bummed out. So by the time this one comes around its still not a very good game but it is at least what the first one should have been. So then they play this and expectations are so low that even though the game stinks its better than most think it is. Kind of spending 20 years of your only eating stale rice cakes for all your meals and then one day someone gives you a ritz cracker. Sure the ritz cracker is just a plain old boring cracker but in comparison to 20 years of rice cakes you would swear that ritz is a new york strip steak and the best tasting cracker ever created.

I just very much get the sense of ""I have been here before......A LOT of times before and I seem to recall this being more fun"". I just found myself going through the usual paces, not really paying attention to what passes for a story because its either so uninteresting I can't be bothered to pay attention or its things Ive seen before in a hundred other games or its simply so poorly thought out that it doesn't make much sense. All the characters are just generic and sterile cookie cutter Japanese style characters. The battles are easy and not much fun, the fighting becomes very grindish feeling pretty quick. Even the most action packed cut scenes still can't raise an eyebrow or heart rate because they stink of the same style and flair square has been using for a long time now.

Was also quite disappointed at the fact I hadn't even gotten my copy in the mail and I reading news of the DLC they are going to release. It makes me even less interested when a dev starts pimping dlc before the game is even cold on the shelf.

Bottom line is I should have waited till this was 20 bucks. Its generic, sterile, bland, boring, uninspired, just like a dozen other games square has done and feels more like square pulling the lever on the register than actually trying to make a game.

Essentially I equate square games and this game in particular to a big budget blockbuster hollywood movie that's directed by Michael bay. Yes it has a big name behind it, yes it had millions of dollars spent on making it, yes its special effects are impressive, yes it's been hyped up a lot, yes a lot of people are talking about it, yes its another one in a long line of sequels to a franchise. But its also really boring because its designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's made to be like a shotgun blast trying to hit as many paying customers as quickly as possible. So essentially it has dumbed itself down in order to try and be as generic as possible so the largest amount of gamers will buy it. It has no personality, no unique feeling, no heart, no soul and it's no fun because it's purely a product created with the one and only sole intention of selling as many possible copies as it can. It wasn't created by talented people, it wasn't created with any love, it wasn't created by inspiration, no care went into it, it just simply a game created to make sales based off the fact it has the final fantasy brand name in its title and that is all. This game is to gaming what essentially michael bays transformers movies (especially the 3rd one) to film making.

With so many other really great quality games out there from talented developers I can't even begin to suggest anyone play this or purchase it. Between little downloadable games to other full price retail titles there is no real reason to spend 60 bucks or even 25 on this game. Want a newer Japanese rpg? Then go and buy atelier totori the adventurer of arland, disgaea 4, or runes factory tides of destiny instead and have a much more unique experience playing a rpg that's actually fun and tries to do its own thing.

If this game did not have the words ""final fantasy"" in it then I guarantee you the reviews would be a lower across the board. That's the problem with final fantasy is it's like rodney dangerfield in his old age; yeah he is faded, does a lot of dumb stuff and no one really likes him anymore but people will despite all of it still give him way too much room and credit because of his name. And that's what final fantasy is, its just a name that makes fanboys squee with glee and something gamers will buy even if they don't care for it just so they can be part of the crowd that plays ever FF game because it's a knee jerk reaction.

Trust me, save your money because you can buy multiple other games with what this costs and have a much better time in the end. Wait 3 months and get it for 20 bucks off ebay. Final fantasy is the proverbial old dog that can't learn new tricks and no matter how many times it will fetch the ball at some point it stops being amusing to the person throwing it and they end up doing so just because that's what they have always done.",positive

989,"Kinect games are hit or miss, and although they're all generally getting better, they still don't offer a good experience in controller-less gaming.  Disneyland Adventures is a game that especially demonstrates this.

UNBOXING:

The game is a standard Xbox CD and  comes in a clamshell that only has two pamphlets.  Neither one tells you how to play.

GAMEPLAY:

The game is very detail oriented, and replicates a virtual Disneyland to a tee.  However, the controlling of the avatars is a PAIN IN THE @$$!  The game will often drop the player for no reason.  When coming back into the game, you need to wave frantically and it doesn't always (mostly never) pick you up again.  Then when you get back in the game, your avatar randomly changes: from boy to girl and vice versa, and from race to race.

There's a little ticket avatar that tells you the basics of movement: essentially hold your hand out to go directions forward, left and right.  Wave to interact with other avatars.  Hands in the air to take a picture.  But that's it.  As far as how to play any of the games, there are no instructions.

PROS:

- It's Disneyland!
- Voice overs sound like Disney Character cartoons

CONS:

- Controlability (BIG CON)
- No instructions

OVERALL:

This game IS NOT for anyone under the age of 10.  All of my kids cannot play this game because of the glitches in the contolling avatars.  They all gave up within 5-10 minutes of playing.

997,"Fans of the survival horror gaming genre were no doubt excited by unraveling the mystery of Sirens errie Japanese town with the terrifying past. Sadly, the premise is about as exciting as the game gets.

The Pros

This game is a really gorgeous visual treat. The chracters are rendered with a new technolgy that actually wraps realistic images onto 3d computerized planes.

The setting has been developed well. The village of Hanuda is a scary place cast in eternal darkness surrounded by a sea of blood and of course the Siren going off in the background.

The Cons (and there are many)

The game developers dubbed the game with a British voice over crew which in the beginning is comical but after awhile just feels ridiculous. For some people this may not be an issue at all but for me it just seemed distracting playing a Japanese guy and to hear him shout ""Oi Mate! wait up!""

Secondly, the gameplay is terribly limited and re-do's abound. More skilled gamers may not have to replay missions as much but I found it hard not to be killed as 80% of the time your only defense is to run and hide. The game employs a drop down menu to issue command to your character. The menu is easy to use but truly annoying. A good example occurs on the first mission. Your goal is to escape a bad guy via car. The drop down menu asks you 1) Would you like to pick up the car key? 2) Would you like get in the car? 3) Put key in ignition? 4) Turn key to start car?- truly gets to be cumbersome to game play.

Lastly, the game uses a event system/ time table for you to keep track of events as they happen to all 10 playable chracters. While that sounds convoluted in itself it only gets worse that you have to play all ten characters and not one at a time. The game is broken up into missions. For example,one mission may involve a journalist and reveal certian parts of the mystery and these events are recorded on the time table. The next mission you are introduced to a new character and complete the next mission and learn more. You must refer back to the time table to try and piece it all together.

Siren was a truly exciting idea thta really failed to deliver. I don't feel many people actually completed as I myself grew bored and gave up halfway through. If you truly want to be scared and enetertained I recommend Fatal Frame 1 or 2 as both are in my opinion the best (and scariest) the genre has to offer.",positive
998,"Quite what anyone was thinking when this was greenlighted is beyond me, as what resulted was a game which no Metroid fan could fail to hate, and which from a more objective view has little to nothing to offer which another game hasn't done better.

From a Metroid perspective, the game is a brutal slap in the face. In the game in which the decision was made to expand on Samus' backstory, little consistency in story or characters is to be had throughout, and players of any other Metroid titles will be quick to note the numerous flagrant inconsistencies with previous games. Moreover, story is often used as an element to limit exploration and player action rather than expanding it over the game; this includes arbitrarily locking doors that limit where the player can go with no real explanation, unlocking upgrades because an unlikeable character gives Samus permission to do so (when she already had it), and even worse. It's hard not to hate every character's guts and the story a short while into the game.

Gameplay wise the adventure becomes quite linear, losing replay value, killing the exploration that made previous games successful. Even non-Metroid fans will soon become bored with being spoon-fed every acquirable item. The upgrades themselves add little to the overall gameplay, and are altogether too incremental to maintain novelty. Though environments are decently rendered and composed, lack of camera angle control prevents detracts from this, and the simple fact is that the Prime games clearly look more fleshed out in most regards.

Combat could have been compelling, and brought new fast-paced action to the series. Unfortunately, combat ultimately boils down to repeatedly mashing the directional pad to automatically dodge attacks and unleash a counter, and the choice to eschew both a lock-on system and a useful manual aiming during normal run and gun mode means even more control is taken away from the player as the game takes over aiming in large part. An awkward first person mode for missile aiming and scanning forces the player to stand still and inevitably take hits, though at least the transition is relatively seamless. The end result is a repetitive combat experience which quickly becomes tedious, and is altogether too easy to finish.

Overall, what we are left with it a game which can barely stand on its own and account of terrible story and surprisingly boring gameplay, and which fails to carry forward any of the good aspects of the series it purports to be a part of.",negative

I have a brand new AMD 64 processor and a Radeon 9600 256 mb video card.  (Note to the previous reviewer who actually got the game to work with older ATI drivers; that sure didn't work for me.)  After spending about 10 hours over two evenings installing, uninstalling, reinstalling drivers, patches, DirectX 9.0c about ten times, loading every update available for XP, and the game itself, and following every instruction from 2K to the letter, I've given up.

This game simply does not work.

I'm pretty much at the point that I don't care if Fraxis comes out with a patch to fix the problems or not.  It's clear to me someone got greedy and rushed this product out about four months too early to take advantage of Christmas shoppers.  My advise would be to wait awhile before you buy this title to see if the bugs get fixed or not.

Civ IV is on my list all right; my RETURN list.",positive
1003,"So I'm about 12 hours in but I'm pretty sure I'm done. Not that the campaign is over (most reviews are saying that it's like 20-30 hours) but there are just too many problems I have with the game.

1- The BUGS and no, I'm not talking about the accidentally released ""preview build"" that excited fans purchased on steam at midnight(My friend was unlucky enough to get that crap) I'm talking about the horrible hit boxes for the zombies. It's completely random whether or not you have enough reach (or too much, sometimes the zombies will be too close for it to register). I was playing coop with a friend and for some reason, people kept addressing me as ""him"" even if I played a chick. What's the kicker however, is that there isn't even a day one patch to fix (allegedly) 37 major bugs, many of them game ending glitches.

2- The STORY we all remember the stunning first trailer (that put it on the map) of the father trying to save his dying daughter to the sound of a lone violin. Well, this game has none of that. Instead, what we get is 4 playable characters who, although they have a paragraph of info at the start, don't do anything for the plot. Where is the emotional drama you might ask? All the characters do is regurgitate the same one liners like ""Take that, bitch!"" to stupid zingers.

3- The ENVIRONMENT- We were told that this would be open world, and it certainly is. How much of it is interactive? Very little. Outside of the weapons and health items, pretty much the only things that even move are the slow moving beach balls and chairs. Zombies are also not randomly spawned like left for dead, all you need to do is pay attention to exactly where the ""bosses"" come from and then avoid those places since they mostly offer little worthwhile rewards addressed in my next point

4- The WEAPONS- I'm not saying there isn't imagination in the weapon designs, they're quite creative. Unfortunately, most become useless to your almighty foot. Kicking takes no stamina, the knock back of enemies brings them to the floor, and you can upgrade your ""foot"" ability to the point where if you are ever surrounded, all you need to do is put your back to a wall and start kicking. It's quite comical.

This list keeps going, but this is already becoming quite a long review, so I'll just leave it at that I'm sure people will find more BS that pops up in this game, so just take this as a cautionary tale.....",negative

1010,"There are good points to this product. When I first got it, I loved it. The Kailh switches felt fine. Just as good as Cherry. I did sour on their feel after a while for typing, but that's personal taste.

It seems like a quality product, with a nice braided cord and sturdy, heavy plastic. It's pretty in my opinion, though I disliked the font.

I also loathed the software, Razer Synapse, from the beginning. It's strangely unresponsive, too small, and making and editing long macros (I use them to make pre-typed messages for work) is very frustrating and inconvenient.

All these are trifles compared to the problems that developed a few months in. The e key began pressing twice half the time. Then the right shift key stopped working reliably, then entirely.

Their customer support aided me fine with a problem I had with my DeathAdder mouse previously, but on this issue they ignored all my questions and offered to send me a new one when I shipped this one back, despite my explanation I needed even an infuriatingly defective keyboard to work.

So this isn't a very broad sample size, but I've purchased two Razer products, and they're both faulty. My conclusion: never buy Razer again. Their QA is obviously garbage. Also watch the Ultra Street Fighter 4 grand finals at this year's Evo for a very important and costly example of their shoddy QA when Momochi's Razer fight stick stopped working.

This also, to me, settles the debate about whether Kailh switches are inferior to Cherry MX switches. They feel fine, but their QA seems to be lacking. Cherry's, on the other hand, is renowned.

So with the poor customer service and plain poor quality product, my recommendation to everyone reading this is do not buy this. If you don't know anything about mechanical keyboards and just thought, ""Oh, Razer. I know them."" then think again. Do some research. There are many good manufacturers out there. Pay slightly more for a product from Cherry, or Ducky, or even just Corsair, with Cherry switches, over these Kailh switches.

Because Razer is hesitant to make it too known, but these ""Razer"" switches are manufactured by Kailh. And it seems to show. If I hadn't deleted all the extra e's that popped up while writing this, it would show even more.",negative

The graphics are poor and lack any finesse, the controls for the ships are slow and useless, the colors are gaudy, and, combined with the lack of definition caused by the poor, smugdy graphics, really hurt your eyes.

GAME GEAR GAMES!!!! oh yeah and they are really aweful as well. so yeah the only thing that I think this game has going for it is its pretty box art. other than that...stay away please. if you wanna spend $40 on a sonic game, pick up the Mega Collection. those games a fun.",negative
1017,"If there is ever something funny to me, it is the fact that people are amazed by this quack who has no super powers. There is nothing impressive about this game or this ""hero"". They still use the same terrible voice actor Kevin Conroy, who was also in the abysmal Batman Animated Series. This game doesn't really look that different from the entries in the franchise, and it seems very recycled when it comes to gameplay. It's just terrible. The graphics, while they may impress you now and then, is all this game has to offer. Everything else sucks and the value is incredibly low. The A.I. bored me to tears, the villains as usual are not interesting, and Batman does not give you an imposing presence when you control him.

Sad, I go back with EA games to the Atari 800.  I notice the Cracked EXE

was released!  Almost anyone can get it.  But we don't. Why?

1. Programmers should be paid for their work
2. There are more honest people out there than pirates
3. Who knows what you are getting from someone that messed with the .exe.
I will buy my 3 copies thank you.

But not while they have this system in place that stops me from
using the product I paid for down the road...  You would think they would

This is also a very disturbing trend for a game - if you buy this one, you can expect to see more games use a similar scheme.

I tried it, put it away for several weeks, then returned, hoping that the patches would fix the problems.  Sadly, they did not help a single bit.  Turns out the Leap Motion was made with the cheapest possible cameras available.  I tried to get use to is over a few weeks, but it is a very poor sensor.  It can detect your hand, and if you move very slowly it looks like its going to work.  But as soon as you start using it you realize its a complete mess.  It can barely keep up with two fingers at a time, let alone 4 or 5.  You can set to swipe up two fingers to be anything you want, click, drag, open...etc.  But after you swipe up, then move your hand back down and it sees it as another command. Pretty much undoing what you had just done.  I tried swiping up then moving my hand out then back in, but that is cumbersome at best.

1025,"I am one of the fortunate ones who has an Xbox 360 that has worked beautifully from the day I got it.  However, with all of the other unlucky owners who have been having overheating problems with their systems, I felt compelled to protect my 360.  Sure, Microsoft extended the warranty to 3 years, but why be without my 360 for several weeks if it can be avoided?  For a long time I sat and wondered if buying an external cooler was necessary.  After playing through Saints Row and having the game freeze or stall on me several times, I was convinced I should.  So I bought myself this Nyko Intercooler thinking ""aside from spending 20 unnecessary bucks, what can it hurt?""

Apparently a lot.  Fortunately I realized this before it too late but this thing was doing more harm than good, and for others who have purchased this, it was too late, and it killed their 360.  Apparently drawing power from the 360 makes it even more prone to overheating.
Technically, it works.  It's easy to install, and the fans increase airflow.  But what difference does it make if the fans work if it overheats the 360 anyway?  Oh and if I'm not mistaken, Microsoft's warranty doesn't cover damage done by this product because it's an unlicensed product.  Super!

I should note that aside from the problems in Saints Row, which I've found are from flaws in the game's engine itself and not the actual hardware, I had never had problems with my 360.  But while the Intercooler was attached, I got the Red Ring of Death 3 times, which made my heart jump out of my chest but it was only momentary and started up fine on the next attempt each time.  After hearing some very unhealthy noises (this thing is LOUD and I was afraid my CD tray had been damaged or something - seriously, it rivals the noise from the nearby landing planes) I removed this piece of junk.  Now, I cannot confirm this is what caused my dreaded RROD but guess what?  Yup, no more errors!  Coincidence?  I think not.

Just do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing which appears to do the exact opposite of what it intends to do.  Either find a licensed product or trust that your 360 will stay in good health.  If it doesn't, the warranty covers you.",negative

EA and Origin have ruined what could have been a good game.  I'm to the point where I really don't care if they ban me - that right there should tell you something!  If you have any desire to purchase this game - DON'T!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!

The company doesn't have the first clue what their LOYAL CUSTOMERS want.  This iteration of SimCity is a big screwfest to all their fans.  Save your money and purchase something else.

The DRM and small city size make this game just awful.  You can't hardly play it.  I know they'll have a patch out soon to address more issues but the issue is that you can't play this game offline!

I repeatedly mis-clicked the right button because the raised lip yielded too easily as I moved the mouse at times partly pushed by my middle finger. The side buttons were too easily pressed as well.

1033,"In the wake of the revolutionary Grand Theft Auto 3, there were a horde of pretender games released that couldn't come close to GTA's audacity and style.  True Crime: Streets of LA was actually one game that came close in this sense, which is why this sequel, True Crime: New York City, was so looked forward to.  However, not only is this game supremely disappointing, it's almost unplayable.  At first glance the game looks slick enough, but once you engage in the game's storyline and horrible dialogue along with the unbelievably choppy frame rate, you'll wonder how this ever got released.  The story of the game is you play as Marcus; an undercover cop looking to clean up the streets, one way or another.  No matter which route you take: good cop or bad cop, it's going to be hard to get past the fuzzy graphics, the clunky controls, the derivative gameplay, the inane collision detection, and bugs that plague True Crime: New York City throughout the game.  There's hardly anything good worth noting about True Crime, other than a somewhat decent soundtrack (featuring punk favorites the Misfits as well as the godfather of ghoul rock Danzig, and naturally plenty of hip-hop, ugh...) and a surprisingly solid cast of actors supplying their voices (including Christopher Walken, Laurence Fishburne, Mickey Rourke, and Mariska Hargitay among others) who are sadly wasted with the cliche dialogue.  Also, it should be noted that the game will crash randomly, a lot.  It's a wonder how this game ever got past quality control, but then again, I guess everyone's got to make a quick buck these days.  Do yourself a favor; stick with GTA, any GTA for that matter, even the original one for the PS1.  Just whatever you do, leave this game on the shelf.",negative

1039,"MOHAA is a game that is ideally suited for the person who gives no regard for even the slightest bit of realism and decent storyline. Essentially, this game is a slowed down Quake with Germans and Allies instead of Marines and monsters.... I knew this was not going to be a Ghost Recon, Operation: Flashpoint, or World War II Online, but its pathetic, and made me remember why I gave up console games so long ago. Not even a hint of realism here.
MOHAA makes me think of the movie Kellys Heroes where the Americans march right through German lines and single handedly kill hundreds of soldiers, only this isn't even comparable to the movie because its so bad!
OK, the game's graphics are really nice. Not on the scale of Ghost Recon, but still nice. Maybe if the soldiers weren't so dumb and you at least had a little control over them it would be slightly better, but you don't.
I really cannot recommend this game to anyone except hard-core teenage Quake players. I bet it will sell a ton, because the gaming community has very low standards for success at the moment.

1054,"I really enjoyed D1 and D2, as most people did to make them the landmark games they were. D3 is certainly inspired by these two games, but aside from similar proper noun names, and the general gameplay there is no relation. D3 has gone in a different direction art-wise, and though I preferred the more ""realistic"" look of the first two, I can say that there are truly some amazing views, and you have to respect the creativity and dedication that went into making this game's graphics. -Mostly a personal opinion, though given my initial hesitance, I would say most people could enjoy it moderately.

Music and sound effects are great, it adds a lot to the experience.

Monsters are misplaced transfers from the first two - mostly the same creatures, moved into different environments. There are some new surprises and the skills and abilities that they have are fairly interesting. The only challenge comes from monsters being totally over powered - there's no tactics. While the isometric view is at times pretty and in the vein of Diablo series, it's not particularly easy to work with World of Warcraft raid mechanics.

If you've raided in world of warcraft, you've beat the bosses in Diablo 3. They're good fights, but I played WoW long enough to tell you where each of the boss abilities comes from - nothing new here.

Character abilities first seem totally uncustomizeable. At about nightmare difficulty, lvl 30-40 you start to think that there's actually a lot of customization that you're going to get. The skill and rune combinations are massive. Unfortunately, most of them are prohibitive to play, it takes forever to change them and the UI - responded to ad nausea during the beta, is made for a young child. Not the adult, mature rated game with lots of gore and a little nudity.

Overall, you'll probably enjoy it for the first play through if you liked the other Diablo games. If you just appreciate it as an ""inspired by"" as opposed to a sequel. But it get's old fast, even if you start playing after Activision Blizzard manages to get their login and game play servers working. Until then, expect to lag out of a ""single player"" game. Expect to lose achievements and character records, and expect to die a lot from lag. They'll either fix it (I hope and imagine) or after people have beat the game, and no longer want to sell items for a million gold two days after release (the economy is going down fast in this game... way too many resources, no gold sinks, use and sell rares, recover every gem you've ever made...)

If you have the money to spare, and want to support a once brilliant company that has been bought out and is all about the money now, go ahead. You'll probably have a decent time. But there are way better games, with much more to offer, for less than this that you should really turn your attention to.

-Update-
Just wanted to add, that with the first hot fix, Blizzard is changing character skills and abilities, but not the in-game tooltips. There are no fixes for server lag, disconnects, and deaths due to lagging out.
They are causing anyone who was used to playing a class, alone or with other people in strictly co-op (no PvP yet!!) to have to adjust to modified skills and abilities. The tinkering of an always on, always patched game become apparent.
If you didn't dislike a lot about this game already, the unavoidable re-balancing, modifications of characters, and the lack of any sort of in-game update to ability descriptions should definitely put you off.

Of the two dragons (Spyro and Cynder), both are supposed to be able to go up in level, but the control needed to bring up Cynder (L2) does not work. Tried every possible button in case manual was wrong, to no avail. The control to switch between Cynder and Spyro in single-person mode stops working after the opening scene. In two-person mode, Cynder's magical attacks stop working after you lower the horn to the floor. Because of these broken controls, we became permanently stuck at ""blow horn to open door"" about 45 minutes into the game. Played through several different ways, and nothing helped -- not even the Cheats listed on internet sites.

We have a new PS2 station, and we bought a new copy of this game. This isn't like a PC game where there is some hope of a driver update to fix the problem, either.

What a disappointment.  This game was looking to be one of the nicest in the series yet.  But it turned out to be one of the buggiest-glitchiest-noplayableest games ever made.  Where to start.  Well, I guess at the beginning.  I got the game as a free download.

A summary of problems.

1. first the discount code was not enterable
2. then it took six hours to download
3. after the six hours the program would not launch.  Turns out to have been corrupted download files.  UBISOFT verify and more downloading but this time was not too bad.
4. next game launches into a black screen.  The fix for me is to power off the monitor then power it back on (what?) then I can see the screen.  Exiting the game gives the same problem.  Game exists to black screen.  Must cycle the monitor off/on in order to see my windows desktop.
5. in game... what can I say.  could have been beautiful except for the frame rate hangs every three seconds that make the game totally unplayable.  It is unplayable.

For those that remember the original release of Fallout 3... this is way worse.

What does UBISOFT have to say.  What can they say.  Sorry sorry sorry; we are patching it.  Yeah, they will be patching it for a while.  I will have to think twice before I let a ""free game"" sway me in one direction or another when making my purchases in the future.

1076,"I know my video game blogs are the least read, but I actually do have people asking me to review them from time to time. I just think its good to talk about a variety of topics so that people know I can have a life beyond politics.
 I have a long history with Mega Man, it was one of my favorite game series as a child. Mega Man, alongside Zelda, Final Fantasy and Castlevania ate up much of my spare time in my youth, but Mega Man 8 ruined the franchise. In addition to the terrible voice overs the levels were often nightmarishly hard and what was worse they strayed away from the series usual on foot exploration with near impossible rocket sledding which required you to jump and slide at ridiculous speeds while fighting enemies at the same time without super tight controls rendering your button inputs unresponsive. Then Mega Man and Bass came out. I only beat one of the bosses before giving up.
 Mega Man 9 was supposed to fix all this by going back to a Mega Man 2 style. Well, mega Man went back to the Mega Man 2 style, however the bad guys didn't get the memo. Mega Man has been stripped of his sliding ability and the super awesome mega buster both of which are necessary to compete in this game fairly.
 You see enemies attack as aggressively as they do in the most recent sequels, but now you have only the walk jump and shoot (slowly) to deal with this. As recently as Mega Man 8 (which sucked for different reasons) you had the ability to slide under attacks, charge up and release a power shot, you could even upgrade your normal weapon to fire faster, and even got a shot gun like spread to fire as many as 5 pellets at once. Fighting baddies was not the primary problem Mega Man 8 faced, but rather its absurd rocket board levels and poor designs behind the ""robot masters"" you fight. (Come on, clown man? Seriously?) Everything about Mega Man 9 sucks.
 The level design is uninspired and literally oversaturated with spikes. It's as if they got a 14 year old as their chief designer whose core design philosophy was, ""and then, for the next big surprise, we'll put spikes on the wall!"" Dodging is next to impossible with mega man walking, not running, and now unable to slide beneath attacking enemies. You feel especially crippled when attacked by a mutant rock in Jewel man's stage. The enemies are harder to fell without being able to deliver a power shot and the worst part is that there seems to be a halfway decent story for the first time in the series... that is if progress in the game were possible at all. As a game series goes on players should feel gradually more empowered, gaining new skills and building upon the enhancements of the last game, or at least giving you new abilities all together to meet the new challenges. Instead Mega Man 9 takes away your gains and makes you start with only the same abilities Mega Man had in Mega Man 1.
  To make it all worse they couldn't have even been bothered to at least make this game look as good as Mega Man 8 (if 8 can be called good). To date Mega Man 8 remains the best looking game of the series, and given that this entry to the series came out in the late 90s making a comparable 2D side-scroller comparable to its predecessor could have been done on the cheap as well. It would not have been much more of an investment for Capcom to put some real effort into this game beyond spikes... and more spikes, and still more spikes.... Oh and did I mention spikes? In fact why don't they just do a Spike Man robot mater at this point and get it over with?
  At this point someone will have to tell me if they fixed these problems for Mega Man 10 because I have a rule, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Mega Man 8 and 9 were utter disasters. I don't think I can stomach the idea of laying down any more money for what has become a series only enjoyable to sadomasochists. Mega Man 9 defines deep hurting and should be avoided even by longtime fans of the series.",neutral

1085,"Nightmare Creatures for the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 was easily one of the best survival horror games of all time with huge 3D enviroments, bone chilling stages, slightly good graphics, and superb controls. When the sequel came out, lets just say, it didn't come out to be as great. Well....actually...it wasn't great at all. This was probably the most horrible idea Konami and Kallisto came up with. The graphics are lame. It's like playing a PlayStation game on the Dreamcast. The controls are okay, but when you attack your opponent, it will take more than just two or three hits to kill your enemy. The AI is barely responsive! The zombies only give you a single hit, leaving you a chance to hit them even more until they can't take it anymore and give you a fatality and heck, it doesn't even kill you until you have a short amount of energy. Audio-wise, the voice acting is pretty cool. The main character can really put a lot of effort in his voice while he's telling the story. And if you guys out there are hardcore Rob Zombie fans (I hate Rob Zombie), you'll like the music they put in here. Mostly, some people would just buy games for their soundtracks. I'd say, don't just buy the game just because of the music. Buy it for its superb play controls, detailed graphics, and ultimate replay value. Obviously, Nightmare Creatures II is seriously lacking these features. Nightmare Creatures II is just another letdown exposed on the PlayStation and Dreamcast. Some people found this game very interesting, but I didn't. In my opinion, games this bad deserve a one night rental. If you're in need for a great survival horror game for the Dreamcast, get Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil Code Veronica, or Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare.

When I think about Dynasty warriors and how much variety it has, this game really is just trying to pull the 'sex sells' act and spend a month throwing together a game and put 'bikini' in the title because they know it cannot compete with it's peers.

The game can be fun if you haven't experienced others in its genre.  But it is short, the game has little replay value with only 3 characters (compared to near 100 in some games), and overall any comparison you make to any other recent game in the genre is basically terrible.

1105,"I would've given this two stars, but there's entirely too much to hate as compared to the original.

I absolutely loved the first TF. When I heard they were launching it, I nearly lost my mind. Then, I played the beta. I was beyond heartbroken. They essentially gutted the spirit of what made TF1 so beautiful. They essentially remade the game into something akin to a Call of Duty: Black Ops in Space

So, against my better judgment, I bought the game anyway. I played the multiplayer for about four hours. I seriously wanted nothing more than to like the sequel. I even tried to force myself to play it for about 2-hours longer than when I became bored.

ARTWORK

Some things are better looking such as the lobby animations. However, overall, the artwork doesnt give that detailed gritty feeling that you got from the original. Theres a lot less detail and the maps are much smaller.

Furthermore, the maps are NOT geared towards the parkour movement of the original. The maps are just not well designed for the feel of what one would expect to be a Titanfall branded game.

In TF-1, the colors are muted and realistic looking. In TF-2, things look cartoony with a loud color palette. You feel like you're at an arcade playing one of those shooters with the toy rifles and everything is just coming at you in all the colors of the rainbow.

GAMEPLAY

Instead of a blanket upgrading system where your upgrades allow you access to certain weapons, theyve added more granularity by making weapons upgradable as well. So, you might start with a Level 1 rifle that can be leveled up and upgraded accordingly. This is while you're leveling up as a pilot which allows you access to more advanced weapons in each class.

The titans weapons and characteristics cannot be interchangeable in the way that we saw with TF1. Some of the secondary abilities can be changed. However, titans can be upgraded within the context of their static loadout. So, what you see is what you get for the most part. I actually like that I could use three different chassis and arm them with customizable loadouts. To me, this seemed like a better way to adapt/develop the choices to ones play style. With TF-2, I pretty much have to commit to a certain Titan vs a certain package of features.

The final straw for me was the implementation of the shield dome. In TF-1, if you called on a Titan, youd have a shield dome protecting the Titan for a short period of time. You could get a Titan customization that could extend this time. Now, in TF-2, you either get the shield dome or the titan warp customization. Why is this important? If you're trying to make a tactical move involving a Titan that you cant immediately jump into, then you're SOL. Your Titan falls and is immediately taking damage.

There aren't as many of the Grunts and Androids to kill. I liked these because it was cool to shoot them. Many dislike the Smart Pistol, but I loved it as a primary weapon. It actually increased the hazard of the warzone. It made you a better player if someone was using it against you and there wasn't a guarantee that you would dominate if you were using it. Now, its been completely neutered as a perk that can only be used with 24 rounds. Wow. Just wow.

Speaking of primary weapons. Heres where the absurdity of the game decisions reaches a pinnacle. Pilots can ONLY carry a primary weapon and  wait for it  a pistol OR anti-titan weapon!!! So, yeah, you run out of ammo on your primary weapon and no quick switching to a nice pistol if you want to kill Titans also. So, theyve effectively neutered the pilot. [Game developers, what were you thinking?]

CUSTOMIZATION

Theyve added more customization abilities such as the ability to reskin your weapons and your Titan. This includes patches and team names. What I don't like about it is that it seems like they just through this feature on without much thought on the actual UI. Its a bit confusing to implement.

Did I say you can only have two weapons at a time while a pilot? Primary + pistol or primary + Anti-Titan?

SUMMARY

I could go on about other things. This game feels like they fired the original team during early development. Then hired a whole new team that never worked on or played the original. This new team was confused so they looked over the notes of the previous team and then made the best game that they could. Another theory is that since they went multiplatform, they couldn't use Microsoft's  Azure cloud abilities to do much of the heavy backend lifting as was the case in the original. Hence, they had to make a lite game and used the COD: Black Ops resources/model to fill in the gaps.",positive

1107,"You gotta be kiddin' me.  What a sorry excuse to use the GoldenEye title to sell games.  Automatically, gamers will think about the original GoldenEye for the N64 (...)to this day in comparison to other shooter multiplayer games.  If I wanted to see cartoons, I'd watch Bugs Bunny.  This game took a major step backwards.  Nothing seems lifelike.  Forget about stealth.  You can basically go blasting through levels without any thought and make it through with little resistence.

1108,"3 words, Always on DRM. (I guess that is technically six)  This could be great game but you can't play offline, ie on the airplane or a place you don't have the internet. For a game where there is no social element required, though it is a nice add on here, that is ridiculous.  If all my software was like this I might as well not own a laptop.  So, I am going to call this a desktop only game, that is assuming EA fixes the servers on their side which is another ball of wax entirely.",positive
1109,"So I was watching, playing the demo, and someone else's copy.  I honestly fell in love with this game and ready to drop my money on it, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't like to spend much money on games.  The thing that stop me is the amount of bugs that I've been through, campaign trigger bugs and what not.  Sure, I'll probably need to get full version and update to get it working.  What really stop me is the DRM reviews online.  I honestly don't feel like I would have a real ownership of the game.  Ubisoft, DRM doesn't stop piracy, it stop customers to purchase your game.  I honestly want to play with people online.  But now, forget it.  I thought only EA blew it, but I guess you too.  Thanks Ubisoft, unless you change your policy, I'll never drop a bug on DRM games ever.",positive
1110,"Well the reason i hate pc gaming now is all the bugs, clitches, DRM, Securom, having to download games now rather than pic them up at gamestop, and all the other garbage that goes along with copying games. I must admit i have downloaded a few in my time but i realized its just not worth it when you can purchase it and ""attempt"" to enjoy it from the store. Gamestop doesnt even sell PC games anymore, Best Buy is about the only place to find them. The main reason for its demise is that people never know when to stop finding ways to get around the games copy them for free and share them with everyone else. If people weren't so lazy and cheap they would have jobs and go purchase games like real adult should. Music is a different story, CD sales may be suffering because of MP3 downloaded but thats because people want them because you just download it from here, or even for free. And no musicians are suffering or walking the streets broke because of it, they make there money on touring anyways. So back to computer gaming, the DRM, and Securom you find on most games doesn't even really effect how the game plays and with windows seven doesnt really slow down or damage anything at all on your PC. In my experience i only have one case when playing Dead Space, that it wiped out all of my songs from my hard drive because most i had downloaded through the years using Soulseek, a free download service. A game is worth paying for, to me, if you like it buy it, and play it. Music is different because people don't want to buy a cd that sucks or has 3 good song and then let it sit on the shelf and collect dust for years. I agree there are some shady deals gong down with having to be on the net, and spyware and actual viruses being put on games. The only hope you really have is don't order it but download it from direct2drive, or gamersgate, where is 90% of cases the DRM or Securom is removed because there is NO way it can be copied or burnt to disc. But as i said the reason for this is peoples dishonesty and just having to copy the game and then try to take it back or just share it with 100's of other people. Movies are slowly but surely dying as well with Netflix, Xbox Zune Videos, and PS3 Network. Its a shame but we live in a digital world now, and we have made it that way. So given that we have the ability and computer distributors knew burners had the means to do it, we have ourselves and also them to blame. Thanks Microsoft for ruining what use to be a thriving market. Now look at all the horrid reviews on 85% of PC games.

Btw, the game itself is great and much better than the first, but no one else is bring that up and they are just ranting about the DRM and having to have internet to play, so i thought i would rant also. Thanks.",positive
1111,"I was eagerly awaiting this game and all the excellent reviews it received made me happy to finally have it in my hands. What can I say; I should have paid closer attention to the reader reviews, and not the biased reviews of game journalists that line their pockets with free gifts and ad revenue from Activision.

Without spoiling anything, I can safely tell you that the story of MW2 can be completed in less than 5 hours. I took my time and explored the game. I was extremely disappointed to find out that the game is so short, but it is being touted as a ""multiplayer"" game, so I quickly jumped on line.

Let me say that my experience with the game was even worse from that point on. I had friends drop from matches, and everyone was experiencing a lot of lag. We could not host the matches ourselves, and there are no dedicated servers, so the game would automatically pick the ""best"" host, causing our ping's to shoot up into the high 150's for most matches, sometimes reaching all the way into the 300+.

What came as an even greater surprise was the fact that the game caps out at 9 vs 9 matches. Apparently 9 vs 9 is a ""multiplayer"" experience. All my hopes of large scale battles went away. Why does a PC game only support 9 vs 9 matches? What happened to 64 vs 64, or at least 32 vs 32. Imagine killing the same 9 people over and over again during the course of the match. Where is the fun in that?

Soon after we encountered another issue. We could not kick players that would cheat or idle. This made some of the matches become basically 3 vs 5, and completely ruin the fun. Also when the ""host"" of the game leaves (remember, the game picks the ""best"" host for you) there is a delay before it finds another host. During this delay everyone basically waits and twiddles their thumbs.

Eventually we tried to figure out how to chat amongst ourselves... And we could not do so! The game has no party chat. What ""multiplayer"" game in this day and age has no party chat? Communicating with your team members is essential, but this is absent from the game!

I can go on and on about the huge lag spikes, higher price point, lack of console access, weird exploits that render your opponent immortal, but why bother? I believe I already made my point that you should NOT be buying this game on the PC.

If you want a great FPS, wait for Battlefield Bad Company 2, which not only has all the features Modern Warfare 2 is missing, but actually looks like it will have the support of the modding community, which Modern Warfare 2 does not.",neutral
1112,"its such a lazy effort

instead of creating their own guitar like rockband or guitar hero

1120,"I played Armored Princess first, then I played The Dark Side... Loved them both, especially the Dark Side. Then I made a mistake of buying The Legend.

To begin with, this is the first game in the series and it is inferior in every way imaginable to both of the sequels, especially compared to the Dark Side which has TONS more of everything in terms of content, features, units, quests, items and so on. So, if you played either Armored Princess or the Dark Side, you should skip The Legend.

But The Legend's inferiority to the sequels is the least of its problems. The REAL problem is that The Legend still has many bugs - many small ones, but also a couple of HUGE ones:

- Some quests are bugged and cannot be completed (at level 14 I already encountered two such quests);

- Some NPCs which clearly should be interactive are not interactive;

- And then there is the Ice Spirit Lina bug. You rely on your spirits in The Legend as you would rely on your pet dragon in Armored Princess or on Blackie in the Dark Side to prevail in combat, but one of the four of your spirits (Lina) cannot be activated. I uninstalled/reinstalled the game, followed other suggestions I found on the forums where users discuss this exact problem - nothing works for me: When I get to the energy source to recharge Lina, I can click on it, but nothing happens and her dialogue options do not change to where she agrees ""to serve"" me.

Bottom line, even if you never played any of the King's Bounty games, just skip The Legend. It is still half-broken, will never be fixed and it is a waste of time (as you will need at least 150, maybe 200 hours to finish it).

Get Armored Princess or Dark Side or both. Oh, and finally The Legend is very unbalanced in terms of the enemies you encounter - a good number of quests you get at level 3 cannot be completed until level 14+ and STILL you will lose 90% of your army while fighting quest enemies.

1125,I did not like this game at all. I don't like communicating with still pictures. There is no direction for you to follow. You could wander around for a long time not knowing where to go and what to do. This is one of the worst games I have ever played.,negative
1126,"I have 30 hours into this movie/game, because I refused to believe Square would come out with a movie in the guise of a game. And FFX is just that. A movie with limited (and I mean LIMITED) player interaction, on a level with the horrible Xenogears. There are NO camera angle changes, and no 360 degree control. The game is TOTALLY and completely linear. You spend the first two hours watching young Tidus, a supposedly great blitzball player, whine and whimper about `his old man' disappearing when he was young. Not only is the voice over emotionally inconsistant, the pitch is irritable. AND YOU CANNOT X-MASH THROUGH THE SCENES! The `game' is in complete control thoughout. The plot is entangled (and I mean in knots) with religious conflict and political manipulation, the intricacies of which, as an adult, I understood and enjoyed. As a teen, I wouldn't tolerate it, and would be horrified when I found YOU CANNOT BYPASS A SINGLE SCENE THROUGHOUT THE GAME. While most of the backdrops are graphically superior, there is little exploration allowed. Your characters run only only on paths in area scenes, and there is NO world scene, and no control over destination. You only go where the game sends you. (I have 30 hours in, I hope it changes...)
But there are some redeeming factors here. If you don't mind watching another `Final Fantasy: Spirits Within' movie, you are in luck. The computer graphics are absolutely breathtaking. As far as ganes go, FFX is the CG feather in Square's cap,  especially the ocean scenes involving Sin, the mega-whale sized creature bent on destruction. I have never seen creatures and water displayed with such realism. On land, the trees sway, and I wish Square had invested as much time in the gameplay as they did making everyone's hair move in the breeze. The voice-overs were a step up in reading text after text after text (I turned the text off and just listened...)The battle scenes are copied from FFIX with a few graphic enhancements. The `sphere' grid' is a new way of powering up and learning spells, and is the most amusing part of the game. Weapons do not get stronger (you buy/find ones with different attributes) which is diappointing. Now for the Aeons, your summoned beings. There are only 4, taken from FFIX, with some very nice enhanced graphics. Unfortunately, the summoning scenes are excrutiatingly long (at least 15 seconds each and every time. Apparently Square was so enamured with the graphics, you CANNNOT shorten them as in prior FF games. You might as well get up and make a sandwich everytime you summon), so you prefer to leave Yuna, the heroine out of the battles. The sphere grid is a neat new way of upping HP and MP, and is actually challenging to maze through.  The side game of Blitz is fair, but I found the control buttons do not respond per the instructions. You'll see. And, the game controls the matches. I prefered the card games in FF VIII and IX. And for you mothers of 12 year old boys, FFX graphics are true to EVERY scantily clad female body movement, so be ready for Lulu the Black Mage.
I play nothing but RPG's and Res-Evil style games. RPG stands for Role Playing Game. There is little to be had here except for moving the characters in and out of the battle scenes. I have 30 hours into this game only because I couldn't believe Square would come out with another game/movie (guess I forgot Xenogears) As a game, this falls so far short. As an example of computer graphic capabilities, Square has given us the showcase of the year. And I do mean a showcase. This is the feather in Square's graphics cap.
I have played every FF game, as well as almost every RPG made. I cannot recommend you buy this as a game, new. I would wait a week for the movies fans to return theirs, and buy it then. Since it is totally linear, without skip capabilities, I would not rent this. You will have it a while. Perhaps I will update this after I finish the `game', unless I just get sick of it and move on.
There are several other Square games much more suited to GAMING. I recommend FF IX most highly, as well as ChronoCross (very nicely done), the sequel to ChronoTrigger. Also try, Legend of Dragoon, Star Ocean: Second Story, and Breath of Fire III. For Dreamcast, try Skies of Arcadia. 50 hours of total 360 degree control through an extremely vast world.",positive

So you have to find your way back to the entrance (good luck) and buy a cap with the points you have earned shaking characters hands and picking up trash.

Graphically, this game is definitely an early gen game.  I've seen some people mention online as a redeeming feature, just do yourself a favor and buy Blur if you want a true online experience (no other racer on the market lets you race 20 to a room).

Pros: comfortable material, good quality sound, deep lows, removeable mic, can be adjusted easily, thick and durable cable, big mute button on the volume adjuster piece.

Cons: If you have a average to large sized head, it will not be comfortable.  The two ear pieces are not as shown in the pictures.  If you were to lay them down on the table the ear pieces naturally come to together, as if there is a lot of tension on the band that holds them to the top piece.

1147,"Sony Online Entertainment makes great games when they are original, such as Everquest, and even Everquest 2.  But every intellectual property they aquire, from The Matrix to Star Wars - they kill it.

Honestly how can you ruin a game based on something as immensely popular as Star Wars?  Especially so soon in the afterglow of the Episode III DVD release?

SOE shows you how - through doing the exact opposite of what you are taught in every Customer Service class you will ever attend.

1.) Lie to the customers

SOE has lied, constantly, as it relates to changes being made.  A recent lie was advertisements for the latest expansion to Star Wars Galaxies - and promises of new items, etc. for certain professions.  1 Day after charging customers who pre-ordered the expansion - charges fresh on the credit card bills - SOE announced changes to the game which ELIMINATED 21 professions and forced you into one of 9 professions which were broken horribly.

This was actionable enough for a lawsuit that they were forced to give a refund to customers - but of course that took 2 - 7 weeks to process.

2. Don't listen to the customer.

Customer asks for a bug fix?  Offer him an expansion for the modest sum of $30.  Want the bug fix bad enough?  Fork over the $30 or we won't make it.  Character bugged?  Spent 3 years building him up to the level he's at?  Delete him - we can't be bothered to fix him.

3. Call every nerf, everything that changes in the game, etc. to make it more ""Star Warsy"".

""Star Warsy"" is a madeup term crafted in the SOE spin department.  This term was generated in order to say ""I was making things more Star Warsy"" instead of being forced to say ""I was just making 90% of the items you've aquired over the past year worthless.""

Not only do they nerf the players to the point of unplayability - they leave the enemies stronger than ever.

1165,"As a die-hard fan of the series, I held out hope. Hope that the critical reviews and widespread hate were unfounded. But alas, hope deferred maketh the heart sick.

First of all, there are 4 divisions of currency you need to be aware of. You have typical money (that doesn't come easy... or at all... if you don't know exactly what you're doing). You have synchronization points, creed points, and helix points. All of which are burdened with troubles.

-Money: Unlike previous games, there's not an immediately clear way to generate income. What makes it worse is that every form of consumable is immensely expensive. And with the reintroduction of medicine over health regen, you have to deal with yet another depleting resource that actually changes in price... up to a few grand. For one. So when you get the opportunity to improve the theater, to do theater missions, and renovate social clubs drop EVERYTHING and complete them. I made the mistake of completing the main story before understanding the mechanism. As a result, I could never afford the gear I wanted and literally did nothing but watch my meager funds disappear every time I needed to use consumables.

-Synch points: You get these for completing the story missions. Obvious, right? Not a problem there. However... what do they buy? Well, I'm sorry to break it to you but you'll need to acquire these points to gain access to incredibly basic functions that should be as standard as walking. Want a double assassination? Not only must you pay one of the higher prices for this ability but you have to wait to the final stretch of the game to even access the function. No more logical plot points that grant you a second blade - just buy it instead! What's more, to perform this double assassination from the air is a SEPARATE expense. You literally have to buy the same function twice to use it to the fullest and only in the final quarter of the game. Jump from an average height? I hope you bought ""roll recovery"" so Arno doesn't snap his knees and die! But moving on...

-Creed points: Earned for doing assassin-y things like killing and running and hiding and using lifts. All normal aspects of playthrough. However their purpose is to grant you access to new dyes (meaning you can't just try them all out once you're rich) and to upgrade every single piece of gear available (because why not add another unnecessary complication to the gaming experience?)

-Helix points: Just in case you weren't already disillusioned by pedantic functions and mechanics, you can just pay cash to win the game.

-Aside from the currency, there's plenty more to disappoint. While the parkour mechanics are designed to look dynamic and fresh, they will be a constant source of irritation. Despite accurate button input, Arno may simply not move, jump, or climb in any direction you input from the controller - especially helpful in timed portions when your life depends on it. But that won't matter too much if the game crashes instead, so don't worry about it too much!

-It would, however, be a problem if you were a completionist. If you liked to acquire all the trappings, all the gear, all the customizables, and so forth. Why, you ask? Mostly because you could play the game thrice over and still not afford half the gear - and God forbid you want all the weapons, too! Who do you think you are, Donald Trump?!

-That said, you could pick all the locked chests that are revealed by viewpoints. Oh shoot, I forgot... you won't see them all unless you use Helix points to buy the treasure map! Drat. But if you DO spend the money, you'll literally be blinded by the sheer quantity of red chest icons on your map. Hope you were done with the story cause you'll NEVER your next destination marker.

-Ahh, but at least you have the story of a young assassin to fall back on, right? Right? As long as you're a fan of incongruent flashbacks that fall out of place, of random jumps in time that make no sense whatsoever other than to see the Eiffel Tower in wartime, of a realtively corrupt assassin order that... you know what, I give up.",negative

1168,"I have never ever bought a game and wished I didn't, not even Codename S.T.E.A.M or Regular Show in 8-bit land. I HATE those games, but I do not regret the purchase because I enjoy the collecting.

I hate this game. My copy from amazon would not work (not fault on Amazon's part most likely) so I bought another copy from Gamestop and I am regretting it all the way. I want to set this cartridge on fire.

If you're looking for a game to fill a hole in your heart that Bravely Default left, after completing every possible thing you can in it, keep looking. This game is grindy to the point that I find it unbearable. I am SHOCKED it has 5 star review on amazon. I spent 3 hours trying to grind to get past the second map that I went to explore and I *STILL* cannot clear the boss there. AND THERE IS NO OPTION TO RUN FROM THE BOSS?!?!!?! If it's one you accidentally run on you should be able to flee. Seeing as how you lose ALL EXPLORED MAP PROGRESS if you die, running around to grind or explore and running into a boss and getting your tushy handed to you and not being able to get away from it is cruel.

I looked it up to see what else I could do to make it less hard. I love grindy games. I love Diablo, I played Ragnarok Online for YEARS and WoW for even more. But I hate this game. The random level up system is awful. The battle system is sub-par at best. The best thing it has going for it is the ridiculously too large breasts on Eloise which I find not entirely necessary (and I draw porn for a living so that's saying something).

I am so disappointed in this game. I am disappointed in Atlus. After how great Bravely Default was I didn't expect to hate this game so much. I'm going to give it to someone I do not like for Christmas. I don't even want the box or the lovely soundtrack I hate it so much.",negative
1169,"Waste of money. Buy it for the Wii instead. The DS version of Ultimate Alliance 2 has such a narrow character selection that this alone dissuaded me from playing for very long. The graphics were quite terrible for how innovative the console is. A weak port intended as a cash grab that followed the massive marketing campaign this game had. Obviously, the cartridges for the DS have severely limited space compared to disc-based consoles, but the programming must be relatively more difficult since the developers are working with hardware over software; however, I'm no expert on computer science. All in all, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, like it's predecessor, is actually an amazingly stellar game, but do not waste your money on this version, indulge in the Wii version. The nunchaku and motion sensor controls work extremely well with beat-'em-up and hack-'n-slash games like this. Plus, the inclusion of luscious Hi-Def cut-scenes and the entourage of characters MAKE the game. There are a million and one games out there featuring your standard Spiderman and Thor characters, so when I play a game featuring Marvel heroes and heroines, I want to try the less typical ones. Playing as Psylocke or Blade or the Human Torch was much more enjoyable than Iron Man and Wolverine, of whom we see too much of.

As a purchaser, I would only consider buying this version of the game for a younger child without much video game experience or fastidiousness. This version of what is otherwise an amazing title is definitely not for video game connoisseur.",positive
1170,"Firstly, I've had liberal views (call me a moderate) but this one broke the camel's back for me. I normally only write good reviews on Amazon. But as I said, this one broke the camel's back for me.

Buy this game if you want to constantly have the LGBTQ (or whatever the acronym is) agenda constantly forced down your throat at every turn. If you want flirt options with every guy popping up in most conversations (or girl if you're a female), if you want to walk by and overhear a side conversation about a woman and her girlfriend having a baby (really), homosexual only romance options (Suvi for example), and other constant and unnecessary such content force fed to you CONSTANTLY to the point that it is very IMMERSION-BREAKING, then... Go ahead and buy this hot mess. Oh and PS - They also purposefully uglified the female characters (kind of insulting to women I think).

Otherwise, the game itself. Nothing like the previous series as you probably already heard. Yawn-inducing commentary and conversations. Good gun sounds so far and decent combat. No better than the original though. A couple of new innovations such as jet booster packs that let you jump in the air and side to side. Neat addition. But nothing here to make me suffer the ultra-liberal agenda that is force-fed to you thereby destroying any immersion. And as I said, I tend to lean liberal on topics. But this is too much.",positive
1171,"great game, but the port to vita sucks. there's no real frame rate drops but if there's too much happening or (more likely) things are going TOO fast (as in driving around, especially running mobs over, hell even going in the menu and trying to do things fast before it even finishes loading) can literally crash the Vita. the whole system just freezes........  It'l normally shut itself off in 30 seconds, then you just turn it on again..... but once it didn't. I had to hold the power button for like 20 seconds to bring up safe mode and TELL it to restart.....

Basically, it's a great game to have for on the go and trips.... it'll take a long time just to beat on ONE character (I played for like a week and a half on a two week trip and didn't even finish), but you need to take your time or risk crashing. Let the menu's load before you hit a button, don't hit L or R to go to a different section fast (as in spam it fast), let areas load before you move (you'll see surfaces dont' load right away, especially vending machines and the walls by the transporter in Sanctuary).  Save the game as soon as you finish a mission (or .... every two hours or so if you're just running around), quit, close the game and reboot it. Follow those rules and hopefully you wont' ever crash.

And go here for Shift Codes for Golden Keys (all codes ever released): [...]
It shows which keys are still valid, and it's still being updated as of now... There are so many that still work you'll literally spend an entire day putting them all in. I suggest connecting a Bluetooth keyboard to your vita to make it easier.  Dont' /follow Randy Pitchford or Gearbox on Twitter for posts of new codes unless you want to be spammed with a ton of other useless crap.

I dont' think it matters but I'm not on a newer Vita, I have the white one from the AC Liberation bundle. and it's never failed anything before.

Update summer 2016: I'm lowering my rating to one star... This is the most broken game I've ever seen in my life. I only play it on my yearly trips (which is pretty much only when I use my vita anyway xcept for big titles in the past like AC and Uncharted GA), so I'm still not done with this title. I'm lvl 26, and pretty much have spent ALL of lvl 26 trying to get through the first two quest in the Wildlife Preserve, like Wildlife Preservation. I cant' even get through the damn area cause it keeps freezing on me near the end. It doesn't matter WHAT is happening. It's frozen going in the menu, it's frozen going to a vending machine to sell drops and restock, it's frozen JUST MOVING TOWARDS DROPS after killing a mob! I think I have literally spent an entire week trying to do this area. I just hit 27, I remember hitting 26.... I'm about to try running through the entire area not stopping to do ANYTHING unless I HAVE to kill something (like that really painful big bot that comes out of the doors before the caged area).That's not how you want to play any game..... just rushing through ignoring everything.......

DO NOT BUY THIS PORT. Crappiest port on the planet!.....  Just buy the damn console version if you want to play this game.....

1173,"I bought the Xbox version and was disappointed to see that the schedules are generated incorrectly after the first season. I bought the PS2 version -- same crap! How can you suckers out there possibly say Madden 05 is going to be dethroned? Are you complete idiots? Look morons, the NFC West plays the NFC South this season. In season two the NFC West should play the NFC East. In season three the NFC West should play the NFC North. IT NEVER HAPPENS!!! THE NFC WEST KEEPS PLAYING THE NFC SOUTH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!! That means counting the division opponets you get only six different opponets a season when you should get at least ten. ESPN knows much about presentation, but nothing about how NFL schedules work. The game is fun in year one, but after that all of you simulation fans will be gravely disappointed. If you're a moron who doesn't know any better this game is for you. There is no f! cking way in h! ll this game is better than Madden 05 and the beautiful thing about it is that I don't even have to play Madden 05 to know that (it isn't released yet). SEGA got $39.98 out of me so I guess I'm just as much of a sucker as the rest of you nitwits who write reviews before you thoroughly investigate a game. Just about all of this game's features are pointless -- the practice sessions that bring your stats down instead of up (so much for practice), the crib (dumb), the ""player of the game"" interviews (an endless cliche spewing machine). Soon you will be pressing the button to skip all of them to start the next game and shutting off the ""Weekly Preparation"" option. Dethrone Madden???? Yeah, right. SEGA can't even make a f! cking schedule right and that has been a problem with their football games since the Dreamcast. All of you out there will vote that this review didn't help you and even write counter reviews debating this issue. You've got to get the schedules right to be a serious contender.

1177,"I finally bought this game about a week ago after reading amazing reviews on it, and I must say I felt very mislead. I was expecting at least a little bit more of a traditional RPG with more realistic game play. TWEWY was far from what I expected. From the first time I booted it up, I thought ""oh no.. this looks cheesy - I'm going to hate this game"", but I gave it a chance anyway. After way too much ridiculous dialogue involving two characters that you can't help but hate, the game finally begins (sort of..). I finally got into the combat part of the game, which I absolutely hate. It feels like a mix of Dance Dance Revolution and Final Fantasy 2. You are expected to control two characters at once: one at the top of your screen, and the other at the bottom. On the bottom you run around in an extremely limited space using different attacks while trying to avoid the enemy. While doing this, you are expected to follow a pattern of buttons to push to control the character on the top screen, which I have found impossible, as I am not a chamelean and my eyes do not look in different directions at once. If you ignore the bottom screen for more than a second, you get bombarded by enemies. After trying to figure it out, I found it too difficult to resist the urge to destroy my DS by slamming it against the coffee table, so I just left the top screen on autoplay (which apparently the autoplay does a terrible job and makes it impossible to achieve higher than a C on any battle, which hinders game play.)

  So now I officially hate: the gameplay, the characters, and the combat. I decide ""Hell, 98% of people on Amazon loved the game, so lets keep going and try and see what they see."" I played a few more hours, gathered a few more ""pins"", and all I discovered is that 98% of people on Amazon are morons. I must say though, I hate the characters a little bit less. But I definitely hate the game much more. Boss battles have become extremely difficult because I have no choice but let the computer control my 2nd character - but wait! I have the ability to switch the game to ""easy"". I read reviewers say they like this aspect, but to me it's a cop out. Square Enix failed to make a consistent game and decided it would be easier to have us switch difficulties throughout the game than to fix it. In this reviewers opinion, Square Enix failed to make a tolerable game. I am surprised to see that anyone enjoyed it, and baffled as to how so many people loved it. Hands down one of the worst games I have ever played, and this is coming from a huge Square Enix fan.

1179,"I bought this because I was excited about some of the new games that were coming out exclusively for xbox one, and I was eager to see the graphics and gameplay improvements. Sadly, this machine has been nothing but a disappointment thus far, so much so that I've barely played it. Anyone looking to buy should know a few things:

-It takes HOURS to actually load and play a game. I bought this one with ""Ryse: Son of Rome"" and I had to keep both the machine and controller turned on (checking in every 30 mins) for about 8 hours before it was playable. Gone are the days of inserting a disc and playing immediately. So far, it's failed to load 2 other games I purchased (it claims they're installed, but won't launch them and I don't have the patience to babysit this thing while it strains to reinstall them)

-This was marketed as a device that would integrate into your home theater, that you could simply command to switch from TV to gaming to movies. While it integrates well into cable/satellite, it doesn't play well with home theaters. There is only 1 HDMI input in the back, so you're kind of screwed if you have other devices (like your old Xbox 360) that you periodically use.

-Kinect is horrible at recognizing hand gestures. You're better off finding the controller and using it.

-No backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 games. I'm sure this is a marketing ploy more than a hardware issue, and it's a shame. I might not be such an angry customer if there were actually a few games that were immediately playable.

Are the graphics good? Sure. The voice commands are kinda cool, too. But you give up a lot with this machine, and I don't think the trade-offs are worth the novelty. Mine is presently unplugged because I'm having more fun replaying old Xbox 360 games than the single game I've been able to install. I hope to God that the people responsible for some of these shortcomings lose their careers over this piece of crap.

1184,"Star Wars Galaxies has been repackaged and resold several times since it came out in 2002/2003.  The first ""re-release"" came about about the time of Episode 3.  About 6 months later, the game was re-released as the ""NGE"" i.e. ""New Game Experience"".  After upsetting its player base to the point of a mass exodus to other games such as World of Warcraft, EvE Online, and others - SOE redesigned the game *AGAIN* and has re-released it in this ""Complete Adventures"" set.  About six months ago it was the ""Starter Kit"".  And in about another month it will be released *AGAIN* as part of the  ""Best of Star Wars"" gift set.

This game is in perpetual Alpha/Beta state depending on how much code they delete between patches.  It is not fun at all anymore.  I made a lot of friends through the original SWG - but they have been milking the Star Wars license for all its worth to comedic dramatic effect - culminating in embarrassing gaffes on the Game Channel ""Attack of the Show"" as well as CBS Specials detailing some of the atrocities committed by SOE - and also written articles and a ""mailbag"" special.

Most of the players who had any sort of self-repsect whatsoever left a long time ago.

The only people playing this game right now can be equated to the women who go back to their abusive husbands because he promises not to beat them again.

It is only a matter of time before you have to tell your parents that you ""Fell down the stairs"" the next time you beat your head into your computer desk after SOE pulls the rug out from under you with a new ""Star Warsy"" ""enhancement"" that negates most of your time spent with your character in-game.

Things have gotten so bad with the server population that SOE has given all characters an extra character slot per server... something that used to be reserved for players which earned certain rewards in-game.

You can be a Jedi out of the box... but your powers are so ridiculously weak, and your lightsaber so flaccid that you will lose fights to the most ridiculous creatures... cavemen, correllian butterflies, and all sorts of other ""dangerous"" beasts.

Plot: as generic as it gets. By the end of the day, you won't remember a single character from this game or what it was about. The concept of ninjas using guns just seems silly anyways. 2/10

Graphics: clunky and blocky, rather poor even for 2002. Textures are EXTREMELY bad and make the game a serious eye-sore. 4/10

Sound: overall it's okay. The music is so monotonous and bland it's barely there. Most of the voice acting is stale and lifeless. 4/10

Gameplay: You just blast away and reload when needed. That's really the only strategy in this game. Being completely exposed to attack forces the player to always kill enemies quickly. The only time you'll have to catch your breath is when the next level is loading. It doesn't feel satisfying to finish a level or beat a boss, you'll just be wondering how much longer it is until the game is over. 3/10

Final Thoughts: Pass this one up. It'll entertain you for a weekend at best. I played it for a day and quickly grew bored. There are some alternative story and training modes to mix things up, but I didn't bother with them. If you want good light gun action on the PS2, get Time Crisis 3.

They should have called this game, The Force Unleashed II:  MOTS.

What is MOTS, you ask?!?  Mantra Of The Sith?!?  No, it's MORE OF THE SAME.

Sadly, LucasArts has moved from a game that has released exciting titles to extremely pretty, 5-word mission statements.  With the original Force Unleashed, the mission statement for the programmers (and I'm NOT making this up), was ""Kicking A** With The Force!""  What resulted was a single-minded experience that turned into a bore-fest of, ""oh, a stormtrooper...*yawn*...lightning bolt him?  Toss him aroung like a rag doll while choking him?  Toss a lightsaber into him?"" while he shoots at me with single-minded stupidity as I deflect his shots with my saber.  Oh, look...an obstacle on a linearly-constructed level.  Do I go around it?  Wait, use the Force to blast through it a 27th time?  Really?  I...did...not...see...that...coming!

Ultimately, the original Force Unleashed turned into a ""how do I get to the next cutscene so I can look at something else besides endless hordes of Bantha fodder occasionally interrupted by 'God-of-War lifted context-sensitive boss fights.'""  By the time that I got to the end, my character was so incredibly endowed with force powers, it made Luke Skywalker (from Return of the Jedi) look like a whelp.  Apprentice, Vader?  Yeah, right.

I was hoping that the Force Unleashed II would offer something new.  It does:  a couple of new ways to ""kick a** with the force.""  Beyond that, MOTS.  Congratulations, LucasArts, for taking THE SAME 5-word sentence and wrapping a game around it.  PS - LucasArts laid off 30 of their software developers prior to this game's release.  Read into that whatever message you'd like.

""But, seriously,"" you may ask, ""What do you know?  You only played a complete DEMO.""  Here's the 5-and-dime on this, folks.  The purpose of ANY GOOD marketing exercise is to showcase your game's BEST features in order to entice you to buy the full game.  Uncharted 2 is a great example of this; the game throws you into Chapter 5 of the game (about 1/4 way through) and chucks you into an action-packed level full of bad guys (who actually think, take cover, and generally do a good job of NOT being cannon fodder).  The Force Unleashed II shows me that LucasArts has learned NOTHING if this is the BEST that the game has to offer.  The Force Unleashed II (yeah, THAT rolls off the tongue) ultimately becomes similar to what Episodes 1 - 3 did for Episodes 4 - 6 -- The Force Unleashed (compared to Jedi Outcast) is all about the eye candy without any actual substance or sense of adventure.

1198,"This is a horrible port to pc.  The game was designed for consoles with no forethought to a possible pc port.  I followed this game in it's development but was shocked at how much parkour type mechanics were employed.

I was more shocked that there is only one way to 'win' in every situation.  It's very linear and if you don't do it their way, you lose.

The PC port is so poorly done that you have to look up keybindings on the internet because you can't find them from the game.  You actually can't find anything helpful from the game because they never tell you hot to access anything.

The game suffers from a single-minded parkour type gameplay.  It's like all the designers got together and said, we've got parkour (badly done I might add) and let's make nearly every mission about jumping.

1202,"I have played a lot of games before, and even if a game is bad I try and finish it because I would like to see what happens at the end of the game. I wanted to play this game because I really liked the movie and I was curious what happened between the 30 years in the movie, like the game says you can play through. After shortly playing through it, I just gave up playing it, it wasn't even worth it to try and suck it up to see the ending.

To begin with the graphics are not that great, I know it's a 2007 game, but Final Fantasy 10 had better graphics than this game, hell some psp games have better graphics. I don't mind graphics in a game, if that game is good. The story is changed a bit from the movie, and some weapons he use changes. (*minor spoiler* i.e. The sea monster`s horn instead of a sword). Weapons break way to fast, but in its defense you run into them a lot.

The fighting is ok in this game, but I have played others that have a better fighting system. The only good thing about this game is the bloody kills, and finishing moves. No dismemberment though. You get ""power-ups"" throughout the game, but I only got two of them so far in the game. One makes you powerful, and the other makes your party powerful. If your ""party"" dies its game over and your hits hurt them too, and they get in the way all the time so you end up killing them. The grendle part is the part your party members can die.

The game leans heavily on Quick Time Events and I tend to hate these types of gameplay. Some games do it well, but some make it extremely annoying, i.e. this game.  They even have a music Quick Time Event, but its more annoying than anything. The only cool part was the song Beowulf sung to bring out Grendel.

Overall this game is trying to be a God of War game with Beowulf instead of Kratos, but it failed horribly. I got the game and the movie for 4 dollars together at a sale at Wal-Mart, so I didn't lose that much on it since I really liked the Beowulf movie. I do feel bad for the people who bought this at retail price just to find out how much this game sucks, save your money for another game.

Length: I didn't complete the game because it was so bad, so I don't know the length.

Trophies / Achievements: I don't know its achievements due to playing it on the PC, and I don't recommend trying for them since it would be a very painful process.

*Some kills are nice, but not much

Negatives:
*Bad Graphics
*Changed Story

1216,"The game's netcode is absolutely awful, to the point that the game is unplayable.

The host can come around a corner and kill you by the time you pull the trigger.  It's literally almost impossible to kill the host. especially at close quarters inside buildings.  The host can run around the buildings in the center of every map and clean up against anyone.

It's akin to being a new/bad player going up against pros, except every single game match is like that.

What's less fun than dying over and over again?  Getting kills you don't earn.  The horrible spawn system will at times spawn you directly behind an enemy player or the enemy team for an easy kill that is painfully unsatisfying.  I get no excitement for cheap shotting an enemy player who doesn't have a chance to win.

Other times, the game will spawn an entire team right in front of you, and you'll get wasted instantly.

The host is literally a second ahead of all the other players.  He'll see you and kill you by the time you see him.  It makes close quarters combat miserable.  You'll go around the corner or he'll come around the corner and wham, you're dead.  Watching the kill cam confirms that he put enough bullets into you to kill you, but you never shot him once.

The only counter to the host, is the shotguns, but they're noob weapons with extremely huge spread in the crosshairs, and like spawning behind somebody, it's totally unsatisfying.  I hate killing other players with shotguns, and you will too.

The flaws are so miserable, that I can hardly believe they released the game in this condition.

other 'features' this game has are unlimited sprint and unlimited wallrunning, both of which are invitations to die.  Either option gives you momentum which prevents you from changing direction, which means that you're an extremely easy target for the enemy.  I can't tell you how many times I've killed a sprinting or wallrunning player without even trying.

To make matters worse, you have to blow points on perks to ready your weapon faster, which is the only way to make sprinting a feasible option.

So, basically, all players do is camp.  It's the only viable strategy.

The game is played like this :  There are hardpoints on every map from which to camp from :  a wall, a concrete barricade, a window, basically anything you can camp behind and shoot from without exposing much of your own body to make you an easy target.  In between Hard points is no mans land, being out in the open with no cover, thus exposing your entire body to the enemy.

Being caught in no mans land by enemy players is death.

The only way to advance in the game, is by sprinting from hard point to hard point, spending as little time as possible in no mans land.

I feel like every time I catch an enemy player in no mans land, I get a kill I don't deserve.  I usually never take any damage from these players.  It's almost like executing an unarmed prisoner with a firing squad... there's not a chance in hell they'll survive.  So where's the fun?

There is fun in fair firefights where 2 players both find themselves in no mans land having a firefight.  Or when 2 players find themselves both in cover at hard points, having a firefight from hard point to hard point.

But sadly, these encounters are a rarity.  Most players are not willing to take the risk of entering no mans lands, and for good reason : it's almost impossible to survive.

By camping at a hard point, even if you have a 4 players spawn in front of you, you still have the chance of picking an enemy off before his buddies can flank or rush your position.

But, if you're caught in no mans land against 4 players, you're instantly dead.

I understand why the game suffers from so much lag and host advantage.  They're using peer to peer hosting rather than dedicate servers.

But I do not understand why the spawn system is so awful, and why you must burn so many perks on having any ability to run and gun.

It's just bad, broken game design.  I get no fun out of being killed from behind by a player who spawned directly behind me, and I get even less fun out of killing someone else from behind.

I get no fun out of having an entire team spawn right in front of me and getting wiped out instantly.

I get no fun out of wasting all my perks and points trying to make run and gun viable, when it never really will be and is a total waste of time.

Players who design their class around camping hard points have a huge advantage over players who design their class for run and gun in no mans land.  Players who don't want to camp are punished severely for even trying to attack.

*Some hard points with high ground are grenade and rocket catches.  These 'catch points' are more effective than others, but it's countered by the 'catch' design which makes it easy for someone to throw a grenade or shoot a rocket at you.  It's a nice little risk reward system.  I've gotten a lot of kills from them, and a lot of deaths from them.  It's smart map design.

**  The best feature in the game are special abilities for your choice of special soldiers.  It's unlocked by earning points that aren't lost when you die.  It's basically the support killstreaks from MW3, except it's always active and you don't have to sacrifice your ability to earn kill streaks to use it.  It's the smartest idea Treyarch has ever had, and it adds an extra layer to excitement as the game match progresses.  Unfortunately, some of these special weapons take less or no skill to use, which can be frustrating when you die without any chance of winning.  I don't think the special abilties were balanced well.  The more noob abilties should take more time and points to unlock, to compensate for their 'noobness'.  I feel like they never even play tested these abilities, like the mine layer abilty, or the gravity spikes.  You don't even have to aim these abilties.

I love the new jet pack.  It's fun and extremely responsive.  It controls perfectly and is always fun to use.  It's by far the best implementation of a jet pack (or jumping for that matter) ever in videogames.  A pure pleasure.

Wall running is also intuitive and fun.

the guns feel good to aim around.

The great controls add an extra layer of excitement to the game.

Sprinting causes the screen to jerk minimally, which makes you feel more like a machine.  can't decide if I like or dislike this, but it certainly sets the game apart from other call of dutys.

It all feels really polished.

Sometimes your character will not grab a ledge, causing you to fall to your death.

Shooters are all about gun porn, and Black Ops 3 has some of the best weapon renders ever.

And the gun designs are all new.  There's no M4, M16, AK47, USP, M9, UMP, MP5..... none of that.  They're all new designs.  What a pleasant surprise.  I realize that usually when these guns make an appearance in call of duty, they always get reskinned and usually get reshaped, but you can usually still tell exactly what gun they are.  Designing completely new weapons is a big risk because it severs the link between fiction and reality.  Most shooters have a lot of real world weapons to ground the game in reality.  BO3 takes a big risk to go all out.  So it's great that theyve done this.  You can still see the precursor to many weapons.  The weavil was inspired by the Rcp90, a gun which I hate.  But i like the way the weevil looks.  So it's like, they put all this effort into fixing up old guns to look not only different, but way better.  The ARK7 is a futuristic AK47, and so on.

The graphics are great.  Beautiful textures and shaders.  5/5 for visuals.  It's a massive improvement over their previous games and takes full advantage of next gen hardware.  It's got the best looking hi res assets you will ever see.
I also love the weapon reload and death animations.

I also love the player's arms and hands.  Getting this right is essential to any first person shooter, and it looks fantastic.  The best renders you have ever seen in any FPS.

I didn't realize Treyarch was capable of these visuals.  It's the kind of massive leap forward that makes you wonder who developed it.

I'm not sure how to describe black ops 3's graphics compared to their earlier games COD3, World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2.  When I say it's their best looking game ever, I mean that at the time these games came out, they were not impressive as this game is now.

It's a mind blowing leap forward for Treyarch, and it runs at 60 framers per second.

It makes me wonder if it's the best looking game ever made.  Maybe MGS5 has better face renders, but you only see those close up in cutscenes, so it's not really a fair comparison.

I can't really decide if it's the best looking game ever...  I don't feel comfortable saying it is or isn't, but it must be good to generate that kind of confusion.

Suffice to say that Black Ops 3 is as good as games can look.

I can talk about how great the graphics are all day, but it doesn't matter if the game is unplayable.  And the multiplayer is unplayable.

It's Sad that all Treyarch's hard work as gone to waste, but it's also true.

For me, the whole point of multiplayer is to test your skill against other living players.  That's what I find fun about it.  Strategy comes in a distant second.  You will find both lacking here.

There's fun to be had here in the well designed maps, but the Lag, Host advantage, Net Code and Spawn points make you suffer to get to it.

Every once in a while, you'll run into another player while you're both in no mans land, and have a sick shootout putting both your skills to the test...

And then the host comes around the corner and kills you instantly.",neutral

1221,"There's a reason this game is so cheap ( i found it for about $10-15)

It's a terrible game! Now, I almost never say that about games (most have something redeeming in it) but I am a die-hard Tetris Fan-Girl, and I found it, quite frankly, embarressing!

Just we're clear, this versian is for the GBA.

I picked it up, because I was excited to see that someone had finally made a color tetris game. When I turned it on, I noticed several things which disappointed me right off the bat.

There are several modes of play in this game, and only one which is ""Plain-vanilla"" tetris. Most of the modes are fun for a time, but only the classic tetris is even worth playing.

There are a few redeeming factors, but overall, being able to switch out your next piece (and ""Hold"" a favorite), and FINALLY being able to ""quick drop"" your piece instead of waiting as it drops, does not make up for the forgiving difficulty and distracting colors and backgrouds of theis game.

Several things prompted me to rate it so low.

One, there is no score-saving. Heck, there isn't any way to score the game at all! What fun is it when you can't even brag about your high score?

Two, the ""infinate rotate"" feature made it so you can continue to rotate a piece endlessly until you figured out where you wanted to set it.

Three, the ""shadow block"" makes it so that you can see where you your piece will drop. Makes the game too easy.

Those three items have effectively ""broken"" tetris for me! I promptly took the game back and requested a refund. Avoid this versian of tetris at all costs! If you must have a tetris fix, it's possible to find

the original for the gameboy under $10. (Even if it does stick out of your gba sp two inches!

Don't mess with the successful tetris formula!

Until a new versian comes out that addresses these issues, I'm sticking with my gb tetris!",negative

Secondly, Max looks NOTHING like he did in the original! I can understand that times change, and I read how super looking max now is, compared to the original, but His looks didn't strike me as great. Medicore, I would say. And last but not least, if you don't have high specs for this game, don't even bother wasting your money, or downloading the demo(especially if your a dial up user). It's just not worth it.

1230,"Ok so this is a complete failure in trying to get a transformers game out on the new consoles. If they would've just done a fall of cybertron remastered edition with a few more levels in campaign I would've been much happier.

Fall of cybertron was the best transformers game I had ever played and multiplayer wise it was the best experience I had with conquest, escalation, capture the flag, and my favorite of course the deathmatch. True player on player competition.

Hopefully they could redeem themselves by creating a patch and adding these modes.

They also removed the customization of your own unique bots.

Edge of reality basically hurt the high moon series badly.

That being said there are a few additions that are welcome but lack of new weapons, killing the multiplayer, and not a big jump in graphics it falls short dramatically. If I was an executive for activision I would be pushing the development team to build a patch to release to make up for this failure of a rushed product. Games can still be fixed, updated, and made better after the launch with PSN. If a patch comes out addressing these issues it could be a great game until then it's the only transformers game available on PS4.

If you loved the multiplayer of fall of cybertron you will be disappointed. If you haven't played any of the foc series and are a newbee that doesn't care about online gaming you might like this game a lot. If you are a kid under 13 you probably won't care and enjoy it as a transformers game.

1232,"8 reasons Thief is the worst game I've played so far of this new generation:

1 - VISIBILITY
the game is so dark i can barely see anything half the time. there is no in-game brightness slider - the game tells you to use YOUR OWN display to adjust brightness. what? just for this one stupid game? then adjust it back for everything else I use it for? and back-n-forth and back-n-forth constantly over-and-over again? that's incredibly inconvenient and flat out stupid. it didn't matter, the game was impossible for me to get through so I had to do it just to be able to see where I was. after adjusting the brightness and contrast, I still struggle to see anything properly and whatever beauty I'm supposed to be witnessing is now completely washed out. this game may end up being the one that has actually physically harmed me (my eyes) the most...Note: I use a projector but there is NO issue with my display as ALL other games function as they should (BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM!) We joked as I went through, ""wow, progressive values have really taken hold. I never thought I'd be able to play a game developed BY BLIND PEOPLE!!!!"" Others in the room joked, ""they should have called THIS game 'The Darkness'""

2 - CINEMATICS
at the end of the first level the game completely froze during what was obviously (based on the latter dialog of other characters) a VERY IMPORTANT cut scene. i completely missed what happened in the story as a result. Something happened to the main female character. alive? dead? missing? were there bad guys there? did they kill, abduct her? me? something happened to me...I have no idea what the hell happened - that scene is gone...stupid. at the end of the game, you beat a boss (the battle itself is a bit stupid). You go from beating the boss in the middle of a ship, to a confounding cinematic in which the boss is somehow dramatically hanging on a ledge of the ship (like at the end of Die Hard) nowhere near where they once were (did they teleport?)...as the 7-year-old in the room remarked ""why does that even matter, there's water below""). The boss acted as if they would fall to their death. Why? The fall looked like 20 feet at the most and into gentle water. Can they not swim?

3 - TONE
the main character seems to have 2 tones, sarcastic and sarcastic a-hole. actually that describes everyone's character. what motivation is supposed to propel the gamer through toward the end? why steal everything? for what? to live in the worst, most miserable city ever? It's like a medieval Detroit. The Theives Guild series of quests in Skyrim, which were somewhat generic, at least made some kind of sense...you'll stole a bunch of stuff to restore the guild to it's former glory and rose in it's ranks...but why are we here in Thief? we appear to be stealing everything not nailed down, even from poor harmless victims...for what? so now the city will even be worse? not much back story to explain the main character's motivations. I liked or sympathized with 0 characters in this game. if you nuked it from orbit, I wouldn't care, nor would you...probably nor would they....

4 - NAVIGATION
the map is utterly useless, even counter-intuitive. if you can't remember how to get back to such-n-such place (which will happen regularly as quests are assigned) and consult the map, the map may lead you into a solid wall, a complete closed off area, etc... you also continuously LOSE the smaller corner map every time you save, transition, etc. Annoying. Also annoying are the multiple button presses that it takes to get to the big map. as the map isn't very pretty or inspiring, at least they should have made it useful. the map coupled with struggling to be able to see things properly made getting from point A-to-B maddening. Navigation and mobility, which you'd think you'd want to be functioning well as you're a thief, are the biggest (unintentional) challenges in the game.

5 - DIALOG
dialog is idiotic and repetitive. all the characters bitch that they wish they had some coffee. is this world barren of coffee? robotic character animations are repetitive. if you have subtitles turned on, you'll see inaudible dialog repeated over and over and over. i turned it off. the audio is weird in many places. you'll overhear characters that are supposed to be inside (giving you clues as to where treasures are), as clear as day...

6 - RESPAWN
enemies annoyingly constantly re-spawn (similar to Farcry2). no way to get rid of them permanently. once you feel like you've stealthfully gotten past them once or twice in the proper ghostly way, you'll get bored of that...I ended up just running past most of them for the rest of the game...combat isn't particularly interesting. you can fire an arrow or 2 or hit someone with a sap. and that's it.

7 - STEALING
the game's called Thief, so hows the stealing part? pretty mundane. it's not particularly broken. but it isn't unique or interesting relative to other games. sneak past dude. crawl. sneak past some other dude. steal thing. unlock thing. steal other thing...sneak and escape. unlocking stuff is a simple affair. rotate thumb stick...based on some of the other fundamental things being completely broken (being able to see, navigation), I'm actually glad they didn't decide to do some extravagant unique auteur idea here...it probably would have completely misfired...

8 - COMPETITION
the game's natural competitors are Assassin's Creed, Dishonored, Hitman, and other similar stealth-based titles like the original Splinter Cell...Thief has NOTHING over any of these games. Not even 1 unique bullet point or thing-that-works-better or aesthetic or anything at all...Go play those games instead. I can't compare it to other games in the Thief franchise. I haven't played them. This entry does not make me want to...

COMPLETE UTTER FAILURE",negative
1233,"After reading all the great reviews, I was very much looking forward to this game.  However, after playing it around 6 to 7 hours, I am left with much disappointment.  If you want a great first person shooter for your PS3, go with Modern Warfare 2 or Resistance 2.  If you want a game that looks good but plays terrible, Killzone 2 is your game.  Overall, I really regret buying Killzone 2 and can't see how this game got all the good reviews.  I am guessing it is because it is a Playstation exclusive.

Pros:
-Graphics are pretty good (though not any more impressive than Resistance 2 or Modern Warfare 2)
-Lots of effort has been put in cinematics

Cons:
-Control feel is terrible.  The reaction of your characters movement lags, aiming is slow and imprecise.  It feels like my character is trying to walk on ice without slipping.
-Lots of 2-3 second pauses throughout the game ruin the feel of the game.
-Game feels like it is running in slow motion.  I haven't checked the frames per second but I wouldn't be surprised if the frames per second drop to under 20.
-Your guy is very short, but isn't.  During all the cutscenes, it is obvious you are as tall as anyone else, but when playing the game, you are literally two feet shorter than everyone else.
-Characters are a joke.  Main character has no personality.  Everyone else is a caricature.",positive
1234,"Unless it would go toward a bonfire.  Seriously, this game is the worst game I have every played in my life, and when I think of a bad game, this one comes to mind.  EGM actually gave it two 0.0 and a 1.5.  Sad.  But then again, I don't think that this game dosen't even deserve a rating, other than ""steaming pile of a fat 80 year old middle school dropout's [deleted by amazon]"".  Thus, this game dosen't even deseerve to exist.  Pictochat, which THQ ripped off, is better, and that's free.  But maybe you want some more explaining.  Here you go

Fun chatting through great-looking 16-bit character animations

Everyone in Pin Pals is represented by an avatar you can dress up and customize

Try to upgrade your avatar by earning cool points - collect, trade, chat and play minigames to win

Supports the single cartridge multiplayer function -- 15 people can play through a single cartridge

The avator is so ugly, it is just pointless.  And the single chat function is terrible.  Why would you even consider talking to A.I. avators.  There's also less functions in the game as well.  Less characters, smaller keyboard, and only one pencil width.  Pictochat has all this.  Who wants to buy clothes for that tiny picture anyway? I will warn you, do not buy this game.  IF you do, you are buying a product that falls in the same catergorie as kidz bop.  Simplified and kiddy mess.  kidz bop is a terrible music series, and to be honest, I don't like Pictochat.  Unless you want to draw stupid pictures, than don't bother.  Just don't get this.  YOu will regret it.  Unless your a moron and actually like this lame kiddy image, than save your money and buy Brain Age or Big Brain Academy instead. If you already have it........just save your money, period.

IF YOU BUY THIS, AND LIKE IT, YOU ARE AN IMBECILE",neutral
1235,"So, where to start. The graphics are slightly better than a PS2 game. No matter what the critics may say, the game is still very repetitive. One of the game's favorite missions is taking a bunch of your cronies and stationing them at certain spots. The combat in this game sucks as does the stealth mechanics. Fighting is slow boring and tedious. I have no idea what type of game ubisoft was trying to make. If you walk down a street be prepared to be harassed by idiots or attacked by enemies just for walking. When your in a battle with enemies they stand around and do nothing but attack and interrupt the minute you try to attack. Its like the game developers are trying to piss you off. And the platforming... My god, would it have taking that much effort to add a normal jump button. The main character is slow and uncontrollable, he'll just fly off in a random direction. Also, there are only four directions to move in. Whats the point of an analog stick? What is this, 1995? There is really nothing good about this game. I have never wanted to break a game as badly as I have Asscreed 2. Save your money or buy something good, like, you know, FFXIII.",positive
1236,"I've been an avid cod player since the original on PC. I remember when the first modern warfare came out, I was ecstatic. The innovation of the game was astounding. The sniping mission on single player blew my mind. Just a great product that you could easily tell was thoroughly polished and well thought out. The series has become an icon in the action gaming world and I feel as though the newest installment, along with black-ops have really strayed away from what made the series so great.
Pros:
- lots of fun to be had here still.
- sound is actually O.K.
- lots of perks and side games (spec ops)
Cons:
- The game feels and looks remarkably like MW2. The menus are the same, most of the weapons are recycled and the graphics are totally the same. I feel as though I've been ripped off and the company is riding on the coat tails of the earlier MW installments. The name should not be what sells this game, rather the gameplay and new additions. It seriously feels like DLC.
- Bad matchmaking. I often get the host message from MW2 that stops the game. There is a tremendous amount of lag that just decimates my will to play or to find another match.
- map design. The map design is small, cramped and filled with tight corners. It really comes down to pure luck. You die incredibly fast from the constant enemy contact. I enjoy the simulated combat but it really pushes the game towards run and gun rather than strategy or tactics. Sniper rifles should not be included since your are unable to fire more than 50 meters since the maps are so cramped. Most snipers run and quick scope. There is really too much busy-ness in the maps as well. they've totally overdone the ambient scenery.
-campaign- completely cliche, same old crap.
- community- there is always some screaming little kid in every match that relentlessly trash talks or just talks about irrelevant things or likes to sing. also the guys that play their music so loud it can be heard on my end. Fun stuff.

I give the game 3 stars for fun because, honestly its a lot of fun to mindlessly game sometimes. And COD really takes the thinking out of gaming. Im a huge fan of MW2 and agree with the ""don't fix what's not broken"" policy, but that usually only works in sports games. I would like to see updated graphics, better story for the campaign, a complete overhaul of weapons online and a more open sandbox type of multiplayer. Shame on activision for charging 60 dollars for this game and shame on me for buying it after reading the reviews. As you notice the reviews on here are about 50/50 of 5 star and 1 star, chances are you'll love the game or totally hate it. I think Ill check back in on the series in 2022 for call of duty modern warfare: 14 where the eco terrorists steal the russian nuke or chemical weapon and just go crazy on the general public. Or maybe I wont.",positive
1237,"Well I am seemingly always going through the wired controllers pretty quickly but three days?!! I usually buy the wired over the wireless due to less replacement of batteries/chargers etc. Also, cost is a huge factor with the wireless running on average around double the price. However the major flaw within all the wired controllers is a fairly quick burnout of the wires and thus making the controllers lack connective capabilities. This controller though originally caught my eye due to its more unique appearance & light up abilities unfortunately was made very cheap. The controller wires started to die out by the third day of use, only every now and again finding itself able to keep connection if you wiggle the wires just right. Think I will have to suck it up and start purchasing wireless controllers since they last much much longer.",neutral
1238,meh,negative
1239,"This game is poorly made. I love most adventure puzzle games, but not this one. I agree with the other reviewers who say this was a big disappointment. The people who developed this game have not heard of something called a mouse. The game is 1st person 3D, but you have to move with the keyboard--and not even with the arrow keys, with A, S, D and W. Trying to move through the scenes was an exercise in frustration--I was constantly running around in circles, bumping into walls, and sometimes ending up in random places as if I fell through the floor. According to a walk-through I consulted, I had made it about half-way through the game before I gave up and decided to move on to something less painful. Another thing is that the graphics demands for such a simplistic game are insane. Unless you have a fairly new computer, you will have problems with the graphics in this game. I have a 128MB video card, and while the game was playable, the graphics were constantly freaking out and the panning was unbearably sluggish. It's really too bad because I think I would have enjoyed finishing the story, but I simply cannot stand to subject myself to this poorly-constructed game.",negative
1240,"Purchased the Ultimate version of HoT directly from NCSOFT, ArenaNet on Friday and started the game. I understood it would take some time for the extra GEMS to be available not a big deal.  But what is that I am not able to use the Trader to buy items with the cash I have made while in the game. So I get the extra Character Slot, Minor Items in game, No GEMS for up to 72 hours and I have to wait 4 Days to use the trade system to do anything. This might not seem like a big deal but you are not able to buy additional bank slots, bags, or anything else even with the game cash earned while playing! This makes no sense at all. I purchased the expansion with the core game on Friday, spent $100 for it knowing full well I would not have the GEMS right away but there was no mention that I would not be able to use a core component on the game for 4 days!  I have limited time to play and knew I could get in some time this weekend but now I am at a standstill because I don't have bags, can't expand my bank slots and have to rely on drops and vendors only for items instead of going to the Trader. Please be warned. When I sent support a message questioning this I received a reply surprisingly quickly; Great; my reply for a refund gets no reply.  This should have been disclosed up front. If it had I would not have purchased this game and moved onto to something else.",positive

1248,"Activision has done it again! By that I mean they created something abominable using a license people like so they could trick them out of their hard-earned cash. This time we have a tie-in to the rather controversial Ghostbusters movie that came out in the summer. Hilariously enough, this isn't the first time Activision tried making desperate bank from the Ghostbusters license. Look no further than the Angry Video Game Nerd if you want to know about their initial scam.

Like most of Activisions licensed games, the story takes place after the movie its trying to exploit in the pursuit of money. The heroines of the movie got to be successful and stuff but the narrative focuses on a new cast of Ghostbusters. These can best be summed up as half-baked cartoon characters that have no personality beyond the one trait each person is given. It isn't even as if theres a story beyond whats established, either. The whole point of the game is going around trying to uncover ghosts lurking in areas people hire the Ghostbusters to pluck them out of. Oh, and some overarching plot about the president in trouble thanks to ghost assassins. Too bad the characters are about as appealing as cardboard boxes with air horns.

Oh deary me, the graphics......If it was some sort of Xbox Live or Playstation Network title for $5, it would look slightly tolerable. This is Activision were talking about, though, so of course this had to be a retail game at the full $50 price tag. There is simply no reason why there should be a AAA game entirely played from a top-down view on a console as late as the Playstation freaking 4! Ghostbusters looks like a mediocre Nintendo DS game blown up for the sake of high definition! It doesnt help that the visuals are always so dark and bleak. Sometimes, colors would randomly be thrown around from certain actions, but its otherwise the kind of thing that puts a person to sleep just by looking at it. What is eye-opening, however, is the fact that the games framerate would sometimes briefly stutter every now and then.

Theres nothing more annoying than when video game characters cant ever get themselves to shut up. This holds true with this game. Heres one thing that surprises me: How the crap did they convince musical legend Grant Kirkhope to compose the score for this game?! That is the one saving grace the game has to offer, but I feel bad that he felt the need to put forth more effort than the rest of the crew evidently pulled together. Its just a shame the music is bound to be overshadowed by constant sounds of laser blasts and enemy attacks.

Ghostbusters is a 3D top-down shooter. A very linear, boring, dull, painful one at that. Enemies and bosses all feel the same in every level. In fact, the levels themselves all feel the same. There is nothing to distinguish them from one another other than slightly different-looking scenery. The mechanics themselves are somewhat twin-stick-y, as you can move with the left analog stick and aim with the right. Aside from grenades that stun enemies, there is nothing you can really do to make shooting enemies fun. Theres hardly an incentive to face 85% of the enemies anyway since the only times you have to fight any are when the path is behind a locked door or gate.

I will admit that I did garner a bit of satisfaction when I smacked a ghost against the ground with my stream as I was capturing it. Yet, even that gets old since each and every level (except the first?) feels like slogging through a marathon. They typically, and I mean typically, last from about a half-hour or even longer. The amount of padding in this game is so awful that youd forgive every other game whose padding youve not been fond of.

Its not like theres anything challenging about it, either. At least one of the characters has a feature in which the player could view a line along the ground that tells exactly where to go. It effectively takes the term linear to its most literal level. Even when you do somehow screw up in the gameActually, to come to think of it, theres even flaws with what happens there! You see, this game obviously wants to cater to the multiplayer aspect. If you're not like me and don't want anybody else to suffer this travesty, however, you are stuck with AI teammates.

They at least have better combat skill than the Star Fox crew, but they are also some of the most oblivious AIs Ive ever witnessed when it comes to the player being downed. As long as another players character is beside you and presses the designated button, your health bar is fully healed, kicking away any struggles one may have from monotonous monster mashing. When enemies are still around to be killed, the AI takes that as top priority over your cries for help. They will even be right near you and still not revive you if its focused on killing something.

SighWhy do I keep doing this to myself? Somehow I keep getting surprised every time theres a game with Activisions name on it that turns out to be one of the worst things to be released in the decade. I guess Im thankful that they aren't pumping out as many atrocities as they did last year, but they obviously refuse to learn from their actions anytime soon. Three days after this game came out, Fireforge, the dev team that Activision got to make this Ghostbusters game, went bankrupt. But hey: As the years have shown us, Activision will always find a way to screw people over, whether they be development teams they hire or gullible customers that spend their cash on what they expect to be a decent video game. Until something changes, its going to be hard for non-Skylanders Activision games to receive anything more than a 1/10 from me.",neutral

This game is a throwback to yesteryear...a very old style game.  RPG?  Maybe back then.

There is no voice dialogue.  Characters' mouths move, but there are no words. Instead, there is written text on screen that you get to read, and then click on your text response.

The graphics are dated, and remind me of a kids game...very colorful.

You cannot change any of the key bindings...and there are lots of them. To see the key bindings, hover over objects in the game, or consult the game manual.

Space and planet graphics are very 2 dimensional.

The music and sounds are dated.

I've uploaded a video of the game, so you can see for yourself BEFORE buying it.

Some people may like this game, but it is definitely not for me. I stopped playing after a few minutes.

1254,"I don't expect much when it comes to video games based on movies.  Quite often they feature mediocre gameplay, a boring storyline that sort of, but doesn't really follow the plot of the film, and pointless objectives that make you feel the developers were banking on the franchise itself to sell copies of the game and didn't care about making it something actually worth playing.  But The Golden Compass is bad, really bad, even for a movie based game.

I gave the game a chance--I played through the whole thing--but I just couldn't get over how poorly made it was.  For starters, the gameplay is dull and the difficulty varies far too much for a game intended for younger children.  At times you're pushing the button flashing up on the screen (which is fine), and at other times you're trying to keep Iorik alive while he's fighting the witch queen or a guy with a flamethrower.  This game is rated for kids 10+, but I imagine a child that age would be bored stiff with the button matching mini-games and frustrated beyond belief with the more difficult parts of the game.

The controls are fairly straightforward but the camera angle is absolutely awful.  In fact I spent as much time trying to overcome the terrible angle, when I couldn't see what I was fighting or the ledge to which I was supposed to be jumping, as I did trying doing anything else.  If the camera worked right the game would still be dull and rather pointless, but the camera angle makes this game nearly unplayable.

Part of the potential appeal for this game comes from the prospect of playing as Iorik, the polar bear who accompanies the girl Lyra on her adventures.  Playing Iorik is the best part of the game, but unfortunately the majority of the game is spent playing as Lyra, thus stifling what could, possibly, have been the game's only redeeming quality.

There are many, many better games available for the price.  Don't be fooled into buying it just because it accompanies the movie--this title is bound to bring frustration and annoyance to anyone who plays it.  And even if, somehow, someone were to enjoy the game, the entire storyline is good for about 5 hours of play--definitely not worth it.",neutral
1255,"I had looked at this game for some time and here are the facts.
this game is Very Similar to an old ps2 title called Pirates: The legend of Black Kat and Black Kat is by far a superior title. (Pirates: The legend Of Black Kat also has 2 player Ship Fighting!.) they both have fighting AND platforming elements plus it seems you fight the same recycled enemies over and over the only new critter I saw was a boss that Requires you to transform into the Black Buccaneer. I have to say for a transformation type of game they did not bother to have your character ""power up"" when the transformation is done. seems to be more a visual pleaser then anything involved with gameplay. the environments are very very bland and have few textures. the lighting and particle effects are low end and lame at best. what could have been a solid pirate game is now nothing more then a low budget platformer dressed up as a pirate *perhaps stealing your money?* truly a letdown in the pirate catagory.

Sound: Not good reminds me of atari 2600 1 star

Graphics: ugh... really Low end and Choppy bad collision detection too 1 star

Overall: not even worth a rental. with horrid gameplay, targeting, and terrible platforming elements, I suggest Black Kat or even Pirates of the carribean over this title. this one is not even for Rabid Pirate Fans.

That is why I refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times I can install the game, let alone a DRM program (like SecuRom) that could be considered a trojen horse.

As a side note, this DRM method does nothing to stop piracy. All of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some, like spore, even before their release (with the exceptions of Sacred 2 and Red Alert 3 which have not been released yet, however the developers confirmed that they would use the SecuRom activation DRM scheme).

1266,"I enjoyed playing Battlefield 3, it is a much different type of combat shooter than the ""run and gun"" of Call of Duty gameplay. Battlefield 4 is a huge disappointment. Not only are the multiplayer maps smaller, the gameplay is more like COD; run around as fast as you can and shoot any enemies you run into. Even worse, this game is riddled with numerous technical problems that make the game virtually unplayable at times.
There are too many problems to list here and likely even more that I haven't encountered yet but here's a few:
The game freezes constantly, especially in Multiplayer mode; all progress and XP is lost and the Xbox console has to be rebooted. This is really frustrating and takes a lot of fun out of the multiplayer game. The loadout menus are hard to navigate and apparently you can only change weapons while you are in a game. Using the server browser can often be a ""road to nowhere""; plenty of empty servers but you can't get into any of them. Getting into an online game is where the game seems to freeze the most. If you have a bunch of friends playing, you can't join as a squad. The launch weekend double XP wasn't working either; Dice's way of thanking customers who pre-ordered or bought the game on the release date.
There are significant issues with the gameplay as well. Players are hard to see at times, often you don't see who killed you until after you're dead. There are major issues with the netcode(the computer code used for online gameplay); you can be killed before an enemy even fires a shot, you empty a clip into him and are killed before he even fires his weapon. As far as weapons go, you can empty an assault rifle clip into an enemy a couple hundred yards away with no effect and he winds up shooting you with a couple shots from a pistol. This makes for a lot of snipers; since you can kill an enemy at the same distance with a sniper rifle or pistol, why not? Camperland; if you stop running, you usually are killed by one of the many snipers. Hard to tell how many hits it takes to kill somebody; I snuck up on a sniper, emptied a full clip from a SCAR-L assault rifle into his head from six inches away, he got up and killed me with a pistol.
OK, it's a new game, there's bound to be some glitches, right? Battlefield 4 does not have glitches, it has major problems; a game that crashes your system and does not work should have never been released. Dice will fix it with a client side patch, right? Don't hold your breath. With Xbox One coming out in a few weeks, most likely the Battlefield 4 for that console has big problems as well and Dice has every available employee working on that so the Xbox One version doesn't crash and burn like this Xbox 360 version did, Xbox 360 gamers are probably going to be in for a long wait until the problems with this game are fixed.
When you pre-order a game on Amazon, it can take a week to get it with standard shipping, never mind the free shipping. You might miss the bonus XP weekend they usually throw on a game's release. This game's double XP weekend was a big fail so I guess it didn't matter in this case. It was also supposed to come with an ""exclusive Amazon pre-order battlepack"" which I have not received. Thankfully, I was able to cancel the COD Ghosts Hardened Edition I pre-ordered from Amazon, I'll never pre-order another video game from them again, just not worth it.
Battlefield 4 is pretty much a loser all the way around. These game developers don't seem to have much respect for their customers, it's getting harder to keep shelling out $60 a game. I'm sure glad I did not pre-order the Xbox One.",negative

1273,"There are WAY too many credible stories about these things causing problems to risk a $400 360. Putting *any* kind of power-drawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble -- I own a lot of expensive electronics and I'd never do it in a million years.

Instead of taking such a chance, go to your local retailer and buy a little fan (4""-6"") designed for placing/clipping (depending on how you've got your Xbox set up) on your desk at work, etc. You can get one for $5-$10 and don't have to worry about leeching power from your 360. Just set it up beside the 360 so that air flows beneath and over top.

Since your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill, you can shop for one that's quiet and fits your setup. My 360 actually runs quite cool, although I do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifier.

ps Always, always, always put electronics that generate heat in as open a location as possible. NEVER put anything on top, ALWAYS place on a hard surface, and ALWAYS leave at least a few inches clearance all around. Lastly, ALWAYS use a surge suppressor.",negative

Bad.
No jump button.
Linear game play (You use a button to access doors and stairs, what is this 1985?)
Clunky controls. Its like driving an RC car where you have to mentally reverse your thinking when the car is coming toward you versus going away. This is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayable.

1275,"I have written and rewritten this review, and this is my final offer. Any would-be buyers of this game, PLEASE take this as a caveat; I really want to convey just how lousy this game is. Any comparison of this game to the rest of the series is ludicrous, but anyway...
As I said before, you play the game as the character Ryu, a government grunt. Mankind has been forced to live under the earth due to reasons lost in antiquity, and the citizens are placed into their positions via a rating system (a ratio - the closer the ratio is to 1, the more potential a person has, and thus the greater station this person is allowed to have). Surprisingly, the higher your ratio, the closer to the surface you are allowed to live, despite the conviction that the outside world is poisonous. Anyway, the purpose of the game is to climb out from the bowels of the earth in an attempt to reach the sky. This is the story. If you find it excellent, well, to each his own, but personally,I don't think this tale stands up to the likes of Xenosaga, .hack:infection, Suikoden III, FFX, etc.
However, complicating matters is the D-Hunger gauge, against which I have railed in the past. As you progress through the game, this gauge constantly rises (increasing about 1/100 of a percent every 2-3 seconds on its own). SHould your character transform into a dragon (or use other special abilities), the rate of increase rises dramatically. Assuming you never use ANY of these abilities, however, you essentially have 20000-30000 seconds to finish your game (or about 6-8 hours). Failing at this, it is game over. In fact, you have to restart your game from the beginning. There is NO carrying over of statistics; what CAN be carried over are the weapons and armor you have equipped, any items you have stored away, the skills you have learned and ""party experience"", which can be used to boost your characters upon the replay. Furthermore, if you are considering beating the game on your first go around, don't. It is physically impossible (I know, I tried it out). I have a lot of words to describe this atrocious system, but ""realistic"" isn't the first to come to mind.
I believe in innovation, when it makes a game more fun. However, this is absurd. You want the trick to beat the game? Simply play through as far as you go twice, remembering to store all of your acquired items and NEVER use party experience. That way, on your third time through, you can buff up your characters so much that they will destroy any enemy they come across (yes, I decided to go back and finish the game). Hence, an 8 hour game becomes a 24 hour game, since every scene is seen three times. The fact that you can't save often is a blessing in disguise - saving doesn't really help you anyway (the D-Hunger gauge isn't going anywhere). Oh, and for a more ""realistic"" gaming experience, notice that you have a ""quit"" command. This command essentially allows you to save at a certain spot, and then use you dragon abilities to try to acquire certain skills and items you might not otherwise be able to acquire. Oh sure, you'll die, but you can start over at the save spot, with all of the abililities now in your repertoire. In fact, the guide (which may be the most useless instruction guide in all of gaming, oftem times confusing me more than instructing me) tells you to use this strategically. The realism is overwhelming. The moral is: if you try to beat the game on one walkthrough, forget it! Instead, the system rewards ineptitude over ingenuity.
If you are one of those (sad to say many) people who simply cannot stand the mainstream, and would sooner gouge out their eyes than play a game everyone else is playing, this might be for you. To be sure, the system is innovative, and I am sure it will never rear its ugly head again. However, if you enjoy fun game, or if you simply don't want to waste fifty bucks on a stinker, stay the hell away from this abomination. Play Xenosaga (another innovative game), or .hack, or even Final Fantasy X for the nth time. This game reeks...",neutral
1276,"This ""thing"" refused to work!  Even when I held one of the two included battery packs up against the pins of the charger base, I could only get it to light up for a few seconds before it went black again.  Forget about getting this to work with the actual XB1 controller laying on top of it!

Putting the actual XB1 controller onto this unit with the custom battery cover in place didn't work at all.  The pins on the charger base are obviously not making contact with the pins on the battery pack, so you end up with a totally disfunctional product!

I returned mine for a refund.  I've had good luck with other Nyko products in the past, but this product is a joke!  So poorly designed that it simply can't perform the function of charging your XB1 controller without removing the batteries.

After I returned this, I bought a four pack of rechargeable AA batteries and am simply using those in the Xb1 controller.  Its a little more of a hassle having to remove the batteries from the controller to charge them, but I keep the second pair of batteries charged and ready, so when the set in the controller gets low, I just pop in the other set and continue gaming.",negative
1277,"Just a note to gamers out there. Don't buy Star Wars Battlefront. Beta was good, but I found out that if you don't have playstation plus it's basically a crap game. How I know this, I just played the actual copy of the game, there is barely anything to do in single player. No story mode, just training, survive, and something they put in called battle (which has several levels but only really works for multiplayer. Doing it by myself I was bored). So, that's all there is for single player. Nothing else. They stuck everything that could possibly be good about this game in multiplayer.
So, guess what, you pay a huge amount for the game, and then you have to keep paying to actually play anything. Don't buy it, it's worthless as is.
I seriously can't believe the new game creators could make a game this bad.

Final note: I have always, when I rate games on amazon rated games really well or 5 stars. I've never given a one star review, just to let you know. So, do not waste your money on this. I have a bookcase full of games, this is the worst battlefront game ever. Five stars on graphics, 1 star on single player gameplay. I'm not paying to play a game I just paid a huge amount for, it's nowhere near worth it. I bought Assassin's Creed, that was worth it. So, please go buy something like Fallout 4 or Assassin's Creed, you'll get more fun and awesomeness. All they pretty much allow you to do with Battlefront is run around on multiplayer, you get nothing to do on single player basically. I can't believe I was jacked after the beta test now. I hope the producers for this game lose a huge amount of money. They owe the fans big time for this game. I suggest they throw in free DLC's for single and multiplayer to compensate for their extreme lack of content.

On that note also, for content, could they please make the main screen look a little more ornate. It looks exactly the same as beta. I liked beta, but the point of beta is to expect more and be cut off from a lot, not find out it's the same in a lot of areas. I'm glad they improved in some areas, but this game is an ultimate fail. I've never played a game this bad. EVER.

Edit: I've now had this game for a long while ago and it's literally taken up until July to come out with some offline content for the game that looks worthwhile, as it's Walker Assault and, I can't remember the other mission but it's where you fight with X-Wings and Tie-Fighters in just a ship to ship battle.

Now the fun part, I tried both of these to test out how great it would be. Honestly I'm not too impressed. I remember playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 and you'd play battle levels like these, and it felt more realistic, and you had a certain feeling as you played, a drive to move forward, to keep going. It's funny that EA who makes the game when they released these two offline modes I believe said we've added story levels.

""Oh really? Sto-ry le-vel-s. Is that what you call these?""

All in all this has been the worst game I've seen from EA, and even with all the months EA has had to add content to help the game get better they've added very little to impress. It's utterly pathetic, having one of the best game industries in the world create something of the lowest class of game, with just good graphics to make it look good and an immediate exciting air to attract people. It's got a knack for advertising I'll give it that, but it's not a game worth buying, and don't buy the season pass, it's really not worth it.

I would say buy another game but sadly for the moment I'm in the same boat others are and there's not a ton of good shooters right now, we have to wait. Come on Game industries, you've got all these people with ideas, come up with something great, I know you can do it.",neutral

You: these should not break like that
You: I spend thousands on sony products
You: this is the only product that was made this poorly
Enrico: Thanks for the feedback, I'll be escalating this situation to the proper department and investigate the quality of the product. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
You: Yes you can replace my headset under its 1 year warranty
You: where the product is supposed to be free of defects
You: if it broke under normal non abusive use
You: IT IS not FREE OF DEFECTS!
Enrico: As I mentioned before, this product doesn't qualify for service
You: Why does this product not qualify for service ?
Enrico: I explained that before: In this case the damage was caused by use
You: Dude
You: They broke on my head
You: while i was wearing them for the 3rd time
You: they were brand new!!!!!!!!!!!
You: thats not just wear and tear caused by use
You: If you cant replace them. Please put me intouch with your manager

You get to play as your favorite Marvel character.

Cons:
Filled with bugs from the jump. I had to replay the first mission several times just to get the boss to spawn. Bugs that should have been fixed with ease have yet to be and it's very disappointing.

The vehicle controls are absolute garbage, Makes what should be an enjoyable experience a nightmare. The combat system is also a disappointment, It's very shallow.

Repetitive and boring missions such as placing a piece of furniture 100 times. Makes the game very tedious and proves how little effort they actually put into it. If you want any real campaign, You'll have to shell out another 35 dollars for one of the play sets. Even then it's not much value to it.

Aside from exploring the painfully small world, There is nothing to do. Even playing with a friend doesn't help. Unless you plan on spending hours upon hours creating a whole world by yourself, You are gonna get sick of it real quick.

Overall:
Disney Infinity is nothing but a pathetic cash grab at an attempt to match the hundreds of millions Skylanders is raking in. After spending 70 dollars on both the set and another character, I feel incredibly ripped off. It's such a shallow and empty experience, It's pretty much a giant middle finger to the people who bought it thinking it'd be fun.",neutral

$100 for 32 GB is grossly overpriced.  I can understand why Sony does it....the hardware itself is sold at a loss, and they need to make that money back any way they can....but the prices for memory are currently an obscenity.  As a gamer, I can remember Sony fanboys screeching about how overpriced proprietary drives are for the Xbox 360.  I must wonder what those same fanboys are saying now.

I can get a 32 GB Micro SD card for around $30-35.  Sony is charging THREE TIMES AS MUCH for that same amount of storage.  This is simply not acceptable.  I plan on using and playing my Vita for as long as possible without buying any more storage until pricing is more reasonable....as in, say, $10 for 4 GB, $20 for 8 GB, and $49.99 for 32 GB.

You start off in the middle of town and must work your way through an obstacle course of killer bees and random objects thrown in your way.  Add to that you must collect clocks to keep the picture of your family from fading out.  Now that is clever I will give them that.  But bees?  Once you reach the end of the stage you will face off against different finally challenges.  From Biff and the gang to flying hearts from your mom.

Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in ""some"" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.
UBI Soft's tech support has said that this ""feature"" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  ""Flawed"" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.

I'm an off and on gamer. Sometimes I game hard every night, other times I just use my keyboard for Google and youtube searches etc with the occasional email. I am currently the latter, and my keyboard didn't even last 6 months before it began to duplicate keystrokes at random.

The worst part is, I was aware of the issue when I bought the keyboard, but thought surely those reviewers are wrong. Stupid me, here I am with the same issue in a short time.

Couldn't recommend this keyboard to anyone. Total junk. Not worth getting warranty service on... best solution would be another keyboard for the next 6 months until it decides to also crap out rinse and repeat. Mechanical keyboards are supposed to be about primarily longevity and this keyboard doesn't even last as long as the cheapest crappiest keyboard I've ever owned.",negative
1311,"I've played every single battlefield since 1942 and just honestly feel let down by this release even after sinking over 200 hours (and after sinking 1000 hours into battlefield 3) into it. I was so excited for this game, that i picked up the 360 version when it came out because i didn't have a PS4 yet and i just wanted to experience the game. I played it and thinking to myself ""Really? this is battlefield?"" thought, well, maybe it'll be better on the next gen consoles. Nope.

Remember how most other battlefield games made you fight tooth and nail to unlock the best weapons and attachments? Well now everyone starts with most of em and the others take all of two hours to unlock.

Remember when battlefield was all about effective teamwork and cooperation? Now, it's 64 people who rarely work as squads, running and gunning and camping in corners with weapons that kill in two or three bullets. I enjoyed battlefield for the strategic game play. I played cod for the fast paced arcade feel. Dice tried to imitate the twitch shooter style of Cod and failed miserably. Oh and remember Squad specs that you could use to help out your buddies. They're gone too and replaced with a system that only benefits you, which just adds to the lone wolf style of play.

Remember when having armor or aircraft on your side gave your team an advantage over infantry? That's gone too. Now 2/3rds of all players are engineers with one of the ten new rocket types that will rip your tank apart and cause your jet to start spinning right into the ground.
Remember when the entire environment was your sandbox to destroy? Now, very few buildings even have destructible walls and you will get caught on odd pieces of landscape every single time you try to vault over something. Instead of bringing every building down until the map is almost flat from the constant explosions as seen in previous games, we have lagolution whereby most maps are changed in some massive but largely useless manner that is aesthetically pleasing but really does not change much in terms of gameplay.
Remember fluid gameplay? Lag. Lag everywhere. Today a guy shot me out of his ass. Don't wanna know how. He was facing the other direction and rounds just started spraying from his pooper. Gotta love it.

Remember partying up with friends to play? That's gone.

Remember being able to change your classes outside of actually being in a game and being able to quickly change to a new gun for your class. Well, now you have to wait for a little personal island to load for you just so you can adjust your classes. Might as well join a game. Oh and wanna try to navigate the menus? Too bad. It's menu after menu after menu.

Like your controls in battlefield 3. Too bad.

Remember when one or two organized squads could effectively change the fate of a game. Well say hello to zulu squad with one man in it and two to three people in most others. Even if you have four buddies and you guys are all working together, it won't make much difference. Prepare to be mobbed by ten people wielding weapons that can kill you with a stray round to the chest or three to the foot.

Remember how awesome sniping used to be? Well say hello to morons trying to quick scope and every single class running around with DMRs. Oh and remember how carbines gave the engineers a crutch to stand on to make up for their lack of specialized anti infantry weapons, well now you get PDWs and everyone gets the carbines! But don't worry, people only use two of them anyways and you start with arguably the best one! Dont even get me started on the useless repair tool. Wanna try to get your buddy in the tank back up to full health. Too bad. It'll take you about five minutes to completely heal something and he's been hit by four rockets by now and you've died in the explosion.
Remember having helpful teammates that would destroy any anti-tank mines they spotted (very few people spot anymore either) so that a teammate wouldn't run over them? Better look out now, because the ground is covered in mines and your team will mostly just ignore them unless they feel especially generous for some odd reason.

I've tried to play the game for what it is but it just isn't battlefield to me. At this point, i'm going to get my last few map packs since i bought premium and then when I've played through those, i'll move onto something else. Hopefully Dice won't fail us with Battlefront. But due to this game, there is no way i'm buying the game right out the door. I'll wait and see what people think. Used to be a die-hard fan for dice who bought every product. Now, just really disappointed.
The only reason i'm not giving this game a 1,is because i like to believe Dice can do better. I like to think EA is to blame for most of the problems, but then i look at the game-play itself, and wonder, what was Dice thinking?  The only redeeming aspect going for them is that Dice is actively (if not slowly) trying to fix the problems in this never-ending beta, so at least they have that going for them.

Edit 1/9/15: Problems still exist. Game still sucks. It's just not a true battlefield in any way. Way to sell out Dice.",neutral
1312,"I loved Killzone on the PS2 and was excited to get a Killzone game for the PSP. Sadly, I find the difficulty level in this game to be too high.

1315,"I cannot believe how horribibly atrocious this arcade stick was. I say was, because I put the p.o.s. out of it's misery for good, instead of returning it for a refund. Upon destroying that hunk of junk, I plugged in  my regular ps2 controller and dominated opponents that had only moments before put me to shame. The joystick was so chintzy in it's design it would only pull off the command half the time. I must mention that it was nothing like an actual arcade stick, which is fluid and accurate. Imagine trying to draw a smooth circle in an octagonal plastic stencil, and that's how the stick felt. The buttons worked fine, but also felt cheap. I honestly don't know what they were thinking here. The only reason I bought the thing was for the accurate stick movement that a normal controller lacks, but shocked was I as to how much worse this handled than my normal ps2 controller. Had I returned it, it would simply be re-sold to some other poor shmuck, I could not allow that to happen in good conscience.",negative

compared to SmackDown. Look I have been a wrestling fan for about 20 years now and

This game really disappointed me. The reason I gave any stars is because of the roster of

Wrestlers it has. My advice save the $$ for SmackDown vs Raw by THQ the real authority

1318,"First off, this review is based on my experiences with many RTS games, my favorites being Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes, Warcraft III, Company of Heros, Command and Conquer (many of the titles), and many more. I'd like to start by saying that I put strong emphasis on STRATEGY and how well you are able to employ real life battlefield tactics. Also, I don't do single player a lot, but I do like it in this game, it is pretty good but this review is multiplayer only. With that said, I will start serving the meat and potatoes.

This is my first time ever playing a Starcraft game, so I was a bit nervous initially, dispute being an impatient and fast learner I was blown away at how well the tutorial was crafted. It was simple enough for a 10 year old, but it touched on key points and forced you to focus oh the lesson at hand. I felt like I was in school again, except with race horse blinders on this time. It was quick and to the point at the same time. After I completed it, I was confident in my Knowledge and decided to jump online to hone in my skills. Once online they had this kinda pre-ranked pool of players that all elected to practice against real people until they were ready for rated play. This helped me to test my skills even further. There wasn't much rushing, as there were too many choke points for it to be viable, but you got it occasionally. This pre-ranked pool helped me to hone my skills but ultimately set me up for failure in ranked.

When you fire move into ranked, you have to play 5 games to decide where you should be placed among the other ranked players. These games were not too difficult and I ended up winning 3 of my 5. FINALLY! Some ranked play!! Before you read the rest of this review, I'd like to say that I have over 60 matches played, each taking from 15min to an hour. After my first few games I noticed a trend, no choke points = get rushed punk! This became quickly annoying, so I eventually got to the point where I learned to rush as effectively or at least to properly defend while I tech. Out of about 15 games I had only won about 5, but I was learning fast. Around game 25 my games were getting better, I'd perfected about two strategies but as games went on I noticed that my weakness was not being more versatile. THIS IS WHERE THINGS GOT GOOD, and by good, I mean drop dead hilarious. As I tried many different strategies I noticed something... all of them had an equal chance of being countered, kudos on the balance, this was a plus, as nothing was the best, but some were less expected.

Your success depended on what your opponent was doing while you were putting your plan into action. Scouting seems like a big part of the game, but not much for finding out what to do in response to or opponent, but instead as a way to find other bases (if any) that your opponent set up. With that said, If I build a bunch of planes that could only attack ground in order to support my land units that could attack ground and air, If in fact my opponent had the perfect counter, It would probably be too late to do something about it once I found out.

This brings me my next point. There aren't really any tactics that you can use in this game, all of the units can span any map in seconds, ALL maps are as open as McDonald's @ 2:30 once all the drunk people realize how hungry they are, and aside from other mining spots, there really isn't much in the map. It felt like I was fighting in some wide open crater left by a sad and very symmetric meteor.

All in All, compared to many of my other favorite RTS games, this game feels like the inbreed child of rock, paper, scissors, and tic-tac-toe. You mass units, meet somewhere for a battle, and if the units you decided to mass are better than mine, well good game, and vice versa. ""YOU PICKED ROCK AND I PICKED PAPER, GG!"" That's the online experience in a nutshell, with as many tactics to employ as you can get out of Xs and Os on a 9 square field. I won't butter up this review just because everyone else does, or because it may have fans dedicated enough to try and find me. I believe that everyone deserves to know that after waiting 12 years, and paying 60 bucks, you are more than likely buying Starcraft I with better graphics, and new units (most of which you can't even use online). I don't believe this game took 12 years to make, I believe they made all 3, and want to release them at different times, so that you pay 120 bucks for a game that isn't even worth 50. Happy gaming, I'm going back to an RTS that you need a brain for.",positive

That includes the non-skippable ingame video cut ins, which you'll get sick of seeing if you have one diffcult spot.  The game took about 4 days to complete all three stories.  The maps are uninteresting.  Even the units seemed all similar.

Let me put it this way, my buddy sold me his copy for $5 after playing for a week.

As for the DRM, its already been hacked so not really worth the trouble EA.",negative
1323,"This isn't some PC snob rant. I own a PS3, 360 and PC and love all three. I debated getting this on the PS3 because I played and earned a platinum trophy on Darksiders 1, but as I built a new PC recently, I wanted to give the PC version a try. I regret that decision.

The PC port is (surprise!) shockingly bad. Video options are limited to resolution and vsync on/off (no joke). And you have to actually start a game and get through the initial story before you finally take control of the main character, Death. Only then can you pause the game and actually configure settings for the first time, and even then the game requires a restart just to change resolution and Vysnc on/off. Unacceptable. Side note: it took 3 restarts before my options finally took and the game finally rendered at my desired resolution.

Enabling VSYNC in-game is currently broken. I found this out when my within two minutes of playing my GTX570's fan spun up like a get engine. I alt-tabbed to windows and saw its fan maxed out at 85% (this particular card only goes up to 85% for some reason) with temps in the mid 90c range! I've seen this happen before with other games (Dead Island for example) so I knew the problem was broken VSYNC. Now, the game looks great, but not THAT great so as to put a GTX570 into the 90c temperature range within 2 minutes of playing the game. I also noticed a lot of screen tearing, another telltale sign of disengaged VSYNC. I also tried two other lower resolutions and all 3 settings were over-stressing my GPU.

There are indications everywhere that the minimum effort was given to this console port. The in-game inventory menu is stuck at console resolutions (1280 x 720) so if you're running any higher than that (I game at 1080p) everything is upscaled, pixelated and unsightly. During the game's many QTE sequences, or when you pick up loot dropped in the game, the on screen button prompts are also locked at console resolution, so they too look pixelated and upscaled.

The MINIMUM effort was given for this port. I wish I could get a refund for the PC version and pick up the PS3 version instead, at least then I'd be working on my trophies.

On the positive side, the game seems really fun so far. It plays great with the PC 360 controller and has a very pretty art design and graphics. Unfortunately I now have to go out of my way and look for workarounds for the quality issues that the developer should have done.

Short version: PC port is utter crap. Get it on the console of your choice. If you must get it on PC, WAIT AWHILE.

Hey game developers: Really insulting console ports are why your games get pirated. Take note. Publisher THQ is on the precipice of not existing. Why they let the developers of this game, a game THQ is relying on for huge sales, release such a terrible PC version is mind-boggling. Then again, it's now clear why THQ is in the position they are.",neutral

1329,"I remember playing the original Starcraft back in the days when my computer could barely keep up with the system requirements. This was one of those early games that actually made multiplayer worth playing over and over again. It was very addictive and I continued to play it on and off until Starcraft 2 came out. Just to let you understand how valuable Starcraft 2 is, I was a late beta tester, a few months before release, now fast forward four years later, I am still playing it almost on a daily basis! Obviously my computer can now support this game at maximum settings with fast FPS. Over the years, I have seen Blizzard fine tune this game like no other games out there, ever getting so close to complete perfection. That's no surprise, this game has the highest standards out there, people are playing it professionally as a career and even casting the game professionally as a career. Although the game does have story-mode, Battle.net is the REAL focus of this game. All the units are carefully selected, tuned, and balanced by Blizzard. The units are all useful when making strategically decisions. I have seen Blizzard adding and removing units and abilities many times. All units have special characteristics that the players should master. This game is not about building up or earning something, you get good at this game from developing your own ability to play it. Players compete by their ability to control the game, make clever decisions, and outsmart each other. The graphics and animations are top-notice even for today's standards. Not only are the animations and visuals pleasing to look at, but they are artistically thought out with many attentions to small details. The artistic appeal will make SC2's visuals outlast all games that will come after it. Watch a flock of winged-zergling running across the map, or a fleet of carriers and tempest and you'll feel that swarm of bugs, or the endgame army. Honestly, I think the story-mode is a very small part SC2, but there is something for everyone. If you don't like to compete, you can play coop by vs. computer with other players or play custom maps. The gameplay is what keeps this game going so long. Every match I ever played feels different from the next. If you don't own this game, you can watch the casting videos, and there are thousands on Youtube, granted, you'll be more entertain if you play competitively, but it's always fun to watch the pros, and use their strategy against your next opponent. Obviously, I highly recommend this game + the expansions. It's a very VERY small price to pay for so many years of entertainment.

EDIT: Why the 1-star? The game forces me to use the Battle.net launcher now. I need to launch from a shortcut for compatibility issues and this cannot happen.",positive
1330,"Ok so with over 300 hrs logged in on a monk and DH, and a full month played I can safely and without a second thought, tell anyone who's thinking of buying this game?: DONT.
Diablo 3 is essentially Blizzard's Real Money Auction House (RMAH) with a hack/slash/loot game built around it. Now, you may be telling yourself 'well I don't plan on using it, so no problem' ok that's fine. In fact, the game itself is fine for the 1st 3 levels of difficulty. Normal, Nightmare and Hell version of D3 work basically as intended: you fight, you level up, you loot. Everything is great, you feel powerful when you kill Diablo in Hell and now it's time for endgame: Inferno. 2 problems here.
#1- The first 3 difficulties don't include the ONE factor that all but leave your characters 'broken' until you TOTALLY re-gear them (or quit in the frustration, more on that later), and this is: Resistances. There are many different types in the game, none of them you'll really feel until Inferno, where you WILL be greeted with one-shots. Many of them. Dozens of them.
Now since the new patch that has GREATLY increased repair costs, you'll quickly find you have two options in inferno:
1- Go back to Hell and farm until nauseous (which no one wants to do naturally)for appropriate gear, by aquiring 5 buff stacks for finding loot and then trying to find something in the ridiculously low drop rate of Hell... or
(and how convenient)
#2 go to the RMAH. The RMAH is where all the farmers in the game go to sell their items for outrageously high gold prices or for an equivalent cash value in USD. I'm not a complete idiot so Im not paying real cash for a fake sword or staff or whatever, so the route those who are still around on the server take is to simply do farming runs for cash and hope something drops in the process.
This process can take days to find a decent piece of Inferno quality gear, farming for hours. 3 weeks in, my guys are still stuck in Act 1(inferno).
There are many rumors about Blizz intentionally lowering the drop rate on level 61+ (Inferno level) gear, putting many into a 'pay or quit' scenario as the loot needed to progress simply isn't as available as it was in the 3 easier levels.
There are also rumors of Blizz reps padding the AH with items only they can generate to sweeten the RMAH.

Im glad I waited before writing this because before you hit Inferno, the game is fun. Well, fun enough to make you want a bit more and would have recieved 5s all around, but the frustration you'll face with the lack of resistances going into inferno, the one shots, the ever-looming repair bill over your head, the almost non-existence of upgradable loot at end game - and if Im not getting loot, why the hell am I playing this game- and the blatant RMAH always in your face, the honeymoon with this game ends real fast. A shame, it seems the last of the great AAA title makers has decided to put profit before their consumers once again.

1332,"I generally love the EA PGA Tour games, but this one is a real standout for all the wrong reasons. I can't play more than 3 holes without having a game-ending crash or freeze.

- In an hour of playing, I had to reboot 4 times because the game would freeze and not allow me to hit a shot. It always occurred when I was about to take a shot, and when I'd try to hit, the sticks and buttons no longer worked.  The guide button was all that remained functional.
- I've also had several freezes (similar to above) when zooming to the ball landing area. Again, all buttons stop working.
- Very limited number of courses. Clearly they put a lot of effort into Chambers Bay, but they kind of missed the timing on that.
- No combination of swing styles, even if you use the 'customized' setup. I like the stick for swings, and 3-click for putting. Not possible.

1333,"Before I start this review I want to say a few things. I am a LONG time gamer, I have lots of love for all genres especially JRPGs and I am fairly lenient on games. I try to find enjoyment in games that are simply un-enjoyable or have many issues. However I am sorry to say that Fable: The Lost Chapter brings a new definition to the term ""Garbage."" It is simply the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Now I will tell you why:

Story - It blows. It is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable. It is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil. Nothing more, and nothing less. I'm fine with that, but the way the story presents itself is dreadful.

Voice Acting - Atrocious Crap. A 5 year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this. It is unbelievable in every sense of the word. The characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoying.

Music - Nothing memorable at all. I know you don't have Nobuo Uem, or Tsuyoshi Sekito but damn not one good track at all?

Gameplay - It's bad. You will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell. The good/bad system in the game is flawed beyond belief. I know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game FORCES you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible. The entire system is unnecessary if you can't choose.

Technical Issues - Loads of them. There is pop-in, screen tearing, freezing, and many other various glitches in the game. My favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well (The Last Remnant) but at least it had good VA, Story, Gameplay, and AMAZING music.

I know this is coming off as a HUGE rant and I don't mean to offend any of the Fable fans. However I was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them. I am just ashamed that I spent 12 dollars on this and I bought the 2nd one as well which I am just horrified to open.

I'm sorry Peter M, but if your other games are as bad as this one I will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game. If you like WRPGs I would recommend that you borrow this from a friend or rent it first so you don't take a leap of faith like I did.

So, yeah, I really wish that the ARMY or Airforce or something would come out with a full blown Wii Balance board boot camp/game area or something a little bit better than this. I'm sure that the Biggest Looser people could get better graphics that actually really do keep in time with your actual movements. The Wii Fit Balance is a lot better.

1347,"This game is a total flop. It has decent graphics which look very similar to the tv show; it feels like you are in the cartoon. There is a variety of gameplay implemented (though poorly done). Some levels you'll fly like a helicopter, others you swing around like spiderman, by jumping from one building to the next. In other levels you are inside a video game and the enviroment looks like virtual reality. And there is also a level where you are robot in the microscopic world. Sounds like fun huh? But it lacks the good humor from the tv show. It's very frustrating because there is no mini-map or directional arrows, then you end up getting lost in the level! This makes it too hard for the younger gamers and too boring for older gamers.
I suggest that you get other kids game like ""Crash Bandicoot"" or
""I-Ninja""
Pros:
+looks like the tv show
+sounds like the tv show
+variety in level play
+good controls
Cons:
-stupid weapons
-very, very short levels
-very, very short game
-you will get lost (no mini-map)
-not as funny as tv show
-too hard for kids
-too boring for adults",negative

1360,"This is a HUGE disappointment from Relic/THQ.
Contrary to the hype and advertisements, this game does NOT have the following features:
1) New units are very few & the ones important, like Tiger Ace are NOT available in Skirmish games (90% of the game type being played).
2) Performance is poor: I have a high-end system (9800 GTX+ card and 4GB RAM). I used to play Company of Heroes and Opposing Fronts at High/Ultra setting. Now i have to reduce the setting to Medium to play at same framerates on same maps
3) No major improvements in unit types or qualities: Opposing Fronts was a game changer and was worth the money spent on it. This ToV does NOT change any paradigm, except, probably slowing down your system.
4) Bugs aplenty: Relic has released it before the depression deepens and people have no money to left its product. So there is a HUGE list of bugs from AI, to UI: All you previous medals are wiped out. You need to start afresh. The computer cheats against you by refusing to obey your orders. For instance when playing against the computer AI, if you order a Tank to attack a MG Nest, it will refuse to attack it, or show its backside to Anti-Tank weapons: deliberately. This amounts to Treason.
5) Huge Size: Although Relic has moved towards Steam and Impulse releases (I love Impulse), the size precludes any reasonable imagination. 7.5GB ? Come on.
6) Mods disabled. Relic, in its infinite wisdom, thought that players should NOT write mods for it. Excussse me Relic: Mods are what made your game popular in the first place. Disabling them for NO reason defies all logic and reason. But then Relic produced a Tea Coaster and made us pay $39.99 for the same, so i guess they want to close shop.

The only thing that keeps me from throwing them away is I might be able to use them for halloween props!

We must use load out boxes and ammo refill crates. I really cant recommend this to any long term cod fans. Enemies are hard to see. Another thing i hate is the fact that the whole screen turn red we I get shot by someone. I hate fighting machines, robots and drones. I think they made this too futuristic and realistic.

Be an informed consumer, research what these programs do.

Boring character customization and guns. No hero only battles.

I miss mos eisley assault. Fighting as wookies and wampas. Having to do well to get the chance to play as a stronger character. Four player local play. There's just not enough maps or heroes.

I keep finding more things to be disappointed about. The game is pretty, has a good soundtrack and controls well. But in the end it's like a battlefield game with less content.

A five star match nets you 200 experience any skill over 63 requires double that to move up one point and that's if you actually can somehow win, you lose and you get 30.

1378,"The greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time.

To begin I will provide Amazon's customer base the ""tale of the turd"" as I call it in relation to this abomination's ""quality"" or rather lackthereof:

Gameplay: Utterly challengeless. A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or ""spam"" the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.

Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.

Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.

Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.

Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.

This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque ""Screw you!"" to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.

Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.

To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: ""Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!""

We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.

Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.

Aonuma's first game ""Marvelous"" failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.

When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.

Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.

In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more:
Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).

Conclusion: My rating of this turd is 1 star since I can't give it lower due to how Amazon's system is set up.",negative

I can't think of a worse  way to spend my time.  The gameplay involves clicking something, clicking somewhere else, then clicking something again.

1407,"For the past year my Xbox One has been shut down for the most part, because I simply haven't found anything interesting to do on it.. I regret giving up my Xbox 360 with a decent collection of games (including Kinect-enabled ones) - because there is still a huge gap between the games available for the One and 360. As an example, Limbo debited 3+ years ago on Xbox 360, and it just came out on Xbox One. I enjoyed Fruit Ninja over 2 years ago, and it's still not available for Xbox One!! Such a let-down.

Please explain why they made a new console that won't play Xbox 360 games? That's really stupid, and I have only myself to blame because I trusted Microsoft to port existing games quickly, since they've decided to break compatibility on purpose.

I would also like to point out that Xbox One games/apps are sluggish despite the up-to-date hardware. For example, Xbox Fitness is absolutely painful to use, as it loads a full minute (which feels like an eternity) and all animations and transitions are horribly rough.

Another source of frustration is the dashboard UI. Browsing for games (which I do frequently, hoping to find something interesting) is very confusing?! It's either one flat list of all games, or poorly defined categories with very limited number of titles. And I can't still figure out how to rate and review games/apps...

Finally, the prices for games for purchase on the console (downloadable) are regularly ~2 times higher than same titles on a disc (e.g. Amazon). That's just a shameless rip-off. They are definitely not passing the savings (media/distribution/commissions) on to consumers.",negative

The rubber contacts on the buttons are made out of some ridiculously cheap rubber that even the Chinese knockoff makers would probably laugh at, and it was not long before my X button started sticking when it was depressed. For fighting games like Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deception, you NEED lightning fast response from the buttons. One sticky button completely ruins this controller, and eventually all of them will wear out due to the terrible material Logitech uses.

I actually considered picking up a Logitech wireless PS3 controller at one point since it uses the same form factor, and hoping that Logitech finally learned their lesson about the crappy material, I figured it would be easy to swap out the rubber contacts from the PS3 controller to restore my PS2 controller better-than-new. However, I learned ahead of time that Logitech uses the same crappy material in the PS3 controllers, and the buttons wear out just as quickly! I will probably never buy a Logitech controller again. My official PS2 controllers still work just fine after many years of making Jak and Daxter jump platforms and doing kombos and fatalities in Mortal Kombat, and that durability is worth putting up with wires for. Logitech's terrible neglect for quality materials ruined what would have otherwise been the ultimate controller for PS2 owners.

*UPDATE*

Recently I decided to take a stab at replacing the rubber contacts on the controller for old times's sake, and now there is a new problem: the piece of junk doesn't even sync up with the receiver anymore. I have tried every single ""solution"" suggested by Logitech on their forums, and when none of them work the mods are always extremely evasive and simply start ignoring the people who are having the sync problem. Maybe not everyone is as unlucky as me as with these controllers, but I can say with confidence that a great many of them were sadly not built to last. There is no way to repair a faulty wireless transmitter as far as I can tell, so now I have a wireless controller with perfect buttons that doesn't do anything except sit their and look pretty. Logitech really dropped the ball with this controller and I feel like the terrible experience I had has soiled my opinion of their gaming products in general. Perfectly crafted ergonomics doesn't count for anything when the device simply does not work, and even my ugly Pelican wireless controller that has inferior ergonomics to the official PS2 controller still works like new, while the Logitech one has become a pretty looking brick that I have sunk too many hours into trying to rescue.

Logitech only had the official Playstation license for these controllers during their initial run, and then Sony revoked their licensing agreement, causing Logitech to release their final batch under generic branding with no Playstation symbols on it. Now we know why. Sony makes products that last for years, and Logitech's quality control and customer service did not meet the standards needed for an official Playstation product.",negative
1415,"No games on this console worth buying at even garage sale prices. This thing will on-and-off refuse to connect to the internet (and yes, I tried it on various networking devices). I probably spent an hour of online time in the vague 20 hours of use I got out of it. In the middle of one online session, the signal it was sending to the tv became a digital mess, and the gamepad lost connection. I tried various things, and even tried calling customer support. They have nice voices and attitudes, but I don't know if they have ears. I told them all the various things I tried, and they made me try them several times over.

I already disliked nintendo to begin with, but I got this console to play Sonic Lost World (as I am a fan of the series) and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate (with a friend who lives a fair distance away). If anyone else has the mindset to get a wiiu for any purpose, I would strongly advise against it. I just gave the console to a computer shop in the town I live in and I was able to get money for the games and gamepad, but it pales in comparison to the money I could've gotten selling it online. I pity the buyers out there paying any more than $40 for the controllers, let alone the console or games.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not so angry that I can't think. I'm not exaggerating at all, though, either. The only person I know other than myself who has a wiiu is that friend I wanted to play Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate with, and they also have constant connection problems.",negative
1416,"This looks absolutely awful on Xbox One. It's blurrier than a previous generation game.  See comparison videos on YouTube.

1418,"We were more than patient with you with BF 1942 because it was revolutionary and eventually the patches caught up and there was expansion goodness for everyone.

We were forgiving with BF Vietnam for the balancing, bugginess, lack of standard features, and maps just so we could have all the helicopter goodness.

We were excited and then quickly disappointed by BF 2 with all the same problems showing up yet a third time along and a lacking of features promised in the last two versions along with a crop of other things such as rampant cheating and patch updates that were almost non-existant.

I'll admit we're a bit slow, but if you think we're going to throw money yet a fourth time your way, for what amounts to a mod, a buggy mod at that, with the great new feature being adware, wow you're dumber than we are.

I for one am going to pass.  I'll check back in six months, if it lasts that long.  Hopefully by then all the patches and balancing will be done.  If that is the case, then I'll think about picking it up.

JUST TO BE FAIR

Just be fair I went back and gave it another try. Here is how it went.

Another 22 hour download. Nice
Reintstalled Dx9
Reinstalled game
Game crashed first attempt, but came up second time no problems.
I see that the jump to center, bug/characteristic is still in the control menu, annoying, but tollerable. It's been there since the 1942 version.
Getting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts. For some reason it was dead set on keeping W set to nothing. I don't use WASD I use ESDF, more keys to the left to use. Similar problems setting up the joystick and mouse, but nothing serious, just had to play a game solo and jump into the menu 10-15 times to keep changing things back, again another characteristic that has been with us since 1942.
Video is similar to BF2, as long as I don't max them out it is very smooth.

No widescreen support, big thumbs down. Closest thing to 1900x1200 is 1600x1200. Some warping, but playable. Sorry kiddies who think wide screen is cheating, I like my 24"" monitor and like having a wider view.

The optimizing shaders annoyance is back from BF2. If you change video setting expect a 5 minute or more wait till it optimizes something. Don't know why this couldn't be done before you try to enter a map in the background, so you are going to be late to the fight the first time after a change.

Game play that I tried was Titan. Interesting concept, though nothing original it's been around since the days of UT and RtCW. Moving around and launching aircraft onboard the Titan is buggy quite a bit of the time. The ship moves around subtly causing things to get hung up.
Weapons seem to be more accurate, but classes feel kind of generalized due to the reduction in total numbers.
Sound quality is still pretty muted and generic, all the weapons sound alike, but at least they've finally figured out what 3d sound is. You know which way it's coming from now.

The powered lift craft, they're not helicopters, they're not airplanes. It feels like they're found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity. BFV they were crazy sensitive, BF2 they felt like you were flying with your hands numb. I personally like things light and sensitive, it took a lot of skill to fly them, but this should help get people up to speed faster and make people less afraid of jumping in with random pilots.

Looks like the helicopter instant roll over and play dead bug is still in the game.

The ground vehicles are so so. The weapons have some interesting characteristics, like the curve ball grenades on the walker. Other than that nothing really new.

Lot's of gun stabilization on vehicle guns finally make accurate passenger support fire possible while on the move.

There is no cover or vegetation which to speak of, but then none of the BF games ever have had much. I like the fatigue bar, but it's a LONG run between things to hide behind, so anyone on foot is still going to be constantly caught out in the open.

The indestructable chain link fences make a return to the game ready to stop your 80 ton tank dead in it's tracks.

Light vehicles aren't all that fast and explode almost instantly upon contact with water. Seems even in the future that is still a problem. The walker can wade accross no problems.

I saw one of the infamous billboards. It was green and simple said ""The Enemy is out there"" So right they are, but I didn't notice any more than that. No adds. I'd rather if they were going to stuff adds in the game to have them in the menu while you are looking for a server to join rather than in the game. The classic ""Brought to you by Brand X"" type placements there would be less strange.

This game feels very much like a mod, it still needs some tweeking to get some things right. The Menu system is still quirky, but seems to be actually stable, which is an absolute first for any BF game. Simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent. It's not hard, but it's not obvious either.

There is nothing that interesting to a long time BF vet to make me want to pay money for it. I find the whole thing kind of boring. There are better games out there that suck you into the action better. It seems that DICE didn't bother lifting any ideas from the many games that have come out since they have come onto the scene.

I downgrade my opinion from flame to yawn.

Wars are dirty, loud, confusing, overwhelming, and dented. This game delivers none of that. Even BF2 for all it's warts still seems to be the much better game.",negative

1422,"I love Final Fantasy.  I really do.  The World is Square, baby!  (FFI reference).

I wasted a perfectly good giftcard on this puddle of cow vomit because of the fact I saw Square on the cover.  I envision, at Square-Enix headquarters, there is a little room in the basement where the company meets its ""hire the handicapped"" quota.  They spake unto them and said, ""Hark!  I speaketh to thee and bade thee...maketh an RPG!"" and the retards made an RPG and Square saw that it was crap...and that it was bad.  Then Square spoke and said, ""Oh ye of little mental aptitude...I thanketh thee for thine efforts...however, now I must smother thou with a pillow."" and Square smothered the handicapped with a pillow...but not until a few escaped into the battle mechanics room of the Final Fantasy series.

The graphics are vile, the characters two-dimensional, and the combat is something right out of one of those little AA games in the plastic armor hanging on a pegboard shelf in K-Mart.  A rusty Tin Man who's had his joints welded together and eyes riveted shut could move with more fluidity than the sprites in this piece of crap.  Also, the game leaves you with a realization of what a storyline is, since you're so busy LOOKING and WAITING for one to develop within this game.

I viewed this game as a metophorical giant loog wad of yak-spit right in my suck-hole.  Seriously...Square...FOR SHAME!  This game is the equivalent of my PS2 powering on and then nipple-twisting me until I bleed and finishing up with a swift kick to the crotch.

I hate this game more than I hate getting an eyelash stuck in my eyeball...more than when you sit down on a dark leather or vinyl seat in the summer and the nuclear heat sears the skin on the small of your back and back of your knees...I hate this game more than when you go on a water ride at a theme park and your underwear chafe your taint (the area between the crotch and butt).

Seriously, I had a colonoscopy about four years ago and I had to drink this oily lemon-lime stuff that made me squirt clear liquid and wasn't allowed to eat anything for 24 hours so that it felt like my stomach was eating itself and I wanted to die.  Well...this game wasn't quite THAT bad but at least with the colonoscopy I knew it was going to be a horrible experience.  This is a VIDEO GAME.  Dance all happy and free while you put it in the system thinking, ""Another AWESOME RPG from Squaresoft!!!"" and then suddenly you're doing the video game equivalent of gagging down a gallon of Quaker State with lime and squirting clear liquid from your o-ring.

You think I'm kidding?  Do you KNOW where this game disk of mine is right now?  A landfill.  LANDFILL!  Know why?  Because I THREW IT AWAY!  I was moving and consolidating some boxes and THERE IT WAS on the bottom of a box...staring at me.  I looked around...thought about it...and tossed that piece of twice-tossed monkey dung right in the freaking trash.  Did I want the $3 credit from the gamestore?  NOPE!  I refused to subject any other human being, decent or indecent, to the vile putridity of this shiny circular turd.  I feel guilty that I didn't snap the disk in half first for fear some homeless kid living outside the dump and stealing electricity from a storage shed's power outlet might find this game and try it.

That means no more online gaming for your Wii Mario Kart and no more any of those things that many bought this console for. It in effect becomes half the game console it used to be. Nintendo stated that it was doing so in order to focus on the WiiU. I cannot understand this move as Nintendo has a deep pocket and surely could afford to maintain a network for the Wii console while supporting the WiiU. Take a look at the Playstation 3 which is still going strong and still boasts a robust network which is free I might add. And at the same time supporting the Playstation 4.

Recently, I found Project Gotham 3 in a used bin and I bought it for $4.  It ends up that the game was absolutely brilliant.  It was just like R4, only better.

So, after beating the game, I immediately ran out and bought PGR 4, and also Forza 2, even though Forza was a different style racing game.  Anyway, I put in PGR4, my hands twitching to race at ludicrous speeds once again.

After 2 races, I crashed my motorcycle and came in last.  No big deal, I assured myself.  It's all about the cars, not the bikes.

I raced three races, on easy difficulty, with a car I was familiar with from PGR3.
I came in last every time.  Normally, not being a big race game fan, I'd have excused my lack of winning as a lack of skill.  Again, not a huge race fan.

BUT I HAD JUST ANNIHILATED PGR3 ONLY HOURS EARLIER.

How different did it have to be, the perfect racing game?  Why even mess with success?  I don't know exactly what was tweaked, but it was enough to turn what had been a superb racing game into a complete suckfest.  After a few more failed attempts at enjoyment, I LITERALLY THREW THE GAME AWAY.

Here's my experience...

--I've loaded the game on 4 different computers with no success (one of them a brand new Alienware computer).

--I've even tried completely re-installing windows XP, and still the game would not run on a ""clean"" system.

--Initially tech support said they couldn't help me and pawned me off to their licensing company...who said that they don't do tech support and said I needed to talk with Aspyr.

--Aspyr said that I should just patch the product and it would work fine.  When I said I already did that (under multiple tries), they said to try it again.... *Sigh*

--I've read on some boards that XP service pack 2 can mess up the game.  I suggested that to support but they flat out denied it.  I then installed XP (with SP2) onto a formatted computer...and again the game would not run.

However, while I won't ever bother watching Happy Feet Two in any sort of form, the video game tie-in toyed with those expectations constantly. This game was created by Wayforward, a development team known to make some pretty good games for cartoon shows and movies alike, as well as the now-well-known Shantae series. Despite that, though, I'd still hastily toss this one away.

Happy Feet Two is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer plagued by the many problems tolerable or better quality platformers tend to avoid; Mumble moves too slow, and there's no run button, the levels are dull and repetitive since they are structured similarly just with different layouts, slowdown can occur even when there's seemingly no reason why it should, the boss fights are utterly pathetic and drag for too long, and the secondary characters you unlock don't even do JACK because they can only be onscreen temporarily and when their times are up the camera focuses back on Mumble anyway!

The game does try to spruce things up a LITTLE bit.

Another problem I have faced was that the game crashed a lot! You have to save frequently, and it takes forever to save. It's just like The Sims, it take 2 minutes to save! I loaded this game on my Windows 2000 and would crash when you got to the preloader. Then I bought a Windows XP and it would crash every 30 to 60 minutes.

I hope I made an impact on your decision not to buy this game it's not worth the money and it has many flaws. If you want to just try the game buy it used.",negative
1456,"The seller was buynowlv. I paid 9 bucks. It worked fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3.

I took a chance on this game based on what I read about it, and based on the good reviews.

It's about mobsters, cops/robbers, and organized crime; so, you can expect scenes with drugs, prostitutes, etc. I thought the game was dark/gloomy.

An example of gameplay:
Open a door and there are mobsters to kill; kill them.  Then go around a corner...same thing. Over & over again. I thought it was boring, and I stopped playing after an hour or so.

I would rather replay a game that I previously enjoyed than play this game for the first time. Before you buy this one, check-out some of the gameplay videos on youtube.

1458,"Wow, I don't know where to start.  This game was just ported horribly from 360 to PC.  So much so that they should've just thrown it in the trash instead of release it.  I'll start off with the fact that they must've been on something good when they decided not to add 1680x1050 resolution support for this game.  I mean, what the heck is up with that?  I think the majority of gamers will have monitors with a resolution of 1680x1050, in other words, most 20""-22"" monitors, yet they didn't add support for it.  Hardcore gamers might have a 1920x1080, or 1980x1200 display, but what about those of us who thought 22"" was sufficient enough.  Okay, so I get over that issue by choosing the next resolution down that maintain's a 16:10 aspect ratio (1280x800), so the game looks OK at this resolution, but everyone knows that putting a LCD Monitor on anything other than it's native resolution really makes it quite blurry.

Ok, so I accept the blurriness but the game doesn't even feel like it's reaching 20FPS.  What's up with that.  I mean, my computer is pretty up to date with all recent technology.  I have not one, but two, GTX 280's in SLi, as well as the newest Phenom II processor released which is at a stock of 3.0GHz, however I have it overclocked to 3.6GHz, and I also have 8GB's of 800MHz DDR2 RAM.  You can imagine this system is quite awesome for Crysis, running usually a minimum of around 40-45PFS, even during intense scenes, and getting up to a max of around 80FPS.  So, why, does Saints Row 2, which is quite inferior in graphics, play at 20FPS and less?  Not sure myself but it sure does suck.  Sure, turning graphics down to low makes it run at a better FPS, but I didn't spend well over $1,500 on my PC to play a game on low settings.  I'm quite appalled by this, though I suppose I can't complain seeing as their competitor (Rockstar) didn't do too much better themselves on GTA IV.

Now, I regret not getting Saints Row 2 on 360 when it came out, because I was oh so sure the PC version would be amazing...boy was I wrong.  So anyway, those problems out of the way, there are still tons of other glitches and things that others have mentioned before.  One of the most prominent being items popping up out of no where.  Now, I understand it's a huge city, just like in GTA IV, but is it too much to ask for items to ""pop in"" maybe when I'm still five feet away instead of about one foot away.

All in all, the two games I were waiting for the most on PC (GTA IV, and Saints Row 2) both failed for me.  GTA IV is playable, but it seems much better on 360 than PC.",negative
1459,"I have owned 2 AX360s and 1 AXPRO and I have had so send the AXPRO twice to get replaced!!!I use them with my xbox 360 for all my games specially for COD4 and GOW2. Dont get me wrong, they sound great but.......

 The internal mic connection fails and they have had to replace the headset every time!!I would rather use my AX360 even though they don't reproduce any base and the only way to control the in-game voice is to raise the center channel. I don't know you but I rather have a product that is not so good but reliable than something that breaks in 1 month and sounds good. By the way the first time I sent them in was because they already came with the same problem. The second time it happened I was using them and they just stopped receiving any sound through the mic. I bought various 2.5mm to 2.5mm male extension cables the first time it happened cause I though it was a faulty cable they brought only to find out that the problem was within the actual headset (confirmed by the fact that the company replaced my headset with a new pair).It actually feels like the company rushed into launching them and didn't actually test the product.

Go with the AX 360s or higher end Astro A40s if you can afford them cause they're very expensive but from what Ive read you really get what you pay for. One last thing, the customer service and its personnel are very good but this can only help you so much if the product is awful.",positive

1463,"Granted I'm not all that great at fighting games, but I can usually at least muddle my way through a few levels and squeeze some fun out of a game. This game wasn't what I expected at all. The controls are extremely clunky. You have to be in a particular spot to pick up an object, and it's way too easy to stand on top of it instead. Trying to pull off moves seems random at times, with the game favoring the enemy as far as timing goes.

The story is nearly nonexistent. ""So-and-so is at the bridge, go stop him from damaging it."" Why even bother? And what's the point of unlocking characters if you don't get to choose who you can play as? It takes forever to fight one round, and you have to win 2 out of 3 to win the match.

1464,"I won't bother to review this controller based on its features or capabilities, that's already been done.

Fundamentally, this controller doesn't work. The left analog stick will randomly ""stick"" or fail while playing games. The physical stick works great, but the game will react as if you are holding the stick in one direction when you have actually released it, or moved it in a different direction.
It does this intermittently and at random, and when it goes cock-eyed it may last for seconds or minutes. This made playing some games like Bioshock Infinite a bit of a challenge but not undoable. However a dual-stick shooter is impossible to play, unless your idea of playing a game is to play it like a retarded 4 year old.

I've updated the drivers (which are 3 years old), replaced batteries and re-calibrated it. Logitech support is, as usual, useless. You can search and find thousands of people reporting this problem and others.

This is a highly rated controller on Amazon for two reasons:
1) Cheap people who are more excited about the money they saved
2) Shills for Logitech",neutral

1472,"O.K.  I will keep it short and sweet.  I thought the idea of brushing up on my opponents psychological profiles and reading dossiers to plan my missions would be fun.......but in reality, none of this mattered at all in the game.  Here are the problems with the game so you don't have to read a long review.  I am only sharing MY opinion and it may not reflect your own, however, it is difficult to imagine a reasonable person would not find the following issues a bit troubling.

1.  Terrible AI always knows where you are.  You can hide behind walls, use stealth and plan your route.  All to no avail.  They will find you without even seeing you.  The cover system is also broken, with constant problems.

2.  Broken battle mechanics.  You're telling me I spent all this time learning of my foes and hacking computers and alarms to need to shoot a hypersensitive  guard who can run 50 mph IN THE HEAD FOUR TIMES before he is eliminated?  When did they invent bullet proof heads?

3.  The hacking and alarm overrides in the game could be fun, if they were not so hard to complete within a reasonable amount of time.  I have nothing against difficulty, it makes a game challenging.  However in this case, they took it a little too far. Be reasonable.

4.  All of the reading and planning missions, even weapon selection have absolutely no bearing on the game as the developer would lead you to believe.

5.  Most of you are going to want the few hours of time you gave to this game back.  They should pay you to play this game.",negative

The headset is not consistant and automatically turn on when I turn on my Xbox in which I did not want it to do since now it waste batteries and will have to charge during the worst moment during an multiplayer watch. I don't like that there is no battery option to insert as with charging it with a usb cord will deteriate quickly over time.

1477,"I hate to give this one star since the company does support a lot of Call of Duty players and groups but I'm being completely honest here.  These things are a piece of junk!  When I first tried these there was a huge learning curve of having the control sticks height higher than normal.  I took a licking at about a dozen games before I finally got used to having these on my control.  As for better accuracy let's just say it initially made accuracy worst because of what I feel is a lengthy learning curve, you don't just pop these puppies on and instantly become better.

Maybe someone with very large hands might benefit from these but I consider my hands to be average in size so I found myself reaching for the buttons.  My hands felt somewhat cramped at times but not completely so maybe that's part of the learning curve on how to hold the controller (maybe a better slanted position; I have no clue).  I've been using these for 3 weeks now and I decided to take them off considering my purchase a complete waste of money.  Overall I truly felt having these was a complete placebo effect because even after I got used to having them on I felt my game play was no better or worse than when i didn't have these on my sticks.  At the end of the day you're either good at Call of Duty or you're not.  These did not enhance my playing experience or comfort nor did it greatly hinder my experience.",positive

1486,"I am surprised at the high rated reviews this product has gotten. I am a fighting game enthusiast and know a good Dpad when I try one. I loved the old-school Nintendo Dpad, and the Playstation 2 Dpad is also very good. They offered precise feel and control. When I got my Xbox 360, I was shocked at how poor the Dpad was on that controller. Everything else, including the analog sticks are so perfect, but the Dpad is clumsy and ineffective. I'd try to hold back to block and end up jumping or doing some other random direction.
So after reading some reviews on different products, I thought I'd give the Madcatz fightpad a try. When I received the package, I already had a gut-feeling that it was no good. This was confirmed moments later as I tried to play with it.
1) The diagonals were very difficult to locate and I couldn't hit them with any consistency. Very bad news in a fighting game. I found that I had to hit a precise 30 degree angle from the down position to get down-back, and that should be 45 degrees, not 30. But this could have been a defect in the particular controller I got, and might not be an issue in others.
2) However, I'm sure for all of these controllers, the feel of the pad would be the same. The floating Dpad is very loosey-goosey. While this makes it very easy to throw fireballs, any slight pressure will move you away from your intended position. So if you needed to hold back to block, you might accidentally jump or duck.
3) The construction/material of the controller feels very light and cheap. This wouldn't have bothered me too much if the controller worked great but it didn't, and this only added to my disappointment.",neutral

1488,"The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is a game one should only purchase if they answer yes to the following questions:

1. Do you like playing games were developers find ways to artificial extend gameplay at the expense of the player?

2. Did you like Majora's Mask?

3. Does the idea of controlling character movement by touch screen seems like a good idea?

If you can answer yes to these question, in particular 1 and 3, then you should give this game a try. If not then you should pass on this game, or at least wait for it to come down in price.

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is actually rather short in length compared to Phantom Hourglass, the only reason it seems longer is because of train travel. The train can only travel on tracks, tracks that a little later in the game are patrolled by demon trains, which forces the player to take longer routes to avoid them. Factor this with the fact that your train, even on the highest speed setting is slow as hell, makes for a very dull and boring experience. Most of your time playing this game will in fact be spent on the train. For this reason alone Spirit Tracks gets 1 star and I would recommend you avoid this game at all cost or if you must, purchase Phantom hourglass.

As for the controls it seems to have gotten worse compared to Phantom Hourglass. Precision in controls, even while controlling the train, and the fact that they changed rolling to two taps of the screen instead of the loop to loop motion can lead to accidental damage or death while playing. This issue however is minor, and one could play this game without being bothered by it too much. If you're the type of person that prefers, or would have preferred the option to use the D-Pad, try the game out before you buy it or just avoid it.

Finally the game itself is not much better than Phantom Hourglass. If you played Phantom Hourglass before, you pretty much already played this game sans trains. Although the conversations between Link and Zelda are cool, and she makes a good side kick, the story is truly no better than Phantom Hourglass. In some respects, it's worse. Spirit Tracks is the Majora's Mask of the DS, so to those of you that didn't care for Majora's Mask shouldn't bother with Spirit Tracks. Otherwise don't be surprised if you experience a lot of ""been there, done that.""

If you're a big Zelda fan and Nintendo can do no wrong ever, have fun with Spirit Tracks. If you're a gamer and want the best money can buy, I'd tell you to wait for a lower price or avoid this game entirely.

1-You can buy it for a cheap price.
2-The characters are cute little animals (well, not Elise).
That's about all I got for you. The rest is pretty much horrible...
1-Sonic takes Shadow's place (with Maria in Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Adventure 2, SA2B) by kissing a human girl...other than the fact that that point is being bitten off Shadow's story, it's utterly disgusting. They actually kiss...didn't think they were going to take it that far...Sonic, just stick to Amy!
2-The storyline is a bad attempt at a good one. Ah, well-at least they didn't waste the whole time biting off their previous games...
3-Loading times take up about half of the game, sometimes it takes so long I think my game crashed...and yet, it's not worth the wait, bringing me to my next point-
4-Glitches! It's just so easy to make a list, and most of the time, they're not funny, which is weird for me, because I usually find glitches, hacks, mistakes, and bloopers highly amusing...
5-Funny how they called it Sonic the Hedgehog after the artwork Sonic Team made for Genesis, while this one's garbage...yes, I'm even upset about the name.
6-Again with the new character thing! Yes, Shadow and Jet were okay and Chip wasn't really that bad but ELISE and SILVER! My problem with Elise: When she kisses Sonic, he comes back to life-ew. My problem with Silver: He seems to be a futuristic Sonic, and he always seems to be Mr. Perfect (not referring to Curt Hennig). In my view, a completely useless character.

1501,"With Diablo, Torchlight, and Borderlands all having lavish sequels, it's a good time to look back at Ascaron's Sacred sequel, which ended up being their final game before bankruptcy and closure.

The original Sacred was something of a sleeper hit. With solidly 2d environment graphics (the characters were 3d) it actually looked a little more dated than Diablo 2, but it had a very clean sharp aesthetic and its intense customization, huge open world, and streak of cheeky naughtiness made it a star, particularly with older gamers. In my heady college days it was a recurring LAN party favorite, although Titan Quest effectively dethroned it.

Sacred 2 was a bold attempt to do all that Sacred 1 did but with modernity. Now in full 3d, with a detail level comparable to Oblivion, dynamic lighting, and tons of environments, Sacred 2 was certainly a quantum leap forward in looks for the series. It also features a huge volume of voice acting, customizable skills (narrowly sneaking in ahead of D3's rune system) and just as many Easter eggs and rare items as its predecessor.

And yet, something about Sacred 2 feels off. The controls feel a little less responsive, and the skills feel less balanced- generally within an hour of starting you will know what moves your character will use for the rest of the game. The world is huge and visually gorgeous, yet you feel very confined to artificial paths through it- much of what you see on the map is inaccessible obstacle terrain, and by the final quarter of the game it has become hopelessly linear. And while the characters look vastly better than they did in the first title, they lack the appealing oddball character of the characters in the original (with the exception of the inquisitor, an awesome villain-protagonist who seems to be channeling Emperor Palpatine by way of a Luc Besson gangster film). Sacred 2 bombards you with exotic locations and numerous characters, but they quickly become a slog, a grindy obstacle course you shoot your way through without paying much attention. In Sacred 1 there was a joy to discovering new areas, but in spite of the lavish artistry on display 2 does not capture this fun.

Part of the problem may also be the story. Sacred 1 had a pretty easy to follow one: There is an evil wizard who has summoned a demon and you must go swat them, and also a crooked baron who is using the chaos to take over the kingdom. In the expansion it was boiled down further to ""go to hell and rescue this lady."" Sacred 2 has a huge incomprehensible plot which is never well explained, but which I will try to summarize:
-God is an alien
-The Seraphim (chesty warrior cyborg women with a predilection for laser guns and jailbait haircuts) work for God but they get tired of doing nothing all day, so they build their own planet (this all directly contradicts the lore of the first game in which Seraphim were mutant elves bred to fight demons but whatevs)
-The Seraphim's crapsack planet goes all to pot, the inhabitants all start fighting and the pipes that pump the planet's power source (a blue goo called T-Energy) start bursting, mutating wildlife into monsters and also somehow teaching people magic
-The morally gray elven government finds the source of all T-energy, a wrecked spaceship that the Seraphim apparantly did NOT build, and which is full of robot dog men
-Everyone starts fighting over T-energy and you have to make your way to the spaceship and fight giant robot ants so you can either shut it off or exploit its power
Not one bit of this makes sense or is worth following, and indeed the game is at its best when you are engaging in a series of unrelated quests.

I am picking on Sacred 2 awfully hard, but the truth is that it was a step in the right direction. Unlike Sacred 1, it was visually modern, sumptuously designed, and in spite of being total nonsense, worth playing at least once. If you choose to however, I recommend against this version. The more complete Sacred 2 Gold, which includes the Ice and Blood expansion is now available on Steam, and while you can modify the US release of Sacred 2 to accept the Europe-only expansion, the all-in-1 represents a better value proposition.

Mention must also be made of multiplayer: It was horribly laggy at launch, and as far as I know, is now dead (unless current IP owner Deep Silver maintains it). Were I you I would not buy this game expecting a satisfying coop experience.

PROS:
-Looks Great
-Soundtrack includes music by German epic metal legends Blind Guardian!
-Tons of skills, loot, and customization
-Huge gameworld to explore

CONS:
-Less rewarding and re-playable than Sacred 1 or many competing contemporaries
-Awkward feel to controls
-Largely forgettable cast
-Quickly becomes numbingly easy
-Little incentive to complete higher difficulties
-Requirements far exceed what you get visually

OTHER NOTES:
-The collector's edition of this game came with a high-def texture pack that confers lag-inducing beauty upon the world. You can download this both as an official patch and unofficial mod pack.
-One of the game's strongest points is that each character has their own campaign alongside the main story, and this campaign further changes depending on your alignment. This feature was meant to appear in Sacred 1, but except for the Vampiress, all the character's arcs end when the reach the first hub town.
-Sacred 1 was released censored for violence in the US. Not so with 2; you can dismember your enemies with abandon now.
-For all its mucking about with Canon, Sacred 2 is a solid prequel in many ways. The high elven society in 2 will eventually collapse into the aescetic wood elves and depraved, decadent dark elves of the first title, and the Dryads will eventually be trapped in the underworld by the time of the first game. Dwarves, for some reason, are absent from Sacred 2, although by all rights they should be all over the place. Then again, this game could easily be a prequel in name only, nothing that happens in-game explicitly precedes the first title.
-The high elf's story arc is entirely about her trying to get out of Student Loan debt. Methinks one of the writers was a little bitter about college.",positive

1503,"Decent graphics with sometimes jaw-dropping thought to detail (e.g., pitchers wearing jackets on basepaths, broken bats, etc.).  That said, game is too damn hard to win.  I'm very good at baseball games, and I haven't beaten the CPU in about 25 games.  I'm frustrated as hell with it.  Not that I need the ease of Triple Play to boost the ole' ego, but come on!!
I'm looking forward to checking out World Series baseball, I'll leave it at that.",negative
1504,"When Diablo II came out I bought it immediately expecting it would be at least as fun as the first possibly more fun.
I got bored of the game easily.  The thing I really didn't like was certain enemys that just run  away. You have to chase them for what seems like an eternity till you  finally catch them and slaughter them, and if you decide to just let them  run away they'll continuously come back to haunt you. Then to make things  worse the game doesn't save what you've killed so if you decide your done  playing for the day the next time you play all the runners will be back.  These enemys are called flayers and when I first encountered them I got  bored of fighting them over and over and discontinued my gameply and moved  to a different game.
Another thing I didn't like is running. Not that  running is bad, in fact I love the fact that you can move faster, the  problem with it is that the background (trees, grass, etc.) really bothered  my eyes with it scrolling past so quickly. That is not as big a deal as the  run-a-way enemys, however.
If you like to chase endless hords of enemys  then the game is for you.  If not don't bother with it.",negative
1505,"Although the game includes the really interesting Nemesis system in which Orc bosses will be replaced or promoted in regards to you beating them or dying against them, Shadow of Mordor was a game that was so dull and drab and disappointing that I couldn't even finish. The world is little more than different shades of brown, the combat is shallow and the story is generic.

You're better off playing an Assassins' Creed game (and that should really be saying something about the quality of this game).",positive
1506,"I decided to purchase this game because people have been giving it high ratings and good reviews.

If you want to run around and just shoot at people and not do much else then you will probably like this game.

The worst part about this game is that it doesn't save as often as it should. You die 3 times before being able to get past one section of the level and after you get to the next part of the level you die and have to start the whole level over from the beginning. This is both frustrating and annoying.

For me I want to just get through the game and enjoy myself doing it and this game did not do that for me.",negative

1508,"I am a huge Metroid fan now and have been from the NES glory days. I'm not a fan of FPS games but still tried the Metroid Prime series and wasn't disappointed at all.

The other M is a different take on the Metroid series and a pretty interesting one at that. We all have our opinion as to why Samus was the way she was based on past games, and of course past games have kind of cemented a persona in our minds as to who she was too. However, we all have a past, and experiences and people we come in contact with have all played a part in making us who we are now, whether we like it or not. The story may not have played out the way we would have envisioned and it may not be as flashy as we would have liked but you must remember every story has a beginning and in this case a lot of surprises. Samus didn't come out in a diapers and an arm cannon on her arm LOL. I've also heard a lot of complaints about the story in regard to her using her weapons, but you have to understand as unrealistic as it may sound certain allowances need to be made to make the game playable.

The controls are very different than most games to say the least, and does take time to get used to, however once you do it's manageable but far from perfect.

My advice, avoid this game if you're a Metroid fan, because you will be let down.

I'm not sure of my Wii number, and truthfully no reason really to remember it. My gamertag on PSN and XBox 360 is MikeJMele.

1509,"I should have learned my lesson from the Family Fun Pack.  The Sims2 fan in me just had to have everything though (for some reason I resisted the Holiday pack...).

Pros

-Some nice new items.  I liked the new stereo, as well as some of the new decorations.  Some of the new clothing looks cool too.  I've found more of the new items useful than those from Family Fun Pack.

Cons

-Price!  $19.99 for these few new items?  The additions in this pack are not worth more than $5.00 (maybe less)!

-Some of the new items weren't worth a dime!  Though some of the new clothing may look good, most of it I would never select for one of my Sims.

In Summary:

The term ""Glamour Life"" has a number of implications behind it.  A new type of car would have been nice (or at least more color options on the existing ones).  New party items, some sort of nod toward jewelry, and other pricey items would have been nice as well.  So much more could have been done with that theme!  What this pack gives you though, is a major disappointment.  The price doubles the disappointment.  If you can live without it, wait until it hits the bargain bins.  Hopefully the Pets Expansion will make up for this disappointment.",positive
1510,"Alright so I usually love and adore Sims games. And always love the first ones. Now I can and remember I said CAN play the first and 2nd Sims without the expansions and smile and have fun;
Now With Sims 3 please tell me what happened!

When Sims 3 came out, I bought it right away, I was extremely eager to play it. All I know is that when I started playing man was I disappointing

I've never seen such terrible looking Sims..
Was this supposed to up the realism?
It degraded x99999999

I played the game jittery and jubilant, eager. Started to look at the Neighborhood and I was already angry, why in the world is there only one town? I am still also trying to figure out if you can make extra spots for houses when you run out of spots that the EA creaters already provide
I go online and get the extra neighborhood to be disappointed AGAIN, it's the same crap basically who wants that? I don't even use it, it was a complete wasted to make.

Another issue I had was when I started to build my sims. I wanted this game because of the ultimate customization. But 'Ultimate' was a complete lie. I expected to be able to make like a friend of mine who's skinny has no hips but big boobs. I wanted ultimate customization. Where I could make every single thing to a different size. etc. NO it's not like that. You get to customize your sims body size as in whether to make them fat or skinny but to be honest they all look very chunky in my opinion because of how the sims were made

I hate the hair in the sims 3, hate the make-up, hate the clothes, it's horrid! Create-A-Sim is the worst part of the game in my opinion. Now moving on to the neighborhood after you've finished the creating bull crap I picked a house something reasonable. Now here's a few good things I adored.

Loved how your sims could freely roam around in sims 3 that's a major plus
Loved how you could properly turn your furniture at a diagonal degree
Loved how you could customize the coloring of almost E V E R Y T H I N G
Loved how nice the graphics were

Here comes MORE problems
Why in the world DID they make it so that you couldn't see your sims work and go in stores etc. I find that incredibly stupid! Why in the world would you even release this game with what's it called 'rabbit holes?' whatever

It's retarded.
Bluntly retarded
I would have never released the game with such poor quantity in the game
I was so disappointing to the point where I wanted to chuck the game out of the window and beg for my 50$ that I spent on this stupid game

Another issue. I just have to get at this. Why in the WORLD is there NO jacuzzi? Please someone tell me. OH and also. Why is there only 1 place they can 'woohoo' at? I mean I don't mean to sound like a sexual fiend but I found it entertaining at all the cool little spots that you can find; So far I've only found the bed. And I think that's ludicrous. I thought that there would be something much better.

Why do the sims no matter what look so damn fat?
I mean I'm not the skinniest but  I liked how the sims 2 looked like. Now they make them look like big tubs of lard?
I don't understand
I wanted to make a skinny face & body
I can't do it
I've tried
I can't

I'm going to STOP complaining and just finish
I'm flabbergasted at how badly the game was made
and now that the expansion pack is commig out soon
..
I HIGHLY doubt i'll buy it
This game I swear was the biggest let down of the year for me;
It was just terrible to release it so soon.
And you know what
They better make it so that it's better then sims 2. Instead of me finding & buying new things for sims 3
I'm going to stick to my full collection of sims 2 & sims 1

This game is terrible
I would NEVER recommend it to someone who wants to play a good sim game.

I can't get my money back
Nor the wasted hours on such a horrid game;

-Nichole",negative
1511,"This game used to be cool, and one of the Best MMO's out there.

However, in the past few months, Sony Online Entertainment has completely scraped the original game coding and rewritten it from scratch.

There used to be 30+ professions to play, and players used to be able to mix them and be hybrids.

Now there are only 9 professions, and players are stuck in their jobs... You wanna be a Smuggler, great your a smuggler, only there is no smuggling existent in the game... and you can't play your favorite Stars Wars musical instrument anymore in the Cantina's... as a side job.

The Combat System in the game has been overhauled at least twice in the last few months, the original system completely scraped and re-coded from scratch.

All these changes to the game are forced upon the players by SOE, and the players have to download them from SOE's servers to make sure their installed version is up to date with SOE's version.

Some of the downloads take hours, some even days for Dial Up users.  I have to burn all the downloaded updates into a CD or DVD for a friend of mine, and mail them to her because she gets them quicker that way.. because her Dial Up takes 36+ hours to download the biggest updates, and she can only let the download run for a few hours a day.

The game, at the present time... November 21st, 2005... the Game sucks.  SOE keeps promising changes to make things better, but they're either not coming fast enough for the players... or they just never come out with the cxhange at all... Smuggler's have been waiting 2 years now for the ""promised"" ability to be able to Smuggle in the game... Players are cancelling their accounts left and right.

SOE, on the day of their latest, and largest recode of the game... two weeks ago, Fired their Community Correspondent (Tiggs, a very popular person with the players) who is their voice between us the Players.. and them... because they didn't like what she was telling them what we were saying about the changes.

The game is supposed to be set in the timeperiod between the first two, Original Movies... Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back...

Yet LucasArts is producing the Expansions for this game and they keep pushing in Episode II and III content... instead of content designed for the correct time line.  Not only that, the new Clone Wars Content... is far better then the current timeline content... which supposed to be 20 years more advanced.

Jedi's... You wanna play a Jedi... this should be called, Star Wars: KOTOR Online.  The Jedi Population is out of control and it was SOE's biggest mistake to allow players to become Jedi's...  They should have left that as a rarity in the game, only had a few NPC Jedi's like Luke Skywalker in the game, as novelties for offering special Quests...

But no... they wanted to let players be Jedi's as a selling point.

How many Jedi did you see charging across the Hoth Battle Field with Luke, to take down the Imperial Walkers?

In Star Wars: Galaxies... there will be several hundred of them out there on Hoth... if SOE and LucasArts ever gets around to adding Hoth.

They're too busy adding Episode II and III content like the planets Kashyyyk and Mustafar... speaking of which, if you're a Jedi then you can go to Mustafar and help save Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost; whose ""lost his way"" ... how lame is that?

Now, they can't remove the Jedi from the game like they should.. because they hyped up being Jedi so much that ""everyone and their mother"" has one, or has played one... and would cry, bitch and comlain if SOE removed them.

SOE is ""claiming"" all these changes are making the game feel more ""Star Wars"" like... however within the last two weeks they have destroyed the in-game player economy, destroyed the orininal 30 Player Professions and redesigned 9 new ones... removed the ability to play a Hybrid Profession.. and turned the game into a massive online FPS that seems like it is based off of the KOTOR Timeline, instead of the Timeline it is supposed to be based off of... and ruined the combat system.

Do not buy this game.

If you want to play a Star Wars game, go play one of the Console Games like Star Wars: KOTOR series... or the new BattleFront series.

At present, this is probably one of the worst Star Wars Games ever made now.

It is all thanks to mismanagement and bad design ideas at SOE and  LucasArts... who both seem to think they can use this game to completely rewrite all of Star Wars history.

Maybe, someday in the future they'll get smart and fix this game... but for now... George Lucas ought to be ashamed of this game, it is an embarrassement to the Star Wars Universe.",neutral
1512,"Let me begin by saying that the camera is the most frustrating thing I have ever experienced. Every time I wanted to do something I ended up looking up her skirt. The only gold in Red Ninja is the story. Electronic Gaming may have mocked it, but I can actually see it becoming a movie. Gameplay is a bit stiff and wall running is difficult to get started sometimes. RIght now I am in a level, where I have no idea what to do. I may be forced to use a walkthrough with this game. I would suggest to you people to buy it when it when the price comes down to $20.",negative

They had slowly gotten better over the years but this is a HUGE step backwards. They're tried to add too many cheesy graphics and gimics. The new 'Advanced Shot' mechanism is awful. The game screen is cluttered with ugly markers. The graphics are literally no better than the last PS2 version. The online play is utterly confusing and unusable. This one is a total bust.

1516,I've been with this game since it's release.  Ubisoft made a poor port to the PC.  Making it useless for PC Users.  Patch 1.02 was alot smoother and less lag.  With the new patch 1.03 it pretty much ruin the game experience.  Because ubisoft wanted to add high stakes mode.  (which again is another good idea but was incomplete.)  It would be nice to have a map editor for the game to have a longer life span.  It's sad to see Team Deathmatch servers have 4 players in one and 2 in the others.  While games like Call of Duty and Valve games have tons of servers full of Players.  Their IP takes care of the games they make.  Ubisoft seriously needs to look at the actions other developers take in order to make a complete functional game.  This game was not created for the fans.  It would be nice if Redstorm entertainment came back.  Ubisoft is just ruining the R6 Series.,neutral
1517,"It's unfortunate that many reviewers (myself included) post feedback here too soon after test driving their purchases.  This time I waited 3 months.  As you can probably guess, my headset broke because of the same manufacturing flaw - the flimsy plastic extensions snapped in two even after treating it with kid gloves.  As an adult gamer, I don't play daily and I never push my hardware - yet these still broke, exactly as other reviewers have cautioned.

Otherwise, the headset is fantastic.  I did notice a slight buzzing due to the BT mic and friends on the other end of PSN chat noticed the same but apparently it was not too bothersome.  The feature-set is great and the battery life very adequate.  If it weren't for the poor material decision, these would be one of the top selling wireless gaming headset around.  Sadly the bean counters decided that adding 10 cents to their manufacturing cost would compromise sales. Unfortunately for the buyer, this proves to be a bad compromise and bad decision.

Now off to shop for a non-TB replacement !",negative
1518,"Although they have done a lot to improve the game since launch, it has many lingering issues that are hard to overlook. Basic functions that all triple A MMOs have are strangely missing from Guild Wars 2. You cannot /follow another player. There is no way to list who is playing in a particular zone. You cannot even simply hand someone an item (you must mail it to them). You can't inspect someone's gear to see what they have. There is no LFG system to find groups, or automatic dungeon finders, or even a global channel to chat.

I've been playing MMOs since Everquest 1, and this is far the ""grindiest"" mmo I've ever played or heard of. Just about everything you want to accomplish is done by doing some mundane task hundreds if not thousands of times. Lets say you want to get a best in slot ring. The only way to get this is by doing one certain 5-man dungeon (fractals of the mists). In most MMOs you would do the dungeon and get the ring, or at least have a chance of getting it. Not in GW2. To get the ring you must first do the dungeon nine times, this enables you to receive ""level 10 rewards"". Then once you are level 10, you must do the dungeon once per day for your ""fractals daily"", which will give you a token. Save up 10 of these tokens, and finally you can trade it in for a ring. This means you have to do the same dungeon 18 times over the course of at least 10 days to get a reward.

Another massive problem the game has is class balancing. They seem to not care that certain classes are incredibly powerful, where others are almost useless. If you decide to buy this game, do yourself a favor and make a warrior. As people stand around the main city spamming to form groups, the most common thing you'll see is the words ""warriors only"", because they blow away every other class as far as dps is concerned. The ideal group composition is four warriors and a mesmer (who is able to haste the group) to make the warriors do even more damage. Five warriors is almost as good.

The fact the game has no monthly fee is a huge plus, and probably why it wasn't another ""3 monther"". The graphics are pretty and the music is pretty good. Without more improvements this is a 2 star product.",positive
1519,"""Heroes of Might and Magic V"" is a giant step backwards for not only its previous incarnations but for strategy gaming in general.

Moves towards greater story, town, hero, troop and combat development have been completely abandoned and the game bears only a slight similarity to the Might and Magic series.

The races and their units have more in common with Kohan or Age of Wonders then they do with the Might and Magic series. The campaign game is not only linear, there are no choices to make at all! Simply solve one goal to move onto the next, often to find out that what you were doing was pointless because of a ""plot"" twist. Artifacts, wealth, generally your accomplishments in the previous campaign DO NOT carry over to the next step of the campaign. Many of the missions lack a city or army building component whatsoever and become forced marches on a board you can only get through by multiple attempts to uncover the best route.

The storyline is generic and lacks imagination. It is poorly written as well. In the opening sequence, just after the future Queen has her wedding crashed by demons she laments: ""Maybe I should have learned to fight."" In the very next scene she is in full plate mail telling her second in command that she has always been more comfortable in a battlecamp than in court. What the???

If you must have the game, why not wait a few months for the price to come down? It is simply so lackluster it does not deserve a price tag higher than $19.99.",neutral

Although most of them were enemy aircraft.

Take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games, get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue, music composers who aspire to be better than John Williams, game designers who played WAY too many Super Mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a Survival Horror game and you've got a painfully hilarious game on your hands. This game doesn't do Sega any justice and don't believe the lie that this was their first Survival Horror game, they made their first two years before this on the Saturn and that game, Deep Fear, was art compared to this. I felt absolutely lied to when I played this game thinking I was in for the scare of my life when I found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models, inconsistent soundtrack, awkward dialogue, non-existent atmosphere, incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls I've ever played on a DreamCast game. Your characters run so slow you'd think they had weights tied to their ankles, but their steps look so played out it's almost like they're waddling away from danger!

1524,"I saw the reviews, so I went ahead and bought this game, however I found myself very disappointed. I have to say that I did not really like this game, for 3 main reasons:

1. Difficulty
There were many portions of this game that were just way to difficult. As other reviewers have mentioned, many portions are impossible without memorizing the course. The only reason I made it as far as I did in this game was because I tend to be pretty patient when it comes to video games. They approach the idea of making a difficult game the wrong way. I made it to the final boss and called it quits. He had 3 attacks. One was tough to dodge, another was extremely difficult to dodge. And his other attack was impossible for me to dodge. I was pressing A to jump out of the way as fast as my reflexes would allow, and it was still too late.

2. Length of the stages
The length of the stages was generally a fair bit too long, and the checkpoints were few and far between.

3. Controls
I thought the control of DK's motion was not good. Controlling him had a slippery (think Luigi in Mario games but not quite as extreme) feel that made the already frustrating platforming even more difficult.

That said, the one thing I did like about the game was its music, which I thought was really well done. Another thing I liked was the graphical design. The stages all looked beautiful (while shouting four-letter words at the TV). Still, these could not make up for what I thought was very poorly designed Gameplay.

Do yourself a favor and have your money go towards a better platformer such as Rayman Origins, New Super Mario Bros., Rayman Legends, or New Super Mario Bros. U.",negative
1525,"Though miles better than the (awful) first game this still suffers from major bore. The free-roaming gameplay would be great if there were a bit more variety and things to do.
The main problem is that the gaming area is absolutely immense. While this may be a good thing (a whole state is your gaming area in the upcoming GTA: San Andreas) there are very few definitive landmarks to give you some kind of orientation. It's based on the real New York, with all the famous buildings, but literally hundreds of streets look the same and it's very, very easy to get hopelessly lost. Plus the only method of travel is swinging. Yes, it's cool, but very slow considering the area you have to cover and not to easy to control unless your a genius with the control pad.
And the missions are all the same. Stop an armoured car hijack, stop a guy stealing a car, save some idiot hanging off a building, beating up nameless thugs, save some guy hanging off a building, stop some guy stealing a car, save some guy hanging off a building...boring. When you complete a mission that should be it done for the whole game, none of this again and again and again trash. The average score for completing these missions is 250 hero points...you need 1, 000, 000 to reach Doc Ock at the end of the game. Sorry I ain't sticking around long enough to 4000 tedious missions.

The controls were clunky and buttons were placed in bad spots and the weapons had to be cycled through rather than set to hotkey buttons; the graphics were good but not great; and the levels all had some switch you'd have to pull somewhere in the level to open one of the thousands of locked doors.

1532,"It seems every year that another Tony Hawk game rolls around that isn't really all that different from the one that came out the year before.  And here we are, holiday time, and another Tony Hawk game.  Tony Hawk's Project 8 is about what you'd expect from the long running skateboarding series: lots of skaters, comic relief, easy to pull off tricks, nicely sized skating areas, minimal loading times, and zero innovation.  The game has pretty much the same graphics and look that the past few Hawk games have had, but this time around they're getting tiresome and showing their age on the good 'ol PS2.  Not to mention that there are some noticable graphical glitches to boot.  The tricks and combos are as simple to pull off as ever, with some minimal new features thrown in that don't really change the overall gameplay.  Not to mention that many of the skating areas seem more recycled from past arenas in previous games more so now than ever, giving you a feeling of deja vu as you grind and skate around.  The soundtrack is decent enough, but this time around the comical elements are getting tired, and the ridiculous physics are growing tiresome as well.  For being the eighth game in the series, the Tony Hawk franchise is getting Madden-ized: the same game gets released year after year with no real changes or improvements.  The last time I played a Tony Hawk game that really wowed me was way back with Tony Hawk 2 and 3, and that seems like forever ago.  All in all, if you're a longtime fan of the series, you'll probably give Project 8 a look, but chances are that you'll know what you're getting here, and you'll dig it anyway.  As for Neversoft and Activision: come on now, next year give us something different and better.",positive

1535,"This is the same review as the one I posted for the standard edition of the game. I will however add that with the Collector's Edition, one of the biggest benefits you receive is the new Prothean character that is really awesome, and it would cost 10 dollars to buy the DLC without buying the CE. Other extras in this edition include essentially useless in-game weapons and a robo-dog that just walks around in the Cargo Bay. You do however get a cool little art book, a mini comic book, an N7 patch, a post card, and a cool steel case with the special edition. I figure this is worth much more than the extra 20 dollar price increase from the standard edition. Now onto the review of the game:

For those that haven't finished Mass Effect 3, the first part of my review will be spoiler free, but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game. I'll also preface this review by saying that the ME series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times, and I beat the campaign of ME1 three times while I finished the campaign of ME2 four times. I had been incredibly excited about the game, and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about EDI and the Prothean character. Even though the game is flawed, I loved pretty much 99% of the game, but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire Mass Effect experience. I was going to play the game again with my female character as I loved the voice over work of Jennifer Hale, but now I don't really want to. I was even going to start a new character in ME1 and play all three games in succession, but now it just isn't worth it.

So, let's start with the gameplay, which in the Mass Effect series is split between the RPG aspects, and the third person cover shooting battle system. ME3 definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series, and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ. I just wish there were almost more buttons on the controller for this game. It's one of the most effective uses of a controller in any shooter, where you really have so many different attacks you could use at every moment. Most of the clunkiness once again resolves around the action button being the same as the sprint and cover button. I'm not sure if it would work, but it could be interesting if the action button was instead mapped to the select button, the only one that isn't used in the game.
Now on to the RPG systems of the game, which is much improved from basic systems in ME2, for Mass Effect 3 they basically took most of what was in ME1 and stripped out the hassle of the massive inventory screen and the repetitive/annoying/time-consuming aspect of destroying/selling the multitude of useless items you received. This interesting new inventory management system works by all of the weapons having a weight, and if you go over a certain weight limit (which is dependent on your character class and certain upgrades you can choose) you can face severe power regeneration penalties. I love this idea, but it can become annoying when all of the good weapons have really high weight. It also ends up limiting the weapons you can bring along, even though I was a Vanguard that selected the increase weight capacity upgrade. There's a possible related result, where you can no longer carry any heavy weapons like in previous games, something that I always loved. Instead there are only four heavy weapons found at few certain points lying on the ground (flamethrower, rocket launcher, some Geth laser gun, and the mini-nuke) with very limited ammo. Back to the main weapons that are in this game, I loved that Bioware brought back the Role Playing elements present in ME1 guns, almost keeping the same names and level presentation. The concept is really smart, where you can purchase an upgrade up to level 5 for each weapon and each weapon add-on (that you can have two equipped on each gun). The only problems here is that I had enough money so that each time I got a new gun I promptly maxed out the upgrades, so the system wasn't as rewarding as it could have been. Also, with the level of each add-on upgrading when you find or buy a new one, while I love this, it was a little uneven where multiple times I upgraded ones I didn't use while I couldn't find the upgrades for the ones I did regularly use. This whole system could be improved with a few adjustments, which is possibly a higher level cut-off limit like in Multiplayer (could make it so that weapons that you like don't become useless because of their stats later in the game) and something that I liked in the first game but disappeared in the sequels. That is a weapon efficiency upgrade system where you could get experience points for every enemy you kill with each weapon type, I think this could really increase the RPG feel while keeping all of the action. One more thing with the weapons, there's an interesting section of the Spectre offices where you have a fire range to test your weapon load-out. I love this idea, especially with all of the different weapons, but it makes no sense to have it on the Citadel, instead it should be in the Normandy Cargo Bay. Too many times I would upgrade a new weapon only to find I didn't like the way it fired. Then there are weapons that I never tried out as their weight was really high and the stats weren't the best. So while I may have possibly liked the way they fired, now I'll never know as I didn't have an opportunity to test them out.
I was pretty disappointed that no real changes (non-cosmetic) were made to the armor system. It's much too basic, almost exactly the same as ME2, and I wish there were more options to alter and upgrade your armor. I really kept the same armor for most of the game, even later I just made a few adjustments and all I cared about was getting the bonus percentages I wanted. The armor also looked all pretty similar, except for the helmets, which were mostly pretty goofy looking. Finally, for the different character classes, in this iteration they seem about the same, but some new abilities have been added. One of them that I really loved was the new Nova attack which was really useful when combined with the Biotic Charge, also I like that it's not perfect as it uses up your shields, creating an interesting cost versus benefit play choice.

The next aspect of the game is one that has really defined to series up to this point, and that is the conversation system of ME3. I was very disappointed that the conversation options were much more limited in this iteration, where you basically only had the paragon or renegade choice. There was never a paragade response or something else like the sarcastic comments I loved making in Dragon Age 2, at this point in the series it felt like a step back. There was also an annoying amount of conversations that resembled your talks with the DLC characters Massani and Goto. I didn't mind this too much, but it was frustrating when multiple times I would accidently hit the A button one too many times and I would skip the conversation. I also had a few graphics glitches during the normal conversations with choices, where the character's framework was broken or glitched, and they'd be looking all over the place or the eyes would be tracking wrong, it was just really weird. Even stranger, this tended to happen earlier in the game (they either occurred with Liara or Ravik), I didn't really experience it too much later, I'm not sure why. Possibly relating to this, I didn't have any problems importing my character's face as some have, but I think that's because I played around with it in ME2 because I didn't love my Shepard's face.
There were multiple times in conversations where there were great little inside joke comments that were only for my Shepard, but I was a little disappointed that there weren't more new in depth conversations with your crew. Even with the new character Vega, while I love the sparring match/conversation you had with him (One of my favorite crew member interactions in the whole series) you don't get to know him as much as you did the previous game's characters. I understand that with the possibility of almost every old character not being present in ME3, the developer didn't want to spend too much time and money on them, but conversely they didn't add many new characters. In total, not counting the DLC character, there are only four new crew members on the Normandy (all of whom are humans): the new playable jock character, a gay male pilot, a gay female communications officer, and a female reporter. I liked all of these new characters (though the reporter is a little generic and annoying) but consider something for a minute. If Garrus and Tali had died in your playthrough of ME2, for most of the game you would only have two playable characters, Vega and Liara. Later of course, you get Kaidan/Ashley and EDI, but it's amazing they didn't add new characters or make more of the characters from ME2 crew members. Even with all of the crew members possible, you don't get a representative from the Krogans and the Salarians, or any of the other non-council races. I expected to see all of the different species send someone onto the Normandy, but for some reason no one did. All we got was a Krogan leader (Wrex!), a Turian leader, and a Quarian leader in the War Room for a few missions. You'd think that if Bioware didn't want to waste time and money on possibly unpopular characters, they would have created more characters that every player would get to know. The only possible explanation for why they didn't do this is that they didn't think they had the time to establish multiple new interesting characters.
Another annoying change to something I loved before, was how when you're in the hub-world listening to people's interesting conversations you have to leave the area and come back to hear the next part of the story. In ME2, you could just keep hitting the A button to listen to the rest of the conversation, which to me worked really well. This time, even though the stories are cool, I would lose interest in them as so much time could pass between each part of the telling, also at one point they glitched out and all of the conversations reset. I also had a problem that I figure has to be a glitch where at the last conversation with the Illusive Man, the Paragon and Renegade options were greyed out. With this Shepard I have always selected the blue conversation options in each Mass Effect game every time they appeared, and I also always explore every possible conversation option. I had off the charts amounts of Reputation and Paragon points and still I had a conversation option blocked, the first time this has ever happened to me (in the Mass Effect series and every other video game with a similar conversation system). I felt extremely confused and annoyed that somehow the best possible resolution to the Illusive Man conflict wasn't available to me for no apparent reason.

 Onto the locations and exploration of the different worlds, something that was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, but is almost non-existent in ME3. Here is where ME3 strikingly reminds me of the failure of Dragon Age 2. Similarly to Kirkwall, the Citadel acts as the only hub-world in the entire Mass Effect 3 game, while in ME2 there were four completely different hub-worlds. This would be okay, as most worlds are under attack from the Reapers, except for the fact that this version of the Citadel is the smallest and most basic of the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Then the Citadel only goes through a very minor cosmetic change halfway through the game, and they expect us, a society full of ADHD people, not to grow bored of the surroundings. We get to go to worlds we've always wanted to explore, like the Turian, Salarian, Quarian, Asari and Human home-worlds, but all of them are filled with waist high walls and they're all being blown up by Reapers and/or attacked by Cerberus. The missions are also relatively short, and we fail to really see anything unique about the planets. Further, ME3 has essentially eliminated the mini missions on random worlds, and the probe mechanic found in ME2. Instead, now you have to fly around each system evading the Reapers while you randomly scan for 2 or 3 of the interesting things, which are either small amounts of fuel or some random unexplained war asset on a planet. Then you get to play a few basic solo N7 missions on the limited number of Multiplayer maps. I understand that exploring Alien worlds isn't a priority in the middle of a war with a group of ancient synthetic/organic hybrid monster spaceships, but I missed this aspect that was hugely present in the previous games.

 Related to the locations and explorations, I'm going to talk a little bit about the further development of the alien species you encounter. Sadly, we see very little new aspects of the previously introduced alien species, and no new aliens. One thing we do see is our first Krogan female, who is a very cool character, though the time spent with her is short. Also, you don't see too much of the Krogan woman, but this kind of makes sense when you consider the Krogan society. Once again, every other species' females are non-existent, I guess Bioware believes the Asari provide enough females for everyone. Also, I can explain away why we don't see many of the other races' females (though we probably should see them as refugees or scientists), but I find it weird that we don't see any Turian females. From Garrus' previous stories, it has been established that females can serve in their military and can compete with the best of the males (also they're apparently very flexible but don't have much reach). The one new design that Bioware were extremely successful in creating was that of the Prothean. They succeeded in looking like the Collectors and were just extremely cool. I loved even more the reality of what their culture was in comparison to what everyone had believed. The only problem is that for some reason Bioware decided to make this important and awesome character first-day DLC.  Finally, the worst aspects of the new alien design in ME3 are the Quarians.
I either wanted Bioware to keep the Quarians faces secret, or I wanted a beautiful scene to show off Tali's true face, they even had the perfect situation when they are on her home planet of Rannoch. Instead Bioware was lazy, and they just had Tali give a picture to Shepard that he could keep in his cabin. This picture showed a poorly photo-shopped stock photo of a cute human woman that probably took an hour or two to make. Every single piece of Tali fan art I've seen is a hundred times better than what Bioware chose. Since Turians and Quarians are so closely related (same amino acid structure) then they would probably look more similar to each other instead of being human (except for some tattoos and different hands). Of course, they would be also be different in many ways (the Turian world experienced a lot of radiation which caused them to develop the armor plates) and there was something about the Quarians where they have a symbiosis with the plant life on their world, and because of this their immune systems weren't fully developed (this was then made worse by years and years spent on sterile space ships). Even if Bioware wanted a mostly human design to appease Tali fans (which there is some precedent for as the eyes and nose appear human behind the mask) I've seen much better humanoid designs for Tali. I mean it's a little strange where fans are more talented and spend more time creating images of a very important design than the official developer.

 Here's where I'm going to stick a bunch of the random features in the game. I was a bit surprised by the complete elimination of mini-games in ME3, while they were all a little annoying before, instead of fixing them now they just removed them, and the doors/safes take a little longer to open, implying that you're automatically performing some type of hack or bypass. The reputation system is a much appreciated addition/adaptation, where you get standard reputation points for performing moral neutral actions, and every Paragon or Renegade point adds to your total. Because of this, players are no longer punished from not being an absolute character, and no matter you preference if you have enough reputation points both of the Paragon and Renegade conversation choices are unlocked. However, it is pretty goofy how the bar is filled up very early into the game, I was still getting lots of points, but there was no visual interpretation of the increase. I almost wish there was a bigger bar, or even a numerical presentation of all of your reputation points. Another new addition to this game is the War Assets and Effective Military Strength (EMS). I really liked this feature, as everything you've done in the Mass Effect series is represented here. However, once again the bar fills up incredibly early in the game. There's also some really disturbing about the EMS, and that's the aspect of Galactic Readiness, which can only be increased by playing multiplayer. So if you hate Co-op Multiplayer, or if you don't have enough money or the ability to have an Xbox Live Gold Membership, your Galactic Readiness is locked at 50%. This means that all of your War Assets will be halved for the EMF. So let's look at my level, I had 7245 points with a Galactic Readiness hovering around 100%. If I wouldn't have played Multiplayer, then I would have only had 3622 EMF points, which is enough to get the endings but is not enough to get the ""best"" ending. To put this in perspective, I played every mission available except for a few that glitched out on me. The only things that might have lowered my war assets, were that in ME1 I saved the Council, in ME2 I destroyed the Collector Base (even though for the story Cerberus still found most of it intact), and in ME3 I cured the Krogan Genophage which annoyed the Salarians. One other random thing, in ME3 you don't have someone like Kelly that will take care of your fish. The only option is to buy a crazy expensive Aquarium VI, and if you don't your fish will die, even if you feed them every chance you get. You'd think EDI would be able to monitor your fish tank for free, but I guess it'd be a little degrading considering her new role as a crew member on herself.

 Now onto the last aspect of the game that isn't the story, and that is the newly added Co-op Multiplayer. I was initially concerned about this aspect of the game, but I've had a lot of fun playing with it. I did have a lot of problems with the EA servers the first couple of days though, and this was exasperated by the fact that you only get experience and credits by either successfully completing the mission, or by dying. I wish that the game would save your experience after each wave, especially when any expendable items you use before you disconnect are lost forever. After this I also glitched out a couple times, once I got stuck in a wall, but I was actually still able to kill a bunch of the enemies while some of them were unable to get me. Another time I glitched out during multiplayer, it was much worse and much weirder, where the whole stage was shaking like I was in the middle of an earthquake. Then while I was running, I ended up floating in the air for a few feet before falling through the floor (I actually have a video of it but it's kind of crappy since I couldn't find my camera and used my iPod). Sadly or thankfully, my team members were a capable bunch (even though it was a silver Reaper mission) and were able to beat the 10 waves, though it took like 20 minutes where I just had to float there in nothingness and wait. The even weirder thing was that I could damage some of the enemies with biotic powers, and the enemies were able to kill me. However, once I died I would immediately come back to life. Looking past the glitches, I love leveling up the different characters, and with a group of capable players the missions can be very fun. However, after a while I grew a little bored playing the missions, they're all just too similar. Then I worked really hard on maxing out the Vanguard branch, but when I hit level 20, to get the achievement I promoted the soldiers. This is a cool idea, but I wish there was more of a reward for this, or possibly the ability to still use the high level characters when attempting a Gold level mission, or at the very least a new character plus where they get an extra bonus so you're not starting from the very beginning of the character. The biggest problem I have with the multiplayer though is that EA decided to for the first time in a AAA console game to include a freemium pricing structure for the locked characters, weapons and items. I actually find this kind of offensive, as I could play the multiplayer for hours and get a random pack someone else could get immediately by shilling out two dollars. I especially have a problem with this pricing as you could spend two dollars on a pack, and get nothing you could use. If you're going to charge for items others could get by just playing the game, I think you should be able to pick items, although of course it would make it even more unfair for people that don't want to be tricked into paying for items that are already in the game. I think that the Multiplayer could be saved with a patch, and possibly more game modes than the 10 waves that always feature the play modes capture the flag, secure the base, head-hunt certain enemies, and kill everything moving. As it currently stands, I can't see this multiplayer establishing a consistent faithful base for anything nearing long term.

 Now, I can finally get to the aspect of the game that had me the most upset/frustrated, and that is the story. From here on in, warning, there be major spoilers ahead. Right from the start of the game the story is goofy. A minute after our first look at the ME universe's Earth, the Reapers attack, not giving the player any time to acclimate to the game. Then a little later (after a goofy child's death that will haunt Shepard for the rest of the game) you are introduced to the game's one and only plot device, blueprints for an all-powerful weapon designed but not completed by the Protheans, called the Crucible. This is just so generic and out of the blue, it doesn't make any sense, but I was ok with playing along. You then have a mission involving each of the previous ME game's characters, some small and some large. The developers then proceed to kill off two of my favorite characters in these missions, Mordin and Thane. However, I can accept their deaths, especially since it was established previously that both of them were near death (old age and lung disease respectively) and both of them were done very well, they had good deaths. I admit that I felt serious emotion with both of them, and I may or may not have cried through the whole hospital scene.
I have a lot of problems with the development of Cerberus as the main antagonist in a game about the Reapers. I understand that Bioware wanted to provide different enemies to face, and I admit that their AI and designs are excellent. However, I don't understand how Cerberus became so powerful. Every time you see them they're a step ahead of you, even when you kill hundreds or thousands of their heavily armed and trained troops. Later they kind of explain this by establishing that they created a refugee Sanctuary that was actually a Human harvesting and indoctrination factory, but it still doesn't quite add up. I didn't love Cerberus in ME2, and things they've done had always been on the border of indecency and terrorism, but it usually seemed to be in Humanity's best interest. However, in ME3 they're all crazy and doing absolutely horrible incomprehensible things, Bioware tries to say it's all because TIM has been slowly indoctrinated and he's now under control of the Reapers, but I never really thought they successfully established this. Probably the goofiest Cerberus plot line is the coup of the Citadel, which made absolutely zero sense. They somehow gained control of Udina (who while being a douche bag didn't have any connections to Cerberus and had no reason to betray the rest of the Council) and managed to infiltrate the Citadel which is supposed to be the safest and most guarded place in the Galaxy (they even again said they upgraded the security). Then they for some reason wanted to assassinate the entire council, for reasons that are never explained.
 Up until around halfway through the game, I didn't love the story, but I was in love with the game and having a lot of fun playing it. I mean the actual story for ME2 was pretty basic and goofy, but I still absolutely loved the game. Then, after the previously mentioned Cerberus coup of the Citadel, I received the first realization that Bioware might not care about their fans, or that they might possibly even hate us. Previously in the Citadel, you met up and talked to Kelly Chambers in the refugee camp. There was a great little scene where after asking if she wants to rejoin the Normandy, she describes the horror she experienced on the Collector ship, and that she can't be on the Normandy as it reminds her of what she faced. Instead, she's helping the refugees coming into the Citadel. I loved this little interaction, and I thought it was great fan service for people that liked Kelly. Then after the coup, when walking around the refugee camp you hear two people talking and they basically say ""Have you seen that red headed woman who was helping out so much?"" ""You didn't hear? A Cerberus soldier came up asking if she was Kelly Chambers, and after she said yes he just shot her in the head."" ""Huh, I guess if Cerberus asks you if you're someone, you should just say no."" ""Hah hah hah.""  This was a character I spent the whole of ME2 talking to and growing to care about, and Bioware decided to kill her off so disrespectfully and unnecessarily, I was just absolutely horrified. I wished I could have never heard that conversation, but no, it will now always be in my brain.
 After this point, everything was ok, not perfect but I pretty much enjoyed all of the events and there were some truly awesome kickass scenes (I loved the fight where you called on the mother of all Thresher Maws and the brokering of peace between the Quarians and Geth), until the final battle to retake Earth. The whole strategy for retaking Earth was a little goofy, but I didn't mind it too much. There was also a great area where before the final battle you walk around the camp and talk to all of your party members, and you can even call and talk to the previous game's characters that aren't playable in ME3. The conversations are a little short, but I enjoyed all of them. Then after fighting for a while, you get to the beam to take you to the Citadel (Which was overtaken by the Reapers without any explanation of how & you can assume billions of people were killed) and everything breaks apart in a million pieces. You know the developer did something wrong when fan created explanations/interpretations make more sense than what we were actually given (The most logical being that the whole Citadel sequence was an indoctrinated dream). Other people have more succinctly examined and explained all of the different problems and plot holes, so I won't go too in depth here. Nevertheless, you are apparently hit by the Reaper's laser beam that destroys everything it touches, but here you only get some melted armor and a beat up face. You also receive a very powerful heavy pistol with unlimited ammo that you use to kill the Reaper creations between you and the teleportation beam. When you get to the beam and are transported to the Citadel, somehow both the Illusive Man and Anderson beat you to the main room. There's this whole thing where somehow TIM is able to control your body and make you shoot Anderson, but you are able to break control and kill TIM.
After ascending the elevator to the merged Crucible and Citadel console, a God-like AI in the form of the dead child from Earth appears. Here, Bioware for some reason decides to give you more questions instead of providing the player with any answers. The God-child says that the Reapers are his answer to the problem that Synthetic life (pure order) will eventually completely wipe out all Organic life (pure chaos). Basically, the Reapers were created to save Organic life from Synthetics by murdering and harvesting every developed race each 50,000 years (A synthetic being created hybrids to kill organics to save them from being killed by synthetics). Through this whole interaction, Shepard acts completely subjugated and accepts everything the child says as absolute truth. You are finally given three options, you can control the Reapers (presented as the blue or Paragon choice even though it was represented by TIM, who was at least a Renegade character), you could destroy the Reapers along with all synthetic life (presented as the red or Renegade choice even though it was represented by Anderson, who was absolutely a Paragon character), or you could take the third option which would merge all organic and synthetic life (presented by no one, but this is obviously the choice that the God-child AI wants). Then, no matter what choice you make, as long as your war assets are beyond a very small level, Shepard dies, the Reapers leave Earth or are destroyed, every Mass Relay is destroyed (hopefully in a way different than what was seen in the Arrival DLC or entire systems might have been wiped out of existence), and the Normandy (After Joker apparently flees the battle on Earth) just barely escapes the blast and crash lands on an Eden-like planet, with characters that were just with you rushing the beam somehow being magically transported to the Normandy.
Then that's it, the game is over except for a ridiculous conversation featuring a star-child and an old man taking place in a forest that resembles the one in Shepard's dream (and a flash of Shepard taking a breath if you had enough EMS and chose to destroy the Reapers). Oh, also there's an insulting message telling you to buy the future DLC Bioware releases, and you're set up back on the Normandy before the raid on the Cerberus base. I literally walked all around the Normandy trying to talk to everyone, and it felt like I was in a different dimension, it was just so weird and awkward. The only real difference between the three endings is the color of the beam the Crucible emits and the explosion that follows. When faced with the choice, I watched each ending on Youtube, and decided on the Green/Synthesis ending. Partly because it was the weirdest, but mostly because Edi and Joker embrace in that end, and if I had to die & the universe had to be irreversibly changed (most likely leading to many of the stranded races on Earth dying of starvation and never seeing their homes or loved ones) at least someone could find some happiness in this ending.

 So why am I and almost every Mass Effect fan outraged at the ending""s"" Bioware gave us? (In one poll found on the official Mass Effect forums 91% of around 60,000 fans hated the ending and wants Bioware to change it completely, and 6% still wanted the ending slightly adjusted). First and foremost, the ending is so bleak and depressing, that there is no opportunity for happiness or even a sense of accomplishment that should come with beating a video game. I've never before played a game that punished me for beating it. Then there are so many plot holes with weird and abrupt revelations that make no sense. However, the biggest problem with the ending is that no choice that you made in all three games has any bearing on the outcome. As long as your Shepard didn't die in ME2 and you have the minimum amount of war assets or EMS in ME3 you get the same ending as someone that worked hard in each Mass Effect game and created their perfect Shepard story, maxing out all of the meters, doing all of the missions. I wouldn't have liked any ending where Shepard dies, but I could have accepted it if it was well done and provided closure, instead of just appearing to be the crumpled pieces of paper that a writer with any talent would have thrown into the trash.
The prevailing sense of hopelessness despair and depression was never before found in the Mass Effect games. Even though you faced suicide missions, if you did everything right only one of your",positive
1536,"Originally reviewed by me at somnambulant-gamer.com:

Normally I'm the kind of person who, if I don't have anything positive to say about a game, just doesn't say anything. It's not really worth my time to write about a game I don't care about, right? But Final Fantasy Type-0 is terrible, and I really feel it's only fair to let you know. This game was actually so bad, I had to wait a day to write about it, because yesterday afternoon I actually wanted to title this post ""Type 0: a crappy game from crappy people who want you to waste your money on crappy things"". My grumpiness was compounded somewhat by the fact that all the big review sites like IGN and Gamespot were giving this game glowing reviews that it frankly didn't deserve, which led to me wasting money. Okay, enough venting, let me get into this.

The game starts out with a cinematic that was probably only 15 to 20 minutes long, but felt like 3 hours. It was atrocious, disjointed, and fully 3/4 of the cinematic is spent on the tragic death of a character I can only assume you're supposed to care about, because you have absolutely no idea who he is at this point. The graphics look to be polished versions of something you might expect to see on a hand-held device that's a generation or two out of date (because they are), which isn't too terrible, except in a few instances where you've got characters with highly detailed faces and wafting individual strands of hair who still have blocky shovel hands reminiscent of World of Warcraft characters prior to the Warlords of Draenor update. Apparently, the game is about 4 countries (that maybe have crystals?) that are represented by signature beasts: a white tiger, an azure dragon, a red phoenix, and a black tortoise. Fans of the franchise will recognize the references to (and overt appearances of) staples such as the Bahamut and Phoenix eidolons. The country with the tigers has magitek machines, and apparently they go to war against the country with the phoenix, which for reasons inadequately explained until many, many hours later leads them to attack the stronghold of the country with the azure dragon.

You're dropped into this war as three kids who just saw another kid (presumably one of their number based on the uniform and pretty much nothing else at this point) die after struggling to find them (with no other apparent purpose) and apparently being too wounded to be healed by magic despite the fact that it takes him fully ten freaking minutes of cinematics after the attempt to finally kick the bucket, at which point his chocobo (big two-legged riding bird, staple of the franchise), who's seemed dead for about eight of those ten minutes, gives a mournful cry in a blatantly manipulative attempt to evoke an emotion the game hasn't earned. Then you get to spend about an hour and some change running through the city being subjected to some of the most boring and uninspired combat and maps you've seen in the last decade. The combat itself is brutally disappointing, reminiscent of the repetitive slogs seen in games like Devil May Cry where you hack and slash your way through dozens of faceless mooks over and over, without the inspired combo systems and flashy design that made that game a success. There's lots of small issues interspersed through the combat system as well, including clunky targeting with a mind of its own, frequent (if fairly short) load times, and one of my personal pet peeves - camera angles that are a greater hindrance to your party's advancement than the actual enemies.

You get to control three (of an eventual fourteen) characters during this section, a character who uses magical cards to attack and perform other maneuvers (a cool and almost successful call-back to fan-favorites of the franchise like Setzer in Final Fantasy III / VI), one who uses a spear and a jump attack (the ""dragoon""), and a character who fights with a chinese longsword. Each character has all of four combat options available at this point, a standard attack, their special trick (card shuffling, jumping, and an AoE aura effect), one spell of a given element, and their defensive option. The combat has been compared to Crisis Core by several sites, but I really feel that does a disservice to Crisis Core, which had a robust combat interface that flowed seamlessly between the combat and exploration phases and utilized a highly customizable materia system that was actually pretty advanced for its time.

I feel like I have to find some redeeming quality in the game at this point... Okay, there's two things. The first, is that the cinematics, while climactically disjointed and painfully, brutally boring, go to places that are out of the norm for the franchise, in a good way. You'll see Square-Enix referring to this game as a ""more mature"" entry. While the actual story-line is about as mature as a twelve year writing his first piece of fan fiction, what this is really referencing is the fact that in this war-time environment, we actually see spurts of blood when someone is shot or stabbed, soldiers ruthlessly gunning down or bayoneting enemy wizards and civilians, etc. If some real character and story development had been married to a cohesive plotline and a modern combat interface, this could have been an amazing step for the Final Fantasy franchise, whose original fans are now at an age where they have kids, or even grandkids, of their own.

The second redeeming quality is that the game comes with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XV, an actual next-gen game set in the same world. Final Fantasy XV seems to be set to offer many of the things this game lacks: strong character development, a cohesive story, true next-gen graphics, and a robust combat system. While obviously still in the developmental stage, this fledgling game helped to restore some of the faith and hope that the actual game it was packaged with sucked out of me like some kind of vampiric leech that feeds on joy and nostalgia. Unfortunately, at the end of the day Type-0 isn't really a game; it's an advertisement for the actual game that they expect you to pay $60 for.",negative

1538,"To give some background of me and the the games I play, I'm a 19 year old sophomore in college that plays 3DS games casually during long gaps between classes. I love the main Pokemon series of games, the Etrian Odyssey series, Bravely Default, and I thought Fire Emblem: Awakening was a masterpiece. Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop distance and Monster Hunter 3 were so-so for me. I won't review Conception II here as you can get a much better review elsewhere but if you have similar interests as me you might want to look thoroughly into reviews before getting this game as I didn't enjoy it too much. It felt very unorganized, and is probably more suited for very younger audiences although it does have many of what can be interpreted as sexual innuendos in place of real comedy which made me want to repeatedly bang my head against the table. I also got this when it came out with the pre-order soundtrack (yes this is a very late review, I've been busy) and I thought it was pretty bland. I had really high hopes for this game, I usually love all of Atlus' games (I know they only published Conception II and didn't actually make it).",positive

1543,"So, I bought this game since it had a lot of hypes while getting a dunkin donut coffee.  So, after playing for 1 hour..I felt this is so repetitive and boring.  Here are what I found to be negative

1) Linearity
It's just one mission after another w/ lots of left-click, left-click, and occational right-click.  In many places, there's a little dungeon you can go but u can easily explore that in 1 minute and move on.  Just after Act 2.. I didn't really have any inspiration to move on

2) Too much items / stupid coin chase
After playing just 1 hour..and I had to sell bunch a crap to clear out the inventory.  Just seemed more annoying.  Also, coin chase is so dumb.. is this a Mario game? just give me gold after a kill or something.  Destroying a barrel or rock and getting a gold seems really stupid.  Really? Also, after selling 50 items..you can only afford 1 weapon items.. yeah.. something isn't right here.  I never had to buy anything from shop as I'll find something better in next 10 minute of playing.

3) Graphics
Many say better graphic than Diablo 2.  First, it's sad to compare graphics with a game that's older then 10 years... Do you really want to compare graphics between SNES and PS3? really? Let's face it.. graphic is just ok~ nothing great.

4) Music
hm... all is forgettable

5) cut scene
It was definitely different and possibly best part of the game.

Anyways... I'll eventually finish the game w/ at least one class since I already paid for this boring game.....",positive
1544,"So we all know by now the limitless amount of fun SvsR08 was... well the new hype was that 09 was going to get rid of that rock, paper, scissors thing and let you be in control where you want and how you want.

However after a few minutes of playing, you realize it still needs a lot of work, and I mean A LOT!

First off, before even putting the game in the DS, the instruction booklet is of no use to you what so ever. I want you to think for a couple of seconds about what you would expect to find in an instruction booklet... (jeopardy music).... now, you probably would have guessed INSTRUCTIONS for $500.... *buzzer* there are no instructions to be found in it!!! The first two pages are the usual warning stuff, then it shows a couple of pictures and some long rant about tag teams and what THQ planned to do with this game. It's made by THQ, why does it sound like it's a preview article from some magazine? There is nothing in it but some dumb rant for 15 pages saying this game is going to rock.... WTF?

So onto the game. First thing I went to was the create a player... and it's pretty disappointing... sure it's the first of it's kind on a DS system, but it has so very little to chose from.... 4 body types, one ripped, semi ripped, not muscly and skinny as ric flair if he had anorexia.... you will not find body types for fat or female. But you can choose whatever skin color you want, as we just can not live without making a hulk hogan mod with green skin to actually look like the hulk.

The rest of the clothing is fairly limitless, you can make a char that resembles what you want, but don't expect to find much there you think is cool, whoever thought bunny ears and a clown nose would be a great inclusion needs to be locked in a sharpshooter for a month.

Moves are pretty limitless to. You can only have 2 weak grapple, two strong grapple, same for reverse positions, a ground hit, a ground move blah blah blah.... thats not enough... I was SO bored stupid trying to go through season mode with an array of 10 moves to repeat over and over and over again, you find yourself constantly quitting season mode to change your custom wrestlers moves to keep some sort of interest going in the game. (doing that won't effect your season)

Also, the limited selection of moves... unlike the other THQ create a wrassler modes, this one doesnt have a selection for weak and strong grapples, it has one lot to select for either, so you could have a weak grapple tombstone piledriver and a strong grapple arm lock... but whats even dumber, the moves you can select are only of that who is in this game. there is 21 wrestlers in this game or something like that, meaning there is only 21 finishers you can select from.... don't look for a Stunner, Rock Bottom, Mandible Claw, Atomic Leg Drop, Figure 4 Leg Lock... there not in this game!
Music and entrance is the same, but they did add 1, and i repeat 1 song that is custom, and it's not worth using.

So... onto game play now.
The graphics are much the same as 08, only the entrances are now included and look pretty good for a DS game. And there is pretty much every arena to choose from (ppv's ect) and each look ok... but you pretty much only see them during the entrance, as every match is an angle in the ring where you can see the ramp but thats it.... and don't look for backstage areas, you can't get to them during matches... what you see in previews is one of 4 areas you visit.... which is annoying, i'll tell you why.... in 08 you went from area to area to either look for an opponent, an office, look for items or to train.... it's not that much of an improvement here.... you start in your house, where you live i guess, and in the room you have a bed, which you have to go to sleep to get to next week, a computer to either save your game or shop for useless items.... a coffee table with magazines to check your progress, who is champ and who you have beaten as well as a checklist of opponents you took on, and your records of win and loss... there is also a cubboard to select items that might give you a bit of a boost in your stats which is a waste of time as you can have all the stats as high as you want, the only one decent to have is submissions so it doesnt take as long to make an opponent tap out.

Then there is wwe headquarters, you go there to talk to vince, or one of the GM's when they call you. Then there is the gym to work out in 3 ways, work on your head using a stupid mini game to lift dumbbells by following a curser on the screen with your stylus stick.... a weight lifting game where you blow into the mic ... and yes, it blows... and another where you have to keep lifting little falling bars back to the top of a box to do the last one.... annoying because you can only do one training thing per week, if you could do it constantly one after the other it might have been ok, but it's annoying having to play home>>gym>>match every time you play... win your match and then your home again to repeat it over and over and over and over and over again.

The matches themselves are a different play then 08, but it still needs so much more work. Using the direction pad and the stylus at the same time just feels awkward. You can get used to it, but why the heck did they bother to incorporate the stylus? It would be so much easier to just use the buttons like the other console versions.

It's also annoying that half the time you get out done by the computer if you try to beat them by doing grapple moves, as the computer usually comes out on top if you screw up or are not fast enough drawing annoying circles on the screen.

And it has those cheap strategies you revert to... like knocking them down and using submissions till you win, or what i find myself doing a lot is going outside the ring, knock your opponent down at the 7 count and get back in the ring for them to be counted out, works 95% of the time... and is cheap but too effective.

So it may not be the same game play and style as the 08 version, but it still is very limited and needs so much, so much, SO MUCH work done to improve this game for DS.

Season mode is boring, too. I already said what I said about the repetitiveness of the game, but the awards and achievements in the game give you no satisfaction at all. A still shot of some diva bimbo smiling and a message saying, ""wwe champion"" is a kick in the teeth to anyone expecting something just a little bit better then a still image... it's like a prettied up version of a NES game that said, ""congratulations, thanks for playing, hope you enjoyed working your tush off for days in order to read this message""

I have not had this game a week yet, and already I have lost the urge to play it again. I just don't care to complete season mode to find out what happens in the end... even if I can find codes that work for it, or action replay cheats... I still don't think anything could make this game any better to me.

I'm not so disappointed int he price of the game, as I got mine for a bargain on ebay, but I would say that if you pay more then 10 for this, your being ripped off.

There are a lot of people out there still waiting to know how this game plays before trying it... all I can say is, don't kick yourself if you have to wait 10 years to find one for 50 cents at a pawn shop, you will not have missed out on a game you must try before you die. It may have a so called ""improved"" style of playing, but it's far from fun.

The in game sound of the crowed is barley there, they only make a sound when you are ready to do a finisher, they don't chant, the game play is stale, the controls are annoying, there is no charisma or fun to the game play, and is in bad need of commentary as the matches get more boring then the last watching to decent looking chars play like absolute stiff drones.",negative

1548,"I've played for about 5 hours, most of that in the Character Creator and hating the experience.  I'm the type of person that loves the character editor and can spend a stupid amount of time in it, making new characters I might not even play as. And the character editor is horrible, now before release Bioware kept saying that it would be like Dragon Age Inquisition, One of the best editors on the market.  So i was super pumped just to play around with that... and what it turns out to be is 9 preset face of each gender that are all hideous, that you have only the slightest input in actually altering.  Mostly its just their eye position, and nose size, not type of eye shape, mouth shape or nose shape.

They are designed this way so you (a twin) can have your twin and father look like you are in the same family racially, but there is nothing stopping you from making one twin Asian and the other twin black.  which is what i did in my game, and the father (which is generated based on your main character profile I think) came out kind of middle eastern looking.  neat effect?  But why is it locked within the preset profiles to make such a boring effect. Without giving away a spoiler it literally doesn't matter after a hour into the game that your character looks like your father.  Cause lets just say, they tend to wear helmets a lot and bad things happen.

Furthermore, each preset has a definite age, skin texture, eye shape, nose shape, and coloring that comes along with that preset that can't be changed at all.  and I'm not taking about skin tone, one girl has a red pointy turned up nose, like shes perpetually a little drunk (or British).  One woman looks like she's 50, deep lines on her face.  One of the man looks like he's never evolved past being a neanderthal, and none of this can be changed at all.  Not at all, point red nose girl will always have a pointy red nose, old lady will always be old, young man with freckles will always be the only one of his kind with freckles, the placement, and sizer of eyes, nose, and chin are the only thing you can change.  It is literally the most disappointing part of the whole thing.

Hair for whatever reason is locked to each gender, also with about 9 presets each gender and seems to be a wig rather then actually come out of the character head. also the hair color is the same as the facial hair color though the eye brows never changed.  In past games all of these were individually controllable, cause blonde beards always look like someone put shaving cream on and forgot to shave in these games.

The only thing that seems to have any controllable is the make up color and and tattoo color, which is on a slider.  Considering I'm terrible at putting on make up in the first place, I gave up and made my dude look like a very fabulous drag queen and the girl like she's from an old 80's metal band.

Now when it comes to gameplay, again I've played up till the first main plot point, I can't say much other then... it took 600 years in cryosleep to get there how are the surprised aliens got there first. Seriously!  You don't have legion operating these ships to make sure their decision to go that far isn't wasted... apparently not.

Rumor has it they might update the creator with a patch, but until I'm not backlogged with better games like Horizon Zero Dawn and Nier, I'll probably wait to play it again when I have time or hopefully they Patch it.  Since the games release on Tuesday it's had 4 patches, what's a few more to make they game feel less like a beta game launch.  If i didn't get the game for 15$ i would have canceled my pre-order... still wishing i did and used the money on something better.",neutral
1549,"Now I myself personally love me some Super Mario. If you checked my reviews, you'll see that I've given&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Advance-4-Super-Mario-Bros-3/dp/B00009WAUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros 3</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-World-Super-Mario-Advance/dp/B00005UK88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance</a>&nbsp;all high ratings. When I purchased those two games, I've noticed that Nintendo made some changes with those games since the last time I've owned them on Super Nintendo. So here I am with Super Mario Advance, which is Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance, and I have to say that I've not impressed at all with this one. I understand that video games ""evolve"" over time and creaters try to make them better, but there is a difference between making the game better than the origonal, and making it complicated than the origonal. Nintendo did the latter with this game.

Changes for the good are nice for me. On this one you can pick you character each time you die (actually you could do that since the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-All-Stars/dp/B000050FBJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario All-Stars</a>&nbsp;game, and I didn't know you couldn't do that on the origonal NES game until I was playing my cousin's Wii a few days ago). Also it tells you each characters power under them on the select screen. Another helpful change is when you collect the star which makes you become invincible for a few seconds. Back then when you collect a certain amount of cherries, a star would just randomly float from the bottom of the screen. On here you'll hear some kind of tone which warns you the star is comming.

Not so good changes are very visible. First of all, what got me was during the beginning of the game, there is a long drop before you reach the bottom and start. They changed that too, which sucks. Also on the origonal game you started off big (the status you are when you have at least two hearts on the left side of the screen). Here you're small (with one heart on the left side), which really isn't a problem because you can find hearts anywhere to make you grow. Back then if you kill enough enemies, a heart will float from the ground and you gain more life. Here, hearts are inside the plants you pick up from the ground and sitting idle in high places on levels. And what really ticks me off is the red shell that you can pick up from the ground. Back then you threw the red shell at an enemie and it would have hit the wall and dissapeared. Here if you throw a shell, it will bounce off the wall and keep going, and if it hits you, you loose a heart or die (come on now!). And whats the deal with those huge Shy Guys and Turnip Plants? And like every Mario game, the characters speak (Peach doesn't know when to shut up). Hell even Birdo speaks (that purple dinosaur that shoot out eggs), and half the time I don't even knows what she is saying.

There you have it with Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance. What I believed happened was that Nintendo received feedback since 1993 when this game was reissued on SNES on how difficult the game was and tried their best to make it easier and more fun for new and younger Nintendo gamers, because I played the origonal on the Wii and it was the exact version on the NES and it was way harder. Older guys like me will definately find this game flawed if you've had it in different formats. Nintendo has made some great reissues with great modifications, but they shot a brick with this one big time. Peace.

When grabbed, health goes down but regenerates.  I will leave my original review, but changes should be acknowledged.)

Prior to this version, I actually enjoyed all the Resident Evil games even the lowly rated Operation Raccoon City. I liked the idea that it was told from Umbrella's perspective even if it was done a bit half-as*ed. While it had its shortcomings, the game was playable and at least a great rental. Even though 5 wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be (Remember that first teaser and E3 Trailer), it at least was a good action game that slightly improved on RE 4's controls. This new sequel doesn't really improve on anything. In fact, it actually feels worse. I always thought of the RE Team as pioneers who paved the way for other games, but after playing this game. I no longer feel that way at all. I feel the opposite now. As a fan from the beginning, besides Outbreak, it was the first in the series that made me literally stop playing and wonder if I will ever play another game in the series again. Here are the gripes that killed it for me.

While the story was never groundbreaking, I always found the family dynamic of it appealing about a few lone survivors trying to escape and expose this pharmaceutical corporation of its corruption. It had a lot of intrigue and mystery to it. While I liked 4 a lot, I was always disappointed that they never finished the Umbrella story off properly. From that point on, the story just became too convoluted for me to care about anything anymore. I mean the story's gone from the T-Virus, to G-Virus, T-Veronica, Las Plagas, Progenitor virus, and now C-Virus. There seems to be a serious lack of focus here. They're just making things up now. Where are the other characters and how are they doing? Remember Barry, Claire or Rebecca, anyone? Also didn't Umbrella want to kill these people for knowing and uncovering their secret? Why wasn't any of this ever explored deeper? Now the zombie outbreak is on a global scale? Yikes, they are actually copying the movies now. Word of advice to Capcom, please hire a writer or someone who actually cares about the story and characters.

The quick time events intrude too much on your gameplay to the point that now they've become mini-games themselves. I'm not sure if the developers thought this would add another element to the gameplay, but I found it really annoying. Think of it like guitar hero, but not exactly. I don't get it; RE 4 used it just fine. Quick time events should only be used sparingly not overbearingly.

While I got used to the controls, I found the game to be unplayable as a single player game. My partner is useless and slow to heal. Falling down and waiting for the meter or them to heal you was really frustrating. This was what made me turn off the game for good. When you have enemies leaping at you from all sides in a tight space with one or two herbs, this can become a real annoyance. You're better off just dying. Health doesn't regenerate, so as soon as you use that one herb and get hit again, you're going to have to repeat that whole process all over again. Why not save me the agony? When you die, you get all your health back. How you lose and gain health in this game really seems off. You can't even pause the screen to regenerate. What's the point of flicking the analog back & forth when getting grabbed if you're just going to lose health anyways? If I move it quickly enough, I should avoid losing health.

This is just a few of the many issues I had with the game, but it was those mentioned that ruined the experience for me. Playing with a friend might have made the experience better, but to me this series has always been a single player game. If I can get around the AI partner in RE 4 & 5, I should also with this game. As of this moment, I have given up and lost all hope in the franchise, which is fitting since the game's description is ""No Hope Left."" After playing Undead Nightmare and Dead Island, this game fails to compete on all levels. The competition is getting better, while the series seems to be getting worse. They added lots of content, but if the game isn't fun to play. What's the point.",positive
1555,"One word: Tedious. I didn't like this ND installment from the start. I have absolutely no interest in the Greek alphabet, history, or mythology. The setting was a snore, the characters uninteresting, and the character Niobe was shown in two places at once (a clear oversight because of a Her Interactive deadline). I miss the early Nancy Drew games. She needs to have an adventure in England or New York or even a cruise ship. No more Greek, Egyptian, or weird sheep infested locations (Shattered Medallion, anyone?). The puzzles in this game were incredibly tedious and annoying to play. I took no enjoyment in flipping back and forth through a ridiculous and loooooong script to find out how to play some of them. And there was hardly ever a real clear explanation as to how to play some of the puzzles. I had to use the hints more in this game than I ever have. Warnings at Waverly and Secret of the Old Clock are still my top favorites. There's variety and interesting characters and games. The teaser for the next one seems like it could be promising. But Iceland of all places... Instead of pre-ordering the next one I will have to wait until I see other's review of the game before plunking down my hard earned money.",negative
1556,"I've only played the first 3 boards so far.  However that's enough to know this game is worth only $..., not $....
The shooting action and killing action are fairly [bad].  When you shoot, you don't get the sense that your doing the shooting.  It feels more like your pushing a button on a controller which is activating an animated gun on your television screen.  The same is true for when you hit someone (shooting them).  When you hit a bad guy they just fall-no dust blowing off of their jackets or blood. If you played and liked Medal of Honor or the oldies like 007 goldeneye(N64)or Perfect Dark(N64), then you will be disappointed.  I consider realistic gunshots(a sense of recoil and power coupled with good sound effects) to be the most important element of a good 1st person shooter, if that [is bad] then there is not much worth playing for.
Otherwise the graphics were just OK.  Nothing to right home about.  Controls were decent, learning curve pretty short (10min).
Overall this game brings nothing new to 1st person shooters.  It would have been better if released in May 1995.  If your thinking about buying this I would definately rent it first or just dig out Goldeneye from your archives.
I'm assuming the PC version is a whole lot beter because I keep seeing rave reviews for the PC.  If you play this on PS2 and are raving then I would guess your only about 10 or 12 years old and never played the games mentioned above before.",neutral
1557,These are comfortable but when you get involved in a game they tend to roll right off the joystick. I would rather play without them so that I don't waste time trying to put them back on all the time.,neutral
1558,"I love the game but the lack of the Japanese dub was a huge disappointment because I been listening the story the whole time in Japanese.
Its like I'm reading a book that sudden changed from English to Spanish, while I do understand the meaning, the sudden change bugs the hell out of me.",negative
1559,"When people said this was dumbed down they weren't kidding. Is not necessarily the simplicity that makes this game bad, V is simple but it works. This game, I don't really know how to explain it but, it just makes no sense. What's the point of bulding wonders? You can build the same ones over and over again in different cities, it doesn't even matter if the AI build them first. And although they give you some bonuses they still are pointless and not needed at all. No worker unit. Imagine if this game was so dumbed down that the worker isn't an unit, tile improvements are done automatically once your borders grow and they become part of your territory. No auto-explore. That's right, if you want to explore you have to keep moving the unit by yourself, is annoying, btw there are no scouts in this game, you explore with warriors. No open borders. There's simply no way to get pass other civs borders unless you declare war to them, so if one of your units gets stuck between AI borders your only option if to delete it if you don't want to declare them war. Diplomacy is non-existance. I don't even think this game have diplomacy. The AI only talked to me the first time I met them and when they decided to declare me war for stupid reasons. That's it. It feels as if other civs don't exist in this game, you don't feel them, is like you are alone in the world and those other civs are there just to block your pathway. The map is very small. The game pace is always quick. No custom settings. You just choose yor civ and start a game.

It does have some nice things that Civ VI will implement like forming a division with three units and the way cities look in this game is similar to how they will look in Civ VI. I also like how some civs have more than two unique units. But that's about it.

This game feels like it was made for mobile devices and also children. Is too easy. Everything is automatic. And there is no strategy involved. Keep spawing warriors and conquest the whole world in a few turns. I only played one game and I didn't even finish it. I expected more from a Civ game.

tl;dr - If you have never played another Civ game you may like this but if you played at least V then this game will be unplayable.",negative

The one thing that made me throw it in the trash however, is the loss of in game saves if you want to quit for awhile and come back later. In other words, lets say you play an hour, and decide you want to turn off the pc, or go mess around in another program so you save your game and close the program. Well, surprise! When you come back you HAVE TO START THE LEVEL ALL OVER!!!! This is pitiful! You have to complete a level at one sitting or you have lose everything.

1563,"After playing other Spiderman games I figured this one would be about the same with new missions. It isn't - in fact it is astoundingly bad.
There are some major issues:
First the bad plot that has almost nothing to do with the movie. Do you remember Brock getting fired because he dressed up like black Spiderman and mugged people? How about MJ breaking up with Peter because he got nasty and knocked over a wine glass? What about Sandman's kid locked in the trunk of the taxi that MJ was dangling from at the end? I would like to know if Activision was simply not told the majority of the plot or if they just decided to kind of made it up as they went along?
Second the short length. After long side missions I beat the game in 7 hours. I bet you could finish the game in less than 5 without the side missions. They also cut several storylines from the PS2 version like Kingpin, Rhino, and Scorpion.
Third, it looks like they replaced the actors with zombies. Mary Jane looks the worst. Seriously though, this game is a textbook example of the uncanny valley.
Fourth the controls suck. There is a slight delay in your attacks, so combat is hard to get used to. Also they removed many of the fun moves from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B0000B0MNH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>.
There are also tons of glitches. I loved it when in a mission a guy decided to stand on my shoulders, or get carried in the air slightly to the left of me. Also you can frequently fail a mission because all of these glitches.
Finally the amount of loading is ridiculous. For example if you have just completed a mission this is what will happen. First loading, then text says ""Mission passed!"" followed by more loading. You get a few XP then loading...again. Five second cut scene. You guessed it - more loading.

There is some good in the game. Bruce Cambell as usual is a top notch narrator. Also the gang wars are an improvement on 2 and actually makes it seem like what you do positively affects the city.

In the end this is a depressingly bad game.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B0000B0MNH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>&nbsp;was infinitely better.

1565,"Pro's:
Cool story
Cool characters
Voice acting works really well for the characters
Aesthetically the game is pretty snazzy.
Music is decent
Magic attacks are pretty cool and work well.

Con's
Gameplay
QUICKTIME EVENTS (INSERT SLEW OF CURSE WORDS HERE ON THIS GARBAGE)
Camera Controls (ESPECIALLY during one particular boss fight later in the game where you can't move the camera around.. and get your bearings..)
No Jump Button
No Run Button
Save System (or lack of one to some degree)

Okay, this game is a hack n slash, with a bit of RPG elements.. you can level up your magic, and you can level up a couple of the Knights attacks.

Like most games that fall short, the developers pulled some douchebag moves.. IE around Chapter 9, or their about in Rapunzel's castle, you gain an item that lets you collect more souls when you defeat an enemy. When game creators do this...you know something is wrong, having to have an item to get an ROI(return on investment) on defeating enemies.

Anyways, since the game revolves around combat..  gameplay/character controls needs to work, and it needs to work well. I constantly felt like I was fighting against the controls of the game.. another words my character was sluggish... activating man hole covers and ladders and switches was annoying.. because it only half worked. You've also got a lot of ground to cover in the game.. and your character moves like a brick. I know what your going to tell me probably.. ""But he's big and muscly..etc"" Well, you guys have seen elephants and lions and linebackers charge right? yeah when you got muscle's you can move fast..  in burst if nothing.

So Heinrich's move set as far as moving and combat.. could have used some vast tweaking.. to get him to respond better, and be a better fighter. Because you face some enemies in the later game, where his.. floundering about in combat.. will having you foaming with anger. And it would be nice to be able to block attacks with a shield or something.. what the heck?

Anyways, over all I am not happy or sad I bought this game. I some how ended up at a ""meh"" kinda place mentally.

1568,"I do not understand why a company would take a very good game like DAO and change it until DAII hardly resembles the original.  Some changes were for the better but not many.  The graphics are great but that is the best part of the game.  The changes streamlined some tedious aspects of DAO like potion creation, for example, but also eliminated the ability to get a rogue up to unlocking all but the easiest chests.  The use and reuse and reuse and reuse of the settings were ultimately boring and extremely cheap, considering the original price of the game.  I felt cheated of what I was expecting to be a good game.  The game is boring, unchallenging and trite.

Has anyone else uncovered the homoeroticism?  It might have been in the original but, if so, I missed it.  I just replayed to check out a hunch and found quite a few ""tender"" scenes and suggestive dialogue between Fenris and Hawk and Anders and Hawk.  If you say the right thing at the right time, you get some interesting events.  I am allowing my grandson to play the original but will not let him play this one because it is too erotic.",positive

1570,"The game stands out for its improved graphics I must say.  However, this particular game isn't the winning racer for me.  The variety of luxurious cars was pretty good, however it was the game play that really bombed.  The hits cars take from each other was a little bit too ""weak"" and unrealistic.  When a car bumps into another it wipes out very quickly, which seems unrealistic again (unless someone can verify that realism by driving over 170 mph on the streets).

I wasn't impressed much, the online game play against other races wasn't too bad and might be worth added to how the graphics are to score some pointers for the game, but it just wasn't all that.  One thing that would be great is if the cars were customizable.  But in this game, what car you buy is what you get, nothing to customize.  Even a Grand Turismo (best racing simulator in my opinion) you can customize some aspects of the car, but not in PGR 3.

This game wasn't a seller, so I traded it back to get Need for Speed Most Wanted, which I must say would be much more my type of racing game.  Overall, not that impressive of a racing game unless you just want to watch the 'stock' cars racing on your TV instead....",negative
1571,"[Please see edit made on 9/19/16 below the main review!]

Let me begin by saying I purchased this mouse on a separate account! I had some credit left over on there and decided to use that!

Now, I had to get a new mouse simply because my Razer Deathadder broke. It had the worst double-clicking issue I'd ever had on a mouse! 6 or 7 clicks on a row before a single click. It was maddening! I decided that I had to grab a new one.

I did tons of research before settling on this bad boy, and I couldn't be happier.

BUILD: The mouse itself feels as if it's built better than my $60 Razer mouse, and does twice the things! The customization RGB LED's are a huge plus (and yes, there are 16.8 million colors!) It feels absolutely amazing, by far one of the most ergonomic mice I've ever used! It's covered in some kind rough matte plastic, but feels great underhand; very grippy and doesn't collect oil or dirt at all! The buttons feel very tactile and well built!

SOFTWARE: Since many of the reviews have been left on here, the software has been updated and is an absolute dream to work with! It has an awesome interface and is very simple! It allows insanely precise customization for DPI and polling rate. It has 5 dedicated profiles! (the number of profile is indicated by the mouse wheel light, and the DPI profile is indicated by the two arrow buttons below the mouse wheel!) It also allows for customization of every button on the mouse, acceleration, point speed, scroll speed, and even double click speed!

PERFORMANCE: This mouse delivers, hands down. It's insanely accurate and moves smoothly, completely free of any jitters! I play a lot of the game OSU, a mouse-based rhythm game, and I'm not saying it's due to this mouse, but I've been getting more and more perfects since I got this!

Overall this mouse has performed better than its Razer predecessor! It feels absolutely amazing, and I'd absolutely buy from Redragon again! Thanks guys, and I hoped this helped! Go with this one if you have any doubt!

EDIT: 9/19/16

I've been meaning to make this edit for so long, but I simply can't recommend this mouse anymore. It worked for about 2 months perfect, until it became plagued with absolutely maddening problems. First off, sometimes when I turned it on, it just wouldn't work, simple as that. The cursor just wouldn't move! And sometimes when it did, it would be inverted! For no reason! Another thing is sometimes it would just wiggle in place; you wouldn't be moving the mouse, but it would just kind of wiggle ever so slightly! And on top of this, it had a sluggish input after two months! I get it's cheap, and that reflects very clearly!

1572,"Ironically, my favorite XBox games of all time are the original Conflict series games... Desert Storm, Global Terror, etc.  I don't know what they were thinking when they made this game.  It takes too many steps backward.

I play strictly single-player.  I like being able to position my players where I want them.  The biggest pain in the butt with this game is that you can position your teammate where you want him, but then he'll saunter off on his own, or, worse yet, run out into the open, right into a hail of bullets.  You can place your teammate at a strategic location to watch your back, and next thing you know, you got killed from behind because your teammate decided to walk off, descend a ladder, and crouch behind a wall somewhere.  It's frustrating as all heck, because you're always switching players in order to regain control over the one that's moving around on his own, so you can put him back where you want him.  I can't believe none of the programmers caught this before the game was released.

It's also a lot easier for the enemy to kill you than it is for you to kill them.  Take three rounds, and you're toast.  But when you're fighting the enemy, unless you nail them square in the head, you may have to unload a lot of ammo to bring them down.

Even when you get the hang of things, you never really do. Everytime you think you have it, the next scene has MORE and bigger, badder enemies. That would be fine if there had been some training in the beginning, something to tell you how to fight combo, sneak successfully. It's pretty straight forward; you follow a path, climbing and burning your way to your goal. Which of course you can't see very far ahead. That's everything wrong without the stiff, mechanical gameplay, nothing new story, and speedchanges.

Really if you must try this as a fan, rent it. By the time it's due back, you'll be plenty frusterated. It's games like this that make GOOD ""games like this"" never get made. I guess we'll never get Veronica Mars the game?

1576,"I am a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise, and have loved every installment except this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but when compared to other chapters of the AC saga, it's depressingly bad in almost every regard!

First, the game is without question the shortest Console based AC game released. When I finished the game, I was actually surprised because it FELT like I should only have been a little over halfway through. I mean, if the game was released on the PSP or Vita, then the length would have been acceptable, but for a console version? It just doesn't stack up!

The graphics are nice! However, they aren't really any better than Brotherhood. So, while I wasn't too disappointed with the graphics, I also wasn't thrilled. I did expect more from the game, because it was a sequel, and I just naturally assume the graphics will be better than the previous title in the franchise.

The story and setting was poor at best, and while it could have been worse, it could have also been so much better. It feels rushed, and because of that served as a disappointed. However AC3 made up for the lackluster performance of Revelations.",positive
1577,"UPDATE: 03/15/16

The plastics on these things are terrible.  Not only have both extension arms broken on my pair, but so have 2 of my friends' pairs.  My pair hung on the extremely over-priced stand from Turtle Beach and were never under ""undue"" stress.  I've since epoxied mine back together and have looked to brace them with a thin metal exo skeleton on the arms, but this should not have been necessary.  Due to the price, this is necessary to avoid wasting a LOT of money.  Do yourself a favor and skip these.

While the sound on these things are indeed excellent, you won't be able to here anything when the cups are bowed away from your ears due to the inferior plastics.

UPDATE 11/7/14:

TLDR:  Sound great, usability is weak.

The Details:

The sound is top notch and the ability to hear yourself in the headset is a huge plus.  I've heard little details that I have never heard before.  I've got a pretty nice audio set up with Martin Logan speakers in front and Pinnacle 3-Element speakers in the rear all being pushed by an Elite receiver and an SVS cylinder for low end.  In order to hear this level of detail from my set up, I would have to crank the volume to a level that wouldn't be acceptable in a family home.  These cans put the audio right next to your ear without it sounding like you're standing next to a speaker.

The mic is sensitive enough that, when combined with the 3 levels of personal audio, I can hear most of the things going on in the house even though I've got the cans on.  This is a big plus for anyone with kids.  I haven't really played with all of the various pre-sets on these things yet, because I found the default to be quite good.

All is not roses and rainbows however:

Charging is a problem as described by other reviewers.  (most disconcerting is the lack of a removable battery pack)  Over-all the buttons on the mic side can are harder to manage than the other side due to the mic protruding from the center of the can.  A better design would have put the mic on the edge.  The center mount is only necessary if the cans were reversible but they are not.  The angle of the cups makes wearing in the opposite direction a little odd and the direction of sound would be reversed (no option to switch).  This of course would mandate the personal audio wheel be relocated, but that is a design concern.  Oddly, the mic side ear cup is smaller than the other.  This isn't TOO big of a deal, but you will likely feel your ear touch the inside of the cup.  (when I wore in reverse to test this, understanding these are not reversible, my other ear touched the inside of the cup.  I measured depth to verify.)

The only odd occurrence with audio is when I first start using them.  Each time, my party says I sound distant or muffled.  Within a couple of minutes, the issue resolves itself with no adjustment from me, so I am not 100% on the cause.

Over-all, if I could, I would give these 4.5 stars.  Since I can't, I am going with 4 stars.

Because this is not Turtle Beach's first outing with headset design, it is a little annoying that they haven't added simple things larger volume wheels, more tactile buttons, and a separate controller mounted puck for quick muting and volume control.  (The lack of controller mounted puck with mute and volume control means you have to relinquish the controller to make adjustments on the mic side can making their use during game play a little cumbersome.)  At this price point their 15$ stand should have been included.  Those things did not, however, influence the loss of a star.

UPDATE 11/6/14:
Turtle Beach released additional information for failed firmware and a method for getting the device into bootloader mode for a clean install.  The information can be found at the following:

[...]

I had to follow clear to the last step before there was success.  My gear is now at the following versions:

Transmitter (1.2.3)
Headset (1.0.5

The 1 star rating is now a 2.  I will update again in a day or two once I have had time to actually put these things through their paces.  It is nice that Turtle Beach recognized an issue with their headset, not so nice that their promised business day response time was not followed through.  More to come.

OLD:
I pre-ordered these things as soon as I learned about them.  It's hard to believe a truly wireless headset didn't come with the One, and odd that it took so long for one to be released.  (and the premium... ouch)

The reason for the one star:  Bricked.  Opening the package, I decided to RTFM.  The first thing is says is to update the headset.  So I hop on Turtle Beach's website, download their v2.0.4 Ear Force Audio Hub and install it.  It updates immediately to v2.0.5.  It says ""...please attach a Turtle Beach device..."" so I plug the headset in.  The computer updates a driver and the Turtle Beach tool immediately hangs on ""Loading Device"" then goes to ""Load Device Failed."" while advising me to disconnect and reconnect the device.

After a couple rounds of plugging in and unplugging, I sift through the Turtle Beach site and find that I need to plug in both the Transmitter AND the Headset.  Fair enough, my mistake just doing the headset.  I plug in the transmitter first and it recognizes the device.  It then updates the firmware, as expected, and then prompts me to plug in the headset, which I do.  No joy.  Same issue.  I unplug and re-plug the device.  Still no joy.  I then unplug both and plug them back in.  Now neither device is recognized.

I thought, ok.. maybe it still works, it just won't update.  I plug everything into the One as directed by the instructions.  The transmitter just flashes LEDs 2 and 4 without ever going solid.  I can find no literature on this flashing.  I am now dead in the water with what is essentially a DOA device.

All instructions were followed as written online at their website and in the provided documentation.  I can hear some of you saying ""But this isn't a review of the HEADSET!""  Actually, it is.  There was no external or negative test case here.  This headset was provisioned and installed as documentation dictated.  I submitted a trouble ticket to Turtle Beach and am waiting to hear back from them.  If/when I hear back, I will update this review.  For the time being, I am stuck with a 250$ paper weight set.",neutral
1578,"Rememember when arcade hoops games were so much fun, just pickup and play? I Remember playing NBA Hangtime in college with my friends, we did 2 on 2 action and it was the best of what Midway did, arcade sports! As of late, Midway has kind of turned me away from their titles. And with E.A.'s serious hooper called NBA Street, Ballers seems to fall short in the fun factor category.  NBA Ballers on the XBOX was Midway's first return back to arcade hoops since NBA Showtime, and while I did like Ballers quite a bat, the Chosen one gets away from the fundamentals of the game, and it's just simply not that fun to play. The first issue is the graphics. This simply is not a next gen looking game. The courts look sweet enough, but the players look fake, and their faces and skin looks too fakey fakey to be taken literally. Motion caputred moves get the job done, but once again, things are way over done and nothing looks amazing to knock your socks off. NBA Street Vol 3 looks better and that game was out quite a some time ago. The main issue with the game is that you don't have to check the ball out after a rebound. So basically the game consists of you ""if you wanted"" standing under the basket for a rebound then instantly going up for the dunk with no reason to take the ball back or play defense. This problem takes away zero strategy on both offense and defense. Checking the ball is a standard for all street hoops game, especially for 2 on 2 or 1 on 1 battles at 1/2 court. The gameplay is fair, but pulling out special moves seems to complictated for it's own good and the 360 controller is not implimented as well as it could have been. But even when you leave out the special moves and stick with jumping, blocking, and dribbling, the game still feels lathargic and the lack of any real strategy thanks to not having to checking the ball out, ruins the game.  I had the most fun going online and playing with people, you can 1 on 1 and 2 on 2 battles against people onilne ,but once again, the gameplay still is ruined. If you can request people to check the ball out after each rebound, makes the game to be more enticing.

I love arcade hoops titles, the classics like NBA Hangtime, Jam and Showtime will always be missed. It's too bad the step to next gen has been a step back  for fun, at least with Midway's hoops titles. The Chosen one can't even get the basics down right and ruins the game. Might be worth a rent or two with some friends, but other than that, you might as well keep playing NBA Street Vol 3 or wait for Street 4...

Graphics: Players faces look like their real counterparts and the facial expressions are nice, but the bodies look fake and their bodies are way over done. What is that, paint gloss over their bodies?

Gameplay: Performing special moves are tricky, and just not fun to pull off or watch as you do them. With the new midway rule of not having to check the ball out, you can stand there and wait for a miss, then go up for the next shot. Um, no Midway, this ruins the game.

Sound: Good music, good sound effects,  not much chattering.

Fun Factor: A few games online might be fun for a bit, but once again, the lack of having to check the ball out after a miss, takes any fun that there was available, out of the game completely.

Overall: Stick with NBA Street Vol 3, you can pick that game up for under 20 bucks now and it's still the better game of hoops. Better luck next time Midway. Bring back NBA Hangtime and I'll be happy.",positive

The biggest grip I have with the game is the weapon system. It seems to me that the whole idea was based around a micro-transaction system. It makes the developers seem greedy and ruined the once great weapon system in the series.

1584,"Let me start by saying that this version of 'Lost' is virtually identical to its 360 counterpart.  The only difference is that the PS3 version installs part of the game on the console's hard drive to make the (rather obnoxious) loading times a little more palatable.  Other then that the two games are exactly the same.  If you already own one version, there's no reason at all to double-dip.

Being a modest fan of the show, I was looking forward to checking 'Lost' out at some point.  Recently my local library actually started to lend out a small selection of 360 games; so when I saw that 'Via Domus' was among the games I grabbed it for myself.  Now that I've finished it, I can say that although the game isn't offensively bad, I'm really glad this isn't one that I paid for.

As for the good, the rendering of the island itself is really quite good and the jungle certainly has the right, lush, tropical, look and feel to it.  It still travels sort of linear though.  If you travel too far off track, you'll just be bounced back on the correct path.  I think it would have been more fun if it was a little more open so you could just carve your own paths with a machete and map out the island on your own.

The music for the game uses the score to the TV show, so the sound to the game is completely authentic and terrific.  The voice acting, on the other hand, is god-awful.  Virtually nobody from the A-list cast showed up and nobody sounds like themselves.  John Locke's voice in particular, I didn't think was even close.  It's strange too, because I remember several interviews with Matthew Fox doing press for the game.  I just assumed his voice was included, but it isn't.

The game includes a bartering system to gain objects; you'll trade papayas and coconuts for a torch or a lantern, for example.  Unfortunately, outside of a couple of torches and one gun (which, I kid you not, you shoot no more then three times ... only one of which is a person) you don't really need anything.  The whole trading system turns out to be kind of a farce.

The story is OK and mildly interesting, even if the ending had me scratching my head, but it is REALLY short.  I finished the game 100% in what couldn't have been more then 5 hours of play.  I was hoping that, to some extent, 'Lost' would use games like 'Drakes: Uncharted' or 'Tomb Raider' as a template for it's game play but instead the game play itself FEELS like an episode of the TV show and its not very interactive.  This has the game commit the mortal sin of just being dull.

Simply put, there's just no meat here to sink your teeth into and with very little else going in the right direction, there's not much at all working for the game to justify a purchase.  If you were a die-hard fan of the show and, somehow, fall into a copy of 'Lost' I can't honestly say it's not worth, at least, checking out.  That said; however, if you have to plunk down so much as a nickel to play this, skip it.  It's just not worth it.  I'd have been really disgusted with myself if I paid anything to play this.",negative
1585,"Please get rid of the cart. Very few people like it. Amiibo Party is a step in the right direction, but it's not enough. I am begging you, Nd Cube. I've waited so many years for another true Mario Party, and this just isn't it. Sorry to sound so negative, but it's the truth. My disdain for the newer games isn't nostalgia based. It is based on the actual content of the games. I don't want Candyland on steroids. I want Mario Party.",negative
1586,"This game have the misleading title of White Knight Chronicles II but in reality it's a extended full version of WKC. The game overall is very good and even if the story was not that good it felt like a old PS2 RPG with updated graphics and that was a good thing.

Now the main focus of this game was the online that have a lot of quests and different type of equipment. Most of these quests relied on teamwork and the knowledge of each class.

This game received poor support in the west. Sony and D3P never unlocked all of our quests that are contained on the disc including the Avatar quests (These avatar quests are 10 in total) These quests are the true ending of the game and it's referenced on the To be continued ending of the standard story. Once you complete avatar story a new shop it's available on the map with exclusive items. The other non avatar quests are numerous and contain unreleased equipment.

Sony and D3 Publisher are ending all the online service on June 18 2013. If you're interested on a standard RPG play this game as IMO was better than FFXII but if you want to get the Platinum, stay away from this game as once the online servers gets offline on June 18 it will become VERY Hard to get the Platinum.",positive

1588,"I own this game, and it doesn't come close to its original (Harvest Moon 64)!  In Save the Homeland, you can't get married, there are no sheep, no festivals, no babies, the game ends after 1 year of play, you must work for a horse, and there aren't many fields to grow crops!  I must say though, the graphics are the best I have ever seen!  But I didn't think the graphics were worth the price for the game.  So, my opinion is, Don't get it!  If you don't have Harvest Moon64, spend your money on that!",positive
1589,"You know, I am sick of all the hype about this game by a bunch of weenies that don't seem to know real combat, real weapons or realism of any sort beyond what they see on their TV screens.

This game is not the authentic real life war on-the-battlefield war game that all the geeks are hyping and signing the party line the company puts out.

I bought two of these games after reading the reviews and I have to say that you people don't know what you are talking about.

There is pseudo-realism and that is about it. Sure the maps are close, the look and sounds of the weapons are close and even the dialog is about right, but that is about as far as it goes.

These games fall down severely on the accuracy/authenticity in several key areas.

1. Ludicrous restriction on the tactical options available to the soldiers and the squad leaders. Some of this is bad level design, some of it is probably trying to make up for the limitations of their AI, and some of it is just plain dumb.

2. Ridiculous limitations on interaction with the environments. You cannot open doors or windows. You cannot climb fences. You cannot use the wire cutters that every paratroop carried. You cannot go under a normal barbed wire fence, which thousands of hunters do several times a day in america.

Barrels and crates don't blow up or even move when hit by a tank. You can't even climb over a low wall that some other men just went over.

Perhaps most unforgivable of all, you cannot go into a prone position or crawl. You know, the stuff they teach everyone in BASIC TRAINING!

3. The gunsights are ludicrous. The amount of creep even in a crouching position is ridiculous. If I was that shakey I'd head for the retirement home.

4. Terrible path blocking and object collision detection. Quite a few times when I had a perfect view of a target and as perfect a sight picture as you would ever want I could not hit the target no matter how many rounds I fired. In real life I would have put a round through both ears of my target.

5. Absurd size of the weapons relative to your field of vision when zoomed in. Come on folks this is ridiculously UN-authentic. There is a reason for the open sights on fast action weapons like the Thompson and other SMG weapons.

6. Really stupid scenario designs. There are several instances where you are put face to face with tanks and no tactical options except to run for enemy panzerfausts. Making this worse of course are the level designs that force you to follow a relatively linear and restricted path to said anti-tank weapons. This is completely ridiculous.

7. Poor level designs. Too many places you cannot go or step when you should be able to. Places you cannot jump over or crawl under where you should. Only in EIB do you get to even blow holes in the hedges with the TNT that all paratroops carried as part of their standard pack during that theater of operations, and then only in key places and one whole scenario.

8. Situational awareness mode. Give me a break. This is supposed to substitute for the advance study done by the troops? It's not even as good as a raw topo map dump. You are chained to camera angles around key points and there are no indications of any significant type for changes in elevation and quite often the terrain features are faded out due to the choices made for the camera angle.

9. Another limiting factor is that you cannot issue movement commands to a  location you know is there but are not lined up on directly yourself and you had better be on the side away from the enemy when you issue the order. This could have been easily fixed by using some option to issue commands while in situational mode, especially if that were better done.

10. Lastly the much hyped authentic tactics. Authentic, sure, in a very introductory and watered down way, severely limited in permutations, applications and variations due to all the other limitations of the game.

By the way, I am both a veteran and an experienced programmer and I am highly disappointed with this game on both counts.

If this is the latest in realism then it shows what a sorry state the gaming industry really is in. Of course I still haven't seen AI in a commercial game yet that matched up to what I saw undergrad programmers doing in college during the 80s. We deserve better and it's not that hard to do. It's time we stopped allowing these companies to hype this stuff up like it is so great when it's all fluff like pretty pictures and sound.

Oh, one PS. The AI cheats. You can observe how the enemy becomes magically aware of things completely out of the blue, such as someone being behind them, not moving or firing, and behind cover. This is inexcusable.",negative
1590,"The Graphics is nice but the gameplay sucks. Battlefield 3 was okay. I couldn't even finish the game. I wish EA go back to making killer games like the used to.

1591,"This game is pretty bad. The graphics are straight out of the PS2, at best. The handling is very arcade--under/oversteer and that's pretty much it. The yellow cautions are -extremely- annoying--once you're involved in a crash, you must go through the entire pitstop/restart pain before you can do anything (e.g., restart the race). The rendering of some tracks is not accurante--I've driven Watkins Glen and the esses for example are not quite like that: too much Armco on the inside of Turn 4. Good thing I rented first.",negative

1593,"I used to love Final Fantasy. I played 1-6, and loved them all. Final Fantasy 3/6 is one of my favorite games of all time. But personally, for 7 and beyond, I kind of fell off the boat. I never really liked the transition to 3d, especially because it heralded the introduction of the hour-long cutscene. I got very tired of watching movies instead of playing games, and I never really got back on board from these experiences. Hard-up for a good JRPG, I decided I'd try my best to give 13 a go. Square/Enix has had a while to refine the formula, so maybe things would be different.

The good:
-The graphics are shiny. I won't quite agree with people claiming this is the best-looking game ever, but it's a good-looking game. The game employs a now-common trick where you see much more graphically rich character models while adventuring or in cutscenes, then much lower-quality models in the actual battles. Since I only care about the battles, I see pretty standard graphics for a current game.
-Sazh has a chocobo in his afro. It's pretty cute / funny.

The bad:
-Er, everything else.

This game is only as challenging as you want it to be. In battle, you shift between Paradigms, which are basically scripts for the characters. Everything happens so fast that direct control should only be used for micromanagement, so the majority of the time you're just shifting paradigms and watching the results play out (which does not make me happy). Theoretically, you could just use a healing Paradigm all the time and only attack while you're buffed out, to win every battle with little or no challenge. The game tries to balance this by having a reward system that basically gives you more XP for finishing battles faster. However, if you max out your ratings all the time, you will often hit arbitrary level caps which are set throughout the game and are only released as you progress in the story. So really, there's a lot of room to play things conservative, which really defeats the purpose of the ratings system, and you can get really lazy on the ratings if you're going to grind and do side-quests. Speaking of which...

Yes, this is Final Fantasy on rails. There is no world map, there basically aren't any towns, and because your levels will max out at various points there's not that much motivation to finish off sidequests. Except that they made gil(money) a little more rare to encourage you to put up with the bother if you want to assemble the best items. The illusion of choice is just so transparent. You only ever have one place to go, and everything else along the way is only there for completionists. Instead of crawling towns to find a store, there's one floating box you'll find appearing throughout every level that's a magical save point / store / options menu rolled into one. They might as well have just had autosaving checkpoints and let you purchase items at any time.

So basically, you have to make your own fun. You can shift paradigms, you can manually control characters, you can grind all the sidequests... and you'll have hit the current level cap ten hours ago and just built up a wealth of XP that will mean you have the exact same problem even faster on the next chapter.

And the story? For all the millions of dollars spent on animation and voice acting, there's really nothing there. Yes, technically, there's an incredibly complicated backstory and tons of development- everyone in the game rambles on for thirty minutes at a time in cutscenes, so plenty gets said. However, since there's no world map, you never have to worry about where you're going next. Since you're often going to be at max level, there's no need to worry about who you're fighting. Since all you're really doing is going from point A to point B in the meantime, with no real choices to make other how much you feel like grinding, there's no reason to worry about why you're fighting. Cutscenes for me boiled down to waiting for Sazh's Chocobo appear, which didn't happen nearly often enough to balance out all the rambling.

So overall, it's just a very mediocre game weighed down by overly long cutscenes. It's pretty, but it's shallow. There's tens of hours of gameplay to be had, but you never really have any reason to care about any of it. Except the baby chocobo. And then only because it's cute.

The puzzling:
-Orange and blue. There's been a trend in marketing in recent years where it's been discovered that the colors orange and blue have the most visual contrast, and therefore the most impact on viewers. Go ahead and try to find a single minute in this game where the colors orange and blue aren't onscreen together- I dare you.",positive
1594,"Evil under the Sun (wii) is a typical point and click game. So if you don't like point and click games, avoid this one like the plague. I find this game absolutely boring and irritating. If you consider going from one end of an island to the other end and back again, then back again, and so on and so forth adventurous, then you must have a pretty lame life. The story is OK, but it is not at all gripping, its all work. There are not enough clues to really play on, at least common sense ones, and You spend most of the time traveling from one end of the island to the other trying to find one person to speak with in order to progress. Or in some instances if you just fail to pick up an item that is barely seen to the naked eye, you will find yourself just pointlessly running back and forth trying to figure out what you missed so you can progress. It was impossible for me to beat without looking at a walk through at times. Why did I give it 2 stars? I am merciful.",positive
1595,"For those who won't read the entire review, I received a defective controller (with stiff buttons if it had worked) and found original OEM Sega controllers restored to like new condition for a similar price elsewhere. Read on for details.

When the item arrived it came in nicely designed package and the actual controller looked great, unfortunately from there I had nothing but problems.
As I held the controller in my hands, the weight was nice but the buttons immediately felt stiff. It's been a long time since I held a Genesis controller but my muscle memory just knew the buttons required more pressure than the OEM Sega controller. This is especially true of the A, B, & C buttons as the top row always had a little extra stiffness on even original controllers. This wasn't ideal but it wasn't a deal breaker either.
When I tried to plug the controller in, it wouldn't go into the port. I tried gently attempting different angles (for fear of breaking the pins on my console) but there was one or more pins not allowing it to go in; I tried the 2nd control port and had the same problem and later tested both ports on another system with no luck. A careful inspection of the connector leads me to believe that one particular connector (the top left pin if looking at the holes on the connector) is defective. Most people who reviewed this item didn't have my problem so I assume the it's not incredibly common. I also want to add that that there are far less reliable brands than Hyperkin.
I would have just exchanged the defective controller for another until I learned of a far superior alternative. The website of a major national US video game retailer has original Sega 6 button controllers that have been meticulously restored to superb condition for almost the same price being asked here and they also have the 3 button model for half less than the 6 button (the retailer will remain unnamed, but if your interested why not stop by their game site). Amazon also sells the original Sega controllers but the listing are from 3rd party sellers who, based on the reviews, are often trying to pass off 3rd party controllers.

Multiplayer was ruined the second EA added p2w lootboxes. Thanks to a bloated manifest, maxing your manifest without paying real money takes about 600-700 hours. Lootbox RNG combined with a lot of hackers and some broken mechanics means this game is a no go.

1608,"As many have already said, this game is a great game, but it is almost entirely a complete copy of Gears of War with new story(very little, just as in part one) and new levels. If you played Gears one, then you played this game.

Do you all remember the big stink that was made over Halo 2 because it did nothing to expand the first game in the franchise? Well, I think we're there again with this game. That's not to say it's not a great game, but a sequel generally includes expanded and newer features. There is almost nothing new here. You still romp around with your teammates ducking behind barriers, taking potshots at baddies, tossing the eventual nade and taking down a huge boss at some point in the affair. The one major thing they changed is the lack of real boss-like enemies in the first game. This game adds a few more enemies that rival the size of an apartment building, but beyond that, I can't think of anything more of value to make this ""Gears of War 2."" As far as the story as concerned, its hardly worthwhile. GOW story was just your usual end of the world fair and this game is simply the linear continuation of the last chapter in the first one. They easily could have made this the last 2 chapters in GOW instead of making you pay $60 more for it.

If you loved the first game then you will undoubtably fall all over this one. I know I did way back when. Years later now, after having played the sequel and replaying the first one a few times, I think my initial reaction was a little exagerated. I'd easily give the first game 4 stars, but this one hardly deserves that. It was supposed to expand the series, not keep it in limbo.",neutral

The unlocked ""games"" (as opposed to the minigames) are, predictably, lame...they remind me of mind-numbingly dull space-invader wannabe games circa 1980.

6 some times explosions and wrecks happen in front of you and you cant see what direction to to on the track, Not to avoid but to turn left or right for a corner. There is no mini map on screen or anything. Since triggers can change the track it's not always the same lap and if you can't see the route you'll wreck or get lucky.
7 tracks are short and repeat and lots of triggers do nothing to your opponents (even when they use them on you) they blow you a bit and cause a drift but nothing bad. Only a few triggers on the track will wreck people and there are only so many per track so you have to know when and where.

Nut shell this is a poor version of a old burnout game. I think I should have got Blur instead.

Pro:
1soundtrack and sound effects
2 looks pretty good
3 the semi race that's like death race meets terminator with beefed up 16wheelers barrel chucking at you.

In the end all of this combined makes it less of a fun race game and more of a strategy game. Building gauge to use only when it will work and avoid the places on track you know can wreck you, try not to drift, if you do stop before a trigger or wall. It stops being what is could have been and falls way short of a good idea that had promise. Save your self the disappointment of this bad game. It's too late for me I have it now, but there are soo many better race games out there, pick them.",negative
1624,"Some would consider NFSU a classic, I do not share that same affection. The graphics are nice and glistening with lots of color, but the game is dark and the scenery blends together in a way that you barely make out where turns or walls are. Like an earlier reviewer mentioned before, you need to take your eyes off the road numerous times to glance at the map to judge where the next turn is. I found myself slamming against walls various times because I couldn't judge correctly where the next turn was. It's a frustrating experience to be in the lead nearly the entire race only to wipeout the last lap on a corner you couldn't see coming.

On the upside, there are many customizations that can be made to one of the many vehicles. From your paintjob, to decals, tires, nos/nitro, tinted windows and the like. I don't really find that as interesting though considering the game is essentially unplayable. I seriously can only make out things if I sit about two feet from my TV. I can't vouch for the PS2 version, but the XBOX version is a game I don't find the need to play again.",positive
1625,I've been playing these games since they came out and this one was horrible compared to the first 3. The whole alien idea was ridiculous. The side missions were lame and so were the main missions. They should have stuck to the same normal concepts as the first 3. Those were so much fun to play. I won't be buying the next Saints Row game which looks similar to this game. When they start making games like the original 3 I will start playing again.,neutral

1627,"I bought Bionic Commando with the knowledge that it was not the best game. I had heard that some people had fun with it, and that maybe the critics had been too harsh. I can safely say that this game earns every harsh word that comes its way. Not because it is a flat out bad game, but because what should have been a truly fun game seems to go out of its way to be the exact opposite.

First the good points.
1. The graphics are down right beautiful.
2. Using your Bionic arm is super fun once you get the hang of it.
3. It is fun to swing.

Wow. That was short. Now for the bad.
1. Those beautiful graphics that I mentioned only show ugly, delapidated buildings.
2. Your arm is limited throughout the first part of the game. You are shown how to do everything at the beginning of the game, but for reasons that are never explained, you aren't allowed to use your attacks until your never present commander reminds you how they work. Suck.
3. While swinging is fun, you are only allowed to swing in certain places. Even though the levels look huge, most of them are covered in nearly invisible radiation that kills you almost instantly. You won't know where these places are until you swing right into them and die. Super Suck.
4. The achivements are time consuming given how sporadicly the enemies are sprinkled throughout the levels, so you have two options. Try and have fun, or get the achievements. There is no in between.
5. Water is another near instant kill. Good luck finding something to latch on to in the 2 seconds you're given before you drown.
6. The snipers in this game can hit you from anywhere in the level. Tres unfair.

It seems like the developers of this game made two different versions. the first is a game with huge levels that you can use your super cool arm to zip around in while killing your enemies with style. the second game was put over the first one, and its only purpose it to limit how much fun you can have at any one time. Having fun swinging? Here take some invisible radiation that you can't avoid. You like the bionic arms combat functions? Well then, for the enemies that the style of combat would be affective against were not going to let you use any of the cool moves. When can you use them? When the snipers who can see from anywhere come into play and your melee options become pretty much zero seems like a good idea to us.

In short as well made as this game is, it goes out of its way to kill any fun that you could have had with it. If you want something like it, but fun buy Just Cause 2. Play now, thank me later.

1628,"I am pretty confident that I have played if not as much, more games than any reviewer on here and I can surely say this game is garbage. If you play Sega games (modern Sega games) you will realize they get a kick out of punishing the gamer more than rewarding them. This takes the cake. Brutally terrible checkpoint system, horrible combat system, and no its not a hack-and-slash but still, after about stage 4 on normal diffculty the odds become incredibly stacked against you. Its just plain not fun. the concept is cool and when you first start you can see how this could be a great game but overal its about the fun and experience and not a concept that keeps you playing. It lacks everything. The leveling up is a joke and no matter how good you do you will always get a C-Grade for your performance. diffculty level on normal would be hard or expert in most other games but yet again it is Sega where you must be punished for purchasing their games (not all but most).

1634,"The Good: Its gory, you can pee on things

The Bad: Extremely dated visuals with slowdown and bugs galore, potty humor that is somehow unfunny, broken movement, poor hit detection, lame weapons, same formula repeated over and over again, why bother?

Man where do I start. From a movie directed by the anti-Christ of video game movies to a game series that just refuses to improve on itself (whether on purpose or not is a mystery), Postal is just one terrible game series. Why Running With Scissors keeps making these stupid games with no improvements is beyond my comprehension.

Postal tries to shoehorn in raunchy and potty mouth humor, but does it in a way where it's not funny. How that is possible is a mystery as well. From using porn actor Ron Jeremy's likeness to dumb ideas like rampaging social justice soccer moms crashing porn shops, porn star signings, and other conventions with the lead mom looking like Sarah Palin. These ideas are dumb and should never exist. It doesn't help that Postal III tries to poorly copy Quintin Tarantino's art style. If playing as a guy named Dude and running around trying to help people, but constantly failing because he ends up killing everyone, sounds fun this game makes it unplayable.

At first it didn't seem so bad during the tutorial until you realized the game has poor hit detection. When my reticle is over something and bullets don't go anywhere near it, that is a serious issue and lazy game design. I honestly doubt RWS even play tested a smidgen of this game. On top of all this  they used the outdated Source engine so the game looks over 5 years old. There are even sounds and effects pulled directly from Half-Life 2! Movement isn't right either like it's still in alpha. Not to mention some of the weapons in this game are just dumb. A vacuum that sucks up garbage and launches it? This isn't Ratchet & Clank. Throwing feral cats? Using your own pee as a weapon? Not only are these stupid ideas but they aren't even done right!

The biggest issue is that everything is so mundane. Each ""level"" consists of the same thing over and over. Just run around killing these people. Nothing ever changes and it doesn't help that the game is really hard and enemies respawn until you complete the goal. How a developer can screw up this bad is just unheard of. It feels like Uwe Boll himself made this game despite the developers making fun of him in the game. Postal is a homeless person living in the streets of the game world and some people stop to talk to it, but realize that it is just a foul mouthed unfunny piece of crap. Absolutely no thought or effort was put into this game.

There's not much else to say, but don't play this or you will regret it. I wasted a whole hour trying to like this game, but just couldn't. Do yourself a favor and play any other game but this one. Even if you get this for free it isn't worth your time or hard drive space. Just ignore this piece of crap.",negative

1636,"As you might tell from my review, I'm not wholly pleased with these headphones. When I ordered them, I was initially excited about them. I have some Turtle Beach headphones that are slightly more expensive than these, but they do tend to become slightly uncomfortable after long periods of time.

So I ordered these. I was on the boat about the cord, but I actually prefer cords over wireless in such devices so that I don't have to worry about scrambling for batteries or charging it when the battery's low. The length of the cord is good for my living room.

When I plugged it into my PS3, having not yet read the instructions, I was surprised that there was no sound coming through. So I perused through the quick setup and was aghast that I, indeed, had to use the included audio jacks. I really really really really really don't like audio jacks. I understand that they might ""improve"" or have a work-around for audio, but the fact that I have to get my jacks out of my PS3 box just to plug `em into the back of the TV for audio (and since my TV has only one set of RCA ports, into which my Atari is plugged), it's really inconvenient and messy when I have to use the ol' red and white audio jacks. Haven't they done a work-around for this? I have HDMI cables, and I love `em. Surely Thrustmaster can do better. My Turtle Beach headphones, while understandably more expensive, connect into the front USB port...and that's it.

So when I finally did what Thrustmaster bid, I tried the sound quality, and it didn't negate my already negative feelings toward the headphones. The sound sounds almost tinny, and the headphones and their longest stretch barely fit `round my head, and I don't even have a big head! I usually click two or three times on headphones to make `em fit, but on these Thrustmasters I had to pull `em all the way and even then they fit just so.

I tried these on my iPhone, but the jack is a little big to fit with the case on my iPhone, so I took it out and tried the sound. It was rather worse since it was meant to utilize the red and white audio jacks.
Disgusting.

Overall, I am disappointed. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Creative and Turtle Beach headphones, but for the price Thrustmaster could do better. Or maybe even lower the price point. My $20 Sennheisers sound better, but I'm a big fan of Sennheiser. So there.",positive
1637,not the best game but not that bad. If your into racing game you may like it but if your a hard core gamer your may not,negative
1638,"You may note that I rated the game as ""fun"" but overall ""poor"". The gameplay can become a bit addictive, after a point. Once the hero becomes powerful and just doesn't stop, you can maul your way through enemies that once gave you problems. There's also a massive loot system, and you can combine simlar items to make higher-class ones. This makes for an incredible depth of customization, and a fun factor in picking your equipment, especially once you became the aforementioned death-dealing machine.

But up until you hit that mark, the game is just horrible. Heck, even after you hit it the game itself is still horrible. The story has some potential, but ultimately sounds like something that a two-year-old came up with. The hero loses his sister, searches for her, finds out she's been kidnapped, and then goes on a journey of self-discovery as he uncovers the truth behind a legend surrounding his family and the powers he and his sister share. The dialog used to deliver the story is absolutely bottom-barrel trash, and the voice acting throughout the game will make you cringe. I got to the point where I just read the dialog as quickly as I can so can skip the poor voice acting.

The map is asinine. First, it's huge, which is nice. But whoever made it basically took a giant square and ran a randomizer over it, plugging in a few numbers for ""max height"". Read: the game has too many hills. They're everywhere. There's no such thing as a flat plain anywhere. It's just up and down and up and down. It's like the developers never actually went outside to see if what they made makes any sense against the real world. I mean, it detailed and can be pretty at times, but the hills are just a pain. This wouldn't be a problem if not for two things:

1) it makes exploration very hard. If you take a wrong turn over a hill, you can end up sliding some stupid distance and not be able to climb back up. Because that one hill will be surrounded by dozens of others, most of which will prevent you from just hopping back up to where you left off, it can literally take 10 minutes to return to the top of it just to go the other way. This is incredibly obnoxious as you MUST explore the entire world to get the location achievements.

2) your horse is an idiot. Once you get one, you'll find that the horse randomly can't pass certain types of terrain. This is especially true of ~60% of the roads, which are bizarrely designed like very deep and broad ruts that are cut into the landscape instead of just being on top of the surface. The sides of most of these roads are so steep that the horse can't walk across them. You'll turn to leave the road to go explore some feature and the horse will get to the edge and then just stop or, more annoying, turn completely around and go the other way? You have to stop the horse, get up off of it, walk across over to where you wanted the a-hole to go, and then call it to you. You'll find that it can, in fact, make it across that spot, just not with you on it.

Speaking of the horse, it's annoying for another set of reasons:

1) it's supposed to make fighting foot soldiers easier, but it doesn't. The horse isn't very maneuverable, and the controls are just poorly done. So trying to fight enemies on foot is a pain of trying to get the horse to face the right direction and trying to get your character to swing his weapon on the right friggin' side of the horse. You also can't wield a two-handed weapon other than a bow from horse back, but you can use double-wielding from horseback. It's just weird.

2) you can pick up herbs and random objects lying on the ground and way out of reach from horseback, but you can't loot the enemy you just killed or open treasure chests from horseback. So you have to keep jumping on and off the thing every time you get in a fight.

3) the controls aren't just unintuitive, they're anti-intuitive. You have to press the up button to move forward. Normal, right? Not so when you realize that holding the button causes the horse to accelerate, and rapidly. And letting it go doens't stop the horse. Push up and let go of the controller, and the horse will keep moving forward. Neat? Kind of. But now you need to stop because some wolves are attacking you. You have to push ""down"" to stop. But you can only do that when the horse's movement is aligned with the screen. That is, if you've turned the camera to look to the side, you have to turn it back to face forward, THEN hit down to stop the horse. Otherwise, hitting down does something random, whether turning the horse to face toward the camera or turning it away or turning it some other random direction.

It's better to find a horse that can carry a lot of weight and just use it as a travelling treasure chest. Just park it near a transporter or in a nearby city and come back to it as you explore and find treasure you want to keep. The horse can save you a lot of travel time going between towns and cities, but only in areas where you've already killed all the enemies. And the transporter system works better anyway, and you don't want to try to be on the horse INSIDE the towns and cities because it's so unmaneuverable. I actually got my horse caught on a merchant to where the merchant's character was litteraly INSIDE my horse and neither of us could move, and I couldn't dismount because that button is the same as the talk-to-the-merchant button (poor controls). Fortunately, I was able to twist around and get free, but it took a while and was pain.

The controls are bad in every way. In combat, there's no blocking or dodging, just a ""jump back"". Swinging your weapon can take a while. Not that the swing is slow, but that it can literally take up to a FULL SECOND for the character to respond to the button press and swing his weapon. You can only swing a limited number of times, but that number appears to be random and situationally based and I have no idea what it is. I just know that after X-number of swings, I should just go ahead and hit the jump-back button before I get creamed. The ""jump"" button is also not the prototypical ""A"". It's ""Y""? X doesn't attack, but draws your weapon. The attack button is a trigger, but if you press it while under attack and your weapon isn't drawn, you don't attack? It's like the character is telling you, ""I'm getting hit and you're pressing the attack button, but my weapon's not drawn, so Ima just sit here and bleed everywhere."" What the hell?

The ""Power Wheel"" is a nice concept, but poorly executed. Each weapon has different skills associated with it, but the skills are grouped together so that if you assign a type for one slot, you assign several different weapon-specific abilities to that slot. All you have to do is change weapons, and the slot automatically changes to that weapon's skill from the same group. It's a nice touch, BUT, when you select the power from the D-pad, it doesn't pause gameplay to bring up the actual wheel. It just changes an icon in the top left of the screen, and because of the inaccuracies of the D-pad you often get the wrong power. And once you've selected the right power, you have to then press the other shoulder trigger. This makes combat a malay of pushing the attack trigger, desperately trying to select a power from the D-pad, and pushing the power trigger. I just leave mine on my heal spell and don't bother with the others because most of them have low percentage success rates anyway. All you really need in the game is just a lot of strength and an axe weapon with high slashing and bludgeon damage, and you can run over just about everything. The powers are mostly superfluous and not very useful.

Also, the treasure system is vast. This is, at first, a boon because you get to sweep through and get more and more powerful items. However, in order to combine items to make a higher-class one, you have to have two of the exact same type. Each piece of armor has a ""Set"" number, and there are least 600 ""sets"" in the game. A set includes helmet, chest, gauntlets, leggings, and boots. That's 3000 items in armor alone. Then there's dozens of different types of shields, and at least 100 different types of weapons, and at least 9 different types of ring. There aren't that many chests or enemies in the game, which means you're not going to find a lot of the same item in the wild. Some items are very powerful, but also super rare, so in order to get those to a decently effective and high enough class you have to find them and purchase them. This can be difficult as earning gold is limited since enemies do not respawn, chests do not refill, and you can only steal from each NPC one time. My suggestion is to save up until the very end and just power up your favorite end-game end-bringer by visiting shops.

The camera is also very annoying. It's constantly recentering, but the default angle the camera centers on is mind-bogglgingly bizarre. When you're on your horse, the camera recenters to what seems to be a large angle toward the sky. But since most of the game is bizarrely hilly as I've said before, and you'll be facing down-slope most of the time, this means that most of what you care about is going to be at the very bottom of the screen. If you try to angle the camera down, it will instantly retilt back up. When you're not on your horse, the angle is different whether you're running across a semi-flat area (usually ACROSS the side of a hill rather than down it), the angle is slightly upward. But if you're running downhill, the angle changes to look at a spot about a meter in front of your character, making objects just a few meters away disappear off the top of the screen. So you have to angle the camera upward to see where you're going. You also can't just hold the camera an angle since moving the stick even slightly will always move the camera as far to one side as it will go. So you have to constantly fight the camera's recentering by tweaking the right stick in the direction you want to move the camera. The entire game. Non-stop. It. Is. Really. Annoying.

Then there's the frame rate. The camera doens't move smoothly in any sense of the word. When turning, the screen jumps by at least an entire degree at a time. Running forward is jumpy too: object don't glide by the way they do in most smooth-motion games. They jump toward and eventually past you. The motion is eye-jarring horrible. You'll want to play this game on a small a screen as you can so you don't ruin your eyes with the motion-sickness-inducing frame rate. Part of the problem with the rate is from the fact that the game seems to load up the ENTIRE WORLD into memory, rather than just a small piece. If you can get high enough on one side of the map, you can see clear to the other side of it, including cities, towers, and fortresses. Most features, like smaller towns and NPCs, will pop into sight as you get close enough. But the actual lay of the land is visible at any distance, and you can see the trees being rendered from far away. If the developer had actually put a horizon that, the game would be a lot smoother.

Finally, there's the character themselves. I don't think they hired an artist to create the wireframes. They're just atrocious. Everything. The main character's main, NPCs, Orcs, Groms, and wolves are all ugly. Wolves don't have any of the sleekness or elegance associated with real wolves, either: they all look like pug-faced pitbulls and run around like spastic poodles. Bears are hideous. The only things that look halfway decent are the skeletons, and that's only because there's no a lot to them to screw up visually.

This game is bad. It's got a lot of good ideas, but it's just poorly executed. It definitely won't thrill you, and can be very frustrating at times. The dialog sucks, the story is sub-par, and the controls are bad. It is, however, mindless and generally easy to play. If you ignore the story and spend a few hours building up your character, it be an somewhat relaxing stress-relief to sit back, turn off your brain, and just tear through enemy ranks. When the price drops below $10, it can be worth the buy to have something to do for a week or so. But don't buy this game expecting to be wowed. Because, as an actual game, it does suck and sucks hard.",negative
1639,"This is a nice ideal, but problem is the Xbox 360 already comes with two USB ports.  The USB ports can support your average USB keyboard that will do much the same function.  I'd honestly save yourself some money and pick yourself up a cheap USB keyboard instead.",positive

A buzzing noise can be heard through the headset when it is plugged in with it's usb cable, but even when it is not the sound quality is still questionable. And the microphone barely worked, or sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. The only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one is that it did work somewhat and wasn't completely useless.

1642,"The foes you'll be fighting are repetitious and predictable - one kind you can easily kill by just kicking then finishing off with a heavy attack, another kind by just hitting the light attack button, another kind by kicking, then light attack then heavy, repeat. Oh, and you can be killed without ever getting hit sometimes.

The voice acting is pretty good, though alot of the time it doesn't feel like the character on screen is actually saying what they're saying (the audio's usually directional, except for a lot of the dialogue isn't and really feels disconnected).

The camera takes turns controlling itself and letting you control it. If you point your right pad to the left, the camera moves right, up, it moves down, and there's no option to change that schematic, or to change anything in the game - like brightness, sound effects, subtitles, nothing. That, and you usually can't tell who's fighting you from where, but just randomly pushing buttons solves that.

Visually, the art design's pretty good, but the animation is often clunky, weird, and usually unconvincing (watch for foes running with swords - who carries swords like that?!). And a lot of the cutscenes can't be skipped, so if you die a lot in one area you have to watch the same lame cutscenes over and over.

The platforming is a chore, as is fighting as it's tedious. The story is taken from the movies, which I thought was bad to begin with. And the much advertised slicing foes feature isn't as special as it sounds.

The whole storyline just felt slapped together at the last minute.  You can search the mall for new weapons and kill them in funny ways.  You can even try on different outfits-its fun to kill zombies in children's/women's clothes for a bit.  But eventually I just wanted the zombies to get the hell out of my way and complete the missions.  One impressive aspect of the game is that there are literally dozens of zombies moving on screen and I never experienced any framerate lags.

1645,"I purchased this bundle through Gamestop when they had a nice trade-in deal (for my old XBOX 360).  I am also a PS4 owner.  In my opinion the PS4 is a 4 star system, XBOX One is a 2.5 star system (rounded to 3).  Here's why:

XBOX One I just spent hours updating and ""installing"" the games that came with the bundle.  PS4 doesn't take more than a few minutes for this.  It seems the XBOX One must run less off the disc or something; it's painful to have to take 10-30 minutes to install each game. (my internet is cable and very fast btw).  For someone with poor internet, they'll likely have to spend an entire afternoon performing updates and installations before they can even use the console.  And as others mentioned, just installing the games that came with the bundle leaves you with ~680 GB free out of 1 TB.  Really?

The overall system interface and online store/etc. are not as intuitive on XBOX One as they are on PS4.  Physically the XBOX One is much larger and heavier than the PS4.

A few minor things about this particular bundle that I knew of, but are still skimpy: no headset whatsoever, Ori game is a download only, Gears/Rare Reply games come in a ""combo case"" instead of separate cases.  EDIT:  Also, if you have an existing headset-- guess what, Microsoft made the XBOX One controller with a proprietary connection!!!  You must buy a $30 ""XBOX One Stereo Headset Adapter"" if you want to use a standard 3.5 MM headset (like my old Turtle Beaches) with this system.  Wow, what a cash grab.

And my number one issue with the XBOX One-- Microsoft's claim of backward compatibility!  Well it turns out that very few titles (100ish) are compatible at this time (mid-December 2015).  According to their web site, more are ""in the works.""  Well, out of my 11 XBOX 360 discs, not a SINGLE game is backward compatible.  This includes games like Call of Duty: MW3 and World at War.  Or even Fable III or the Final Fantasy titles.  None of those are even ""in the works"" yet, and who knows if they ever will be.  Bottom line is this backward compatibility thing seems like a holiday scam in my opinion to get more sales.  Most of the games that are compatible seem like ""ARCADE"" titles or bundle titles sold on the XBOX store.  That includes several from the Rare Replay that came with this bundle.

After that paragraph I decided to round down to a 2 instead of a 2.5.  Overall I think this is merely a fair system.",negative

1648,"Cons:
It's basically a re-skinned Saints Row 3. It's clearly designed as a cash grab for minimal effort on the developer's side. The story isn't great, and it even takes a back seat for a majority of the game with the excuse being the player needs to complete random missions around the map to ""get the attention"" of the bad guy.
90% of the game takes place in ""The Matrix"", which makes the whole city and setting look dark and depressing, and random video glitches would occur every so often which started to get annoying after a while. Spending so much time in the darkened setting made me greatly miss the sun and brightness of Saints Row 3. You do unlock an option to change the skybox after you beat the game, but that's far too long of a wait just to get a prettier background. Also, knowing that the game is in a computerized simulation of the city made me feel like everything I was doing was pointless since it didn't take place in the real city.
Pretty much all of the side missions are recycled from Saints Row 3 - Rampage, Insurance Fraud, Driving a Tank, etc. The few missions exclusive to this game don't make it worthy of a purchase. The most notable is ascending large towers throughout the city to reach the top, but the camera angles don't lend this game to a vertical platforming style of gameplay, so it gets frustrating to not always be able to easily see where to jump. The tower does have checkpoints if you accidentally fall off, but the overall minigame is still just mindless jumping.

Pros:
The superpowers are fun to use. Flying and fast-running are great for navigating around the map. They're so useful and convenient, in fact, that it pretty much eliminates the need to drive vehicles in between missions. The few missions in the beginning are fun to play, and seeing the main characters in the oval office is a fun change of setting from previous games.

Summary:
Honestly, I recommend just playing Saints Row 3 again. Because that's basically what you'd be doing by getting this game, except you'd still have more fun and content with 3.",neutral
1649,This thing is a monster.  The controls are awkward and it doesn't feel right.  I bought the other controller which is smaller and the buttons are placed better.  I try not to use this big monster controller.  It makes playing games difficult.,negative
1650,Not a big fan of the newer Wolfenstein games.  They've gone a little too far out there for my taste.  Also the game play was a bit predictable and seemed pretty short.,negative
1651,"Amazon US doesn't list the PC version of this game. But it's pretty much exactly the same anyway.

First off, I hated how hard it was to stay alive in the first level. I went searching for codes on the Internet and surprisingly there is no codes, F.A.Q's, walk throughs, help guides ...nothing! (Ignore a code that says if you pause the game and type ""best kept secret"" it makes you immortal. It does not work at all)

I managed to find a site that had a download to run during the game that gives you max energy, power and ammo (invisibility). Found at [...] download that trainer thing. I give it 5 stars for working flawlessly.

Now that I couldn't be killed (except when I got squished in a thing) I was free to test out Robocop. I thought the game was pretty good. I played a level each day cause I'd have enough by the end of each level. I loved getting to level 3 and confronting ED-209. the graphics are decent 3D stuff. The quotes are amusing for a while, especially when you kill a good guy and Robo says, ""sowwwwwwreeeee""

However, a few of the levels I really grew tired of. Playing out like a Duke Nukem/Doom kinda game, it kinda got annoying on a level down in a mine where you have to destroy all the boxes before a certain door will open. A map would really help navigation out instead of wondering around till you wing it. The levels are too big to become instantly memorable so that you know where everything is in future. Sometimes they're just confusing as hell or annoying.

CONTROLS
The controls aren't that bad. You use your mouse to aim and shoot. The right button can be changed; I used it to open doors. You use your arrow keys to move. And various other keys do different things; Like a zoom feature. Or press 1 on the num pad to make Robo twirl the gun around.  ""Can you do that, dad?""

GRAPHICS
Compared to similar sort of games like Duke Nukem, GoldenEye, Wolfenstien ect... this ones nice on the graphics in its own way, the 3D graphics look awesome on some stages, others there quite boring. Tho, some stages have had more time and effort put into them. In some stages sometimes you can shoot various things like lights, signs, cars and things, but on other stages there just a graphic. Ed-209 looks great, but there are some things added for the hell of it I think. I didn't understand what a giant rat in a sewer was about. It's like someone developed a rat on their computer and decided to put it in a game just to see what it would look like.

The videos look dodgy. I'm ok with it that they're just to tell the story. But they looked like they where made and then there was no room left to add them to the game after it was completed so they got compressed to hell to fit on the disc.

SOUND
A lot of people complained about the sound of this game. I didn't complain about much of it. I didn't take much notice of the music, the quotes where amusing for a while. But in the end I was just playing without the sound on. It doesn't help with anything you need to do.

LEVEL 9
Overall the game was OK until the last level. For starters, it took me a few minutes to work out what the hell I was supposed to be doing. It seems Robo freezes in spot while you wait for the bad robot to climb into his diplodocus neck, robotic machine. You cant skip this bit which sux for this reason; Once you've killed the robot by standing in the middle and shooting at the red things on the neck when it's shooting its lasers at you; the robot dies, it plays a video and then you have disarm the bomb going off in one minute. You walk to 8 different machine's and choose which code you think de-activates it. If you get 3 wrong, the whole lot restarts and you have to do them again. I thought I might find the correct codes out first, write them down and then restart the level and get them right. But nope! After waiting boringly for the robot to start up, I finally got back to the bit to disarm them, and what do you know, codes aren't the same! That really sux when you can't finish the game without LUCK on your side. There is no skill I could find to it other then a good memory, you just have to be lucky to get through it. Other wise the clock runs down and Robo says, ""OH, S###"" and the whole city blows up. Yet some cop is still alive to say ""I wouldn't want you on my team, go back to the police academy"" then you have to wait too long for that robot to start up again when you start the level again and for me, I have no patience, i want to get into these things instantly, not be made to wait.

OVERALL:
The game was fun to begin with. I thought it was cool. That was until I clocked it. And realised it has no replay value. Once you beat the game there is nothing to do. Why it lets you save it after you've beaten it is beyond me, cause all it does is lets you see the crappy 2-second ending of a TV report and then goes back to the main menu when you load your saved game. What's the point of that? You can go back and re-do missions you didn't get all the stuff for, and maybe when you do that and get them all 100% complete it unlocks something? But quite frankly I don't care if it does or doesn't, I'm done playing it. Once I beat it, I had no desire to play it again. It was cool while it lasted, but nothing to redeem it like other shoot em ups have had. Plus, something other then walking around shooting would've helped the game a bit. Like driving, boating, flying, something other then 9 levels of the same thing.

Something that I heard about this game was that they had ignored the movies part 2 and 3 and said this was like they hadn't existed. This was the follow up to the original movie. Honestly, I couldn't tell AT ALL. I didn't see anything that looked familiar at all apart from ED-209 and Anne Lewis of OCP. (so ignoring the fact she got killed in the sequel is reason enough to say that stuff is it?)

PROS
- Decent graphics
- fun quotes
- huge levels
- good controls

CONS
- sux without the cheats to stay alive
- levels can be too big to be bothered navigating
- no replay value
- no ending after completion
- no multi player mode
- not enough levels
- needed something other then just walking and shooting all the time
- Needs more guns
- No spike (that thing in Robo's hand)",negative

1654,"Bought these shortly after Christmas, and upon reading of the horrors of setting them up I found out myself just how heinous a process it is. Even after fighting for over a half-hour for the clamps that hold the cymbal posts to the drum kit to ""JUST...SNAP...JUST...SNAP..C'MONNNNNNNN SNAAAP!! GAAAUGH! %&#@!"" with and without powertools (one of which never fully did snap 100% together), they worked beautifully, truly adding a new dimension and surprisingly seemed to make drumming a little easier for this non-musician to do-it-up more like a real one. Infatuated, I played for hours everyday for about a week straight before getting distracted from playing for that entire next week after.

The start of having these cymbals for that third week... was every optimistic-cynic's nightmare. Having known about the terrible setup, and still choosing to trudge on. Then experiencing the setup, and still going forward from that. Then experiencing a blissful 7-days of newfound drumming glory... to suddenly having DOUBLE-HIT!??

For no obvious, apparent, or investigative reason, my cymbals started double hitting any moderately-hard hit they registered. Which, if you do your homework, a lot of the disgruntled reports over these cymbals are about. If you just want to play and don't care about your score (and your score multiplier) then you won't care that this seems to be an unfixable and common problem with these.

But I, for one, also am now hanging my head low in mourning of what-was for a beautiful 7-day stretch, and what-could've been with properly designed cymbal accessories.

[PS.  Also, feel free to assume that it's just me and my cymbal pack (and dozens of others out there) and trudge onward with your purchase! Best of luck to you, honestly, because they're sadly a great addition.]

***EDIT #2: Originally I had posted an edit about how I attempted to take mine apart and found that it was missing necessary wiring so that it could never be fixed, well apparently those first few pages I found about fixing these cymbals were wrong, or else I just didn't know exactly what to look for in the guts of my broken cymbal that kept double-tapping in-game. After peeling off and realigning the wire and ""stickum"" to the proper place that they weren't in the first place to where they belonged, this double-cymbal pack only gave me problems with how the vice grip holders that wouldn't ""SNAP!"" would eventually drop my cymbal posts and I'd have to pause mid-song to readjust them--but this was very rarely, or only after extended disuse.

IN CONCLUSION: Since the pricedrop on this pack as well as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-Band-2-Triple-Cymbal-Expansion-Kit/dp/B001G57Y02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock Band 2 Triple Cymbal Expansion Kit</a>&nbsp;went into affect in late 2009, I had upgraded to the Triple set and I must say that the apparatus-es (apparati?) that hold the Triple set together seem so much more cooperative that even though I'm having a much more difficult time adjusting to now having an extra cymbal, I might've bought them again solely for the more-cooperative cymbal posts clamps/clips--it really is THAT much better of an experience with the Triples.",neutral
1655,No replay value and a boring subpar game to start with.  Traded it right back in for another game.  Waste of money.,negative
1656,"""Wings Over Vietnam"" is a lackluster survey sim that kept the Rotten Review guessing - mostly shifting from extreme fun to extreme disappointment.  WOVN uses the tried-yet-not-quite-true flight-sim engine pioneered in ""Strike Fighters: Project 1"", a visually stunning display of cold-war era fighter jets at war.  WOVN would fill the wide gap in flight sims unoccupied by even half-way definitive attempts to depict the air war over Viet Nam.  However, in its attempts to be a lite-flight-sim, WOVN kills virtually any attempt to make a good try of that particular conflict.

""Saigon; I was back in Saigon.""

WOVN allows you to fly for either the big air services at work flying combat from the Yankee end - fly for either the USAF or the Navy (including the Marines).  The game allows you to fly missions in the markings of any of a number of airforces, or fly ""careers"" for the USAF or USN.  In its stock form, however, you cannot fly for the enemy.  Flyable aircraft are those that can be expected by anybody who's read the slightest about Viet Nam - the Crusader, Phantom, Skyhawk or Intruder for the USN (or Marines); Thunderchiefs, Super Sabres and more Phantoms for the USAF.  The flight-sim engine here is very flexible, allowing for tweaking and modding by a dedicated community of SFP1/WOVN fliers for whom ""Falcon:AF"" offers either nothing or too much.  Thus, WOVN amounts to MS/CFS for fans of supersonic air combat - a virtually open source simulator as flexible to the needs of simmers as the effort that those simmers are willing to expend to mod it.  Want to try other ""century series"" fighters?  If somebody's done it, you can fly it.  South Vietnamese fighters like the F-5?  And while you're at it, why stop at 1969 - go for an F-14, maybe even an F-16.  You can add planes to MS Combat Flight Simulator, but that game doesn't allow for smart weapons or much in avionics.  Graphics are gorgeous - with Phantoms in both USAF camo, and USN gull-grey; Super Sabers in natural metal;  Control surfaces move; weapons like rockets and missiles are satisfyingly fiery, as is in the end of anything they hit.  However, all that flexibility and accessibility comes with a price.

""The horror, the horror...it ain't that scary"".

WoVN is hobbled by its stalwart unwillingness not to challenge those who play it.  Aerodynamics are simple - planes don't stall, and maneuver pretty much as you'd like them to.  This isn't just dumbed-down, but positively brain-dead.  Would it have taken that much to give us at least recoverable spins?  Instead, the jets of WoVN are cooperative - each carries gobs of excess thrust, and benignly maintains altitude during prolonged ACM, allowing Phantoms, Crusaders & Super Sabers the ability to duke it out ""F-16 Style"".  Take-offs and landings are a snap, even those on aircraft carriers - would it have been that difficult to model at least challenging carrier ""traps"" like those in the ""Jetfighter"" series?  And weapons?  Forget all that talk of the Sparrow missile as a cranky underperformer that required the launching aircraft to maintain constant illumination of targets it couldn't hit anyway; the Sparrows of WoVN can hit whatever they're pointed at, even if you're not (pointed at them, that is) - basically, these are 1990's fire-and-forget AIM-120's dressed up as cold-war era SARH AIM-7's.  To give some balance though, the Sparrow was theoretically effective against non-maneuvering bombers - and if the MiG-21's and -17's that fought our fighters in VN were as non-maneuvering as the ones in the game, then even the real Sparrows might have stood a better chance.  While Migs in WoVN may get into some serious dogfighting, those at stand-off distances will do their own impression of ""The Light Brigade"" and gamely charge into your waiting missiles.  The internals are also a mixed bag - systems aren't comprehensively modeled.  I liked how the pad-lock fleshed out the interiors of each plane - but nothing inside actually works.  Guages and screens are mostly for show.  Targeting data and your vital flight data are represented by simplified readouts (course, speed, alt) at different ends of the screen.  Early on, I grew confused as to which of the two data streams represented my plane.  In the end, their both just numbers, as opposed to analog gauges that are easier to read using peripheral vision.  There's something wrong about a flight sim that defies even the laws of simulated physics; as much, there's something wrong with a simulation of combat that's so eager to please.",neutral
1657,"not very good. 2k14 was 9,000,000 times better and Goldberg isn't in it so it bothers me. would recommend just getting 2k14",negative
1658,"I have enjoyed (to some extent) every Myst game that preceded this one.  As a kid, I played through Myst, tried to play through Riven (there was a stupid bug that wouldn't let me get to a very crucial plot location), and, in more recent years, went through the other three titles in the series.  Although Uru was odd and occasionally frustrating in its quests (especially in 'Path of the Shell' where solving the big puzzle requires finding little hints hidden in really random places) it was, in the end, a rewarding experience.  Though I have not yet finished 'End of Ages', I am  thoroughly disappointed.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the worlds don't have the vivacity that they had in previous games.  Even Riven was full of living things, movement, and atmosphere.  Though this game is full of the series' trademark beauty, any life to the art seems purely incidental.  Anything that looks cool generally is just there as a decorative touch rather than seeming like a living part of the landscape (and mystery) of the ages.  I think the worst loss in this regard comes in the joy of seeing the way aspects of the environment eventually played a part in the adventure.  In every Myst game before this one, there would be objects and locations scattered across the ages that you might see, but not know the reason for.  As you got closer to solving the bigger puzzles, these aspects of the environment would come to life, and suddenly everything was connected, and it was generally pure genius.  In each age in 'End of Ages', I found large contraptions and interesting locations that were, if anything, minor stops along the way.  There was no moment where everything came together (Myst 3 was by far the best example of these) and it makes each world just seem boring in hindsight.

The worst thing about this game, however, is the tablet.  When you start exploring the ages in this chapter of the saga, you find mysterious creatures that respond to a stone slab located in each age.  You can pick up the slab, draw on it, and drop it.  In most locations, once you step away from the tablet, the creatures will take it and react to what is on it.  In each age, solving the majority of puzzles involves drawing various symbols on the tablet.  Unfortunately drawing on the tablet is difficult unless you're an MSPaint master or something and generally you'll need to either copy the symbols to paper or memorize them.  Often times you'll think your drawing is close, and the game won't accept it.  Often you'll find this out fairly quickly and try again, but in certain instances you won't know that the game hasn't accepted the symbol until you travel to a completely new location.  Sometimes the creatures will even take the tablet and put it somewhere else you've already been in the age.

I am nearly finished with the game.  The plot is interesting, and for that reason alone I will try to complete it.  I just wish the staff could have looked back at what made the first four games (and Uru) great and cleverly utilized those elements to end this fantastic saga.",neutral
1659,"Wii Mote, and the Lightsaber, what'd be a better fit(besides a wand)? Heck, the 'mote even looks half way like the glowing sword, so you'd think this would be a no brainer, right? No, you would be wrong.

 From a controller standpoint, Force Unleashes' combat should be percise and fluid, using your hands to mimic force powers and lightsaber attacks. Krome Studios prefers the Alzimers approach of 'wild wiggling', the same low-quality efforts that most Wii titles are plagued from already. Throughout the 8 hr (really!?) experience, you'll be treated to the linear level desgns with bland color schemes, while you randomly wave you're arms at the inginite army of brain-dead stormtroopers. All planets are intitally the same, the enimes' textures are so horendous, it's hard to tell them apart, just random isles of thugs, with one jedi at the end. The bosses, jedi's at rave, follow the hack-n-slash gameplay of the levels, only to be finished off by choriographed quicktime events(which are one of the only high points of the game). The only time I was a true bad-ass was  when the game is in cinematics? I can't be one on my own accord?

 When a game gives box quotes on how 'you can choose good or evil', I was thinking allong the lines of havin that desicion more than once. The story was carefully thought out for a Star Wars game, or even movie, but when the cut-scene animations have characters with no emotion and such stiffness, it felt as if I was acting out a movie with action figures.",positive
1660,"I love final fantasy. I've played them since the Super NES days. So I'm really into the lore and the worlds. I've also played MMOs since 1999, starting with Everquest and dabbling (briefly) in World of Warcraft.

That said, this is a very generic MMO and poor excuse for a final fantasy game.

Having played Final Fantasy 13, which came out years ago, I knew what Square Enix was capable of in terms of presentation. I was hoping for incredible voice-acted cutscenes. I was disappointed. The cutscenes look like early playstation games and its accompanied by a wall of text. Don't get me wrong, I love reading and my favorite final fantasies are 7 and 8 which require a TON of reading. But this game just didn't have a compelling narrative. And again, the cutscenes were SO underwhelming.

I also feel like the Heads Up Display is a copy and pasted version of World of Warcraft. Sure, its a HUD and it works, but it feels recycled. Even the way you go about quests - kill 3 birds, gather stuff - feels a lot like any other mundane quest in any other MMO. I found myself mindlessly clicking through them after a while. I didn't care about the characters giving me the quests or completing the monotonous tasks they required.

The class/job system is definitely a strength of this game. I like that you can essentially switch classes whenever you want. Unfortunately, I just can't see myself playing this game long enough to unlock them and diversify my character. The community also seemed to be thriving. I saw players in every zone enjoying the FATE battle system (a glorified zerg in one particular portion of the map).

If you like the MMO formula the way it is, this game might just work for you. It features incredibly familiar design elements and if you're even somewhat experienced, you'll be able to dive in head first. If you were hoping for something revolutionary or groundbreaking and set in an awe-inspiring Final Fantasy world, you might be left disappointed.

To my defense, I have friends playing this game and they were really looking forward to me playing with them. And vice versa. I tried to like this game and I will continue to like final fantasy. I just don't particularly care for this rendition.

Play at your own discretion.",positive
1661,"This is now Gaming Headset #6 for me. And it will be my last. As much as I love gaming almost all day EVERY single day, I now just have to many Headsets. And in the end, it always brings me BACK to my Astro Gaming A40 Wireless System. One of my rare returns to Amazon was a prior purchase of the Ear Force X12 Gaming Headset and Amplified Stereo Sound. Didn't work out of the box, had a MISSING port to even connect...Not the greatest start. I never reviewed them as I felt it was simply unfair to give it a 1 star rating when it was possibly an isolated circumstance. However, it was unnerving enough to made me order the Astro set.

  Opened these and notice at the onset how utterly CHEAP these feel. The comfort was sub par as well (for MY old head). To me, and compared to my other 5 headsets, these feel like they may literally fall apart just putting them on my head within a month? I was going to list all the pros & cons but with this particular headset I think I need to cut to the chase. I do NOT like them! I wanted to so I would feel better about my earlier pair. Which reminds me....these were NOT paired either. Good luck if you try using the included instructions too since they are wrong and you will be visiting search engines online to find a forum with help there.

  Buzzing. I have it, but on mine it comes and goes???? NO idea why, and to be honest I am so annoyed I quit bothering researching the cause. I want to game, not wrestle with technical issues on a pair of cheap feeling as well as cheap SOUNDING headphones! Oh yeah, the sound....Bass seems so lacking I simply find that alone not suitable for serious gaming. Now that is a really BIG deal too since ordinarily I find too much bass really annoying as well. But these? I mean, it reminds me of an old tube type radio from the 1050's. Just lame (to me anyway).

  Cut to the chase is this. TERRIBLE ""instructions"", cheap build quality, buzzing that comes & goes, NO realistic sound reproduction, not set up properly out of the box, $150.00 plus? Not for me. I REALLY want to give these 1 star in case once again, I just got a ""bad set""? But fool me once, fool me twice rule and I still feel it possibly unfair to do so. I will go 2 stars but PLEASE understand, that I would buy ANY other headset before these. The have the feel & sound that you may expect if they were included FREE with some game you bought. That is MY opinion anyway. I will tinker with these when I have time to waste and see if I find any solutions to issues that plagued me. But only when I get bored and tired of gaming with NICE headsets I own and have absolutely nothing better to do.",negative
1662,"I got Battlefield 4 when it was released. Yes, I already know that's what happens when you buy a game when it is first released but for it to be this bad? They should have just delayed Battlefield 4. It is actually a great game but because it has so many problems, it's terrible. When this game is working, it is the best FPS I have ever played but 1 out of 10 times just doesn't cut it. This game has a lot of problems.

If you like to accurately shoot players for 4 seconds, close up, when you are not suppressed and that player is being suppressed and getting hit from your teammates, and he turns to you, shoots you with the same exact weapon you have, kills you with 3 bullets when it took you 27, then this is the game for you. That is exactly what happened to me. In fact, I have shot other players in the head from point blank range well before they shot me but for some reason, I still get killed. No it's not my internet and it's not me. This game is that bad. I can tell if I'm getting killed because of my mistakes or because of this crappy game and the majority of the time, it is because of this game. What is the point of playing it if you can't even kill anyone? And the bullets follow you around corners as well. I would get behind cover well before the other player was able to kill me and still get killed.

I've tried playing single player. I do not play it much and one of the reasons is because I've read from others that your save file gets deleted. In fact this happened to a friend of mine. Whenever I did try to play it, I would get kicked out. Paused it, left my room for a while, came back and got kicked out of the game. Next time, playing it and all of a sudden the application closed on me... again.

When the game first released, I was being kicked completely out of the game more times than I was actually playing it. It was so bad that even after you press the Options button to go to the main menu, the app would close. There were other problems as well but that one was the biggest one (for me anyways). They patched it and... I was not being kicked from the game anymore. I still get kicked out at times but it is way better than before. It does not happen much. I am patiently waiting for the patches. Despite its problems, I went ahead and bought premium anyways because I knew I was going to be playing this game for a while and that's still true. I continue play it.

I would not really recommend this game AT THIS TIME. When it gets better, I will change the score and update the review but right now it is bad. I do like it playing it but because the game is unplayable the majority of the time, I don't really play it much. Sometimes I can't stand it because it's so bad. Buy at your own risk. If you can deal with the problems, go ahead. Again, the game is actually great but its problems make it bad. I would rate it a 5 out of 5 if this stuff didn't happen so much.

UPDATE: 10/25/14

They have released a few patches since I wrote my review. There have been some good changes but not enough to make me recommend this game. It's still bad. I have good internet and everything yet I still have problems. The last update seemed to produce even more problems with the game such as movement (getting stuck in doorways, grass, etc.). Like I have stated when I first wrote this review, if you really want this game and can deal with its problems, go ahead and get it. However, I recommend getting it at a low price. Coming to think of it, it's best to rent it if you really want to play the game. With the game in its current state, I wouldn't really recommend spending an extra $50 for premium. And for those that will say that it's me and/or it's my internet, try to remember that just because your copy works doesn't mean that everyone elses does.",negative

Playing this game just likea gamble. I see some walk through online. The player just walk next to the enemy without being seen! So unreasonable! How dare a new guy doing something like this! By common sense no one will do such thing. So for most players, there is only two way to finish this game. First is spend countless time to kill and hide the enemy one by one.

One of the Best Games...Ever!  ...made better!

Still just as fun as I remember, but made more so with BG2 character options.  Good times, good memories, and still a great game.  Well worth it when on-sale.  Not so sure about full price.  The advanced screen size for new monitors is a plus, but the old limitations for routers -- cannot support 2ppl behind a firewall sucks!  Needed to use hamachi to to a v-network and use TCP/IP to make the connection work.  If you're all solo ppl behind your own routers, then no worries.  NWN was the first to eliminate that problem.  Also sucks that a MAC user purchased through Apple App store cannot use Steam for chat unless you buy a game (used G+ Hangout to solve this one).  But that's a Steam problem, not BG.  Great game for a sale price.  Had a few quicksave glitches, but so far, so good.  Have not tried any mods yet.  Great potential there (pack mule = savior of inventory boredom!), but with all this change, if it's full of bugs, it'll be a buzz kill.  Will update if it turns ugly.",negative
1667,"My husband loves Combat Flight Simulator 2 (Pacific theater) and really likes 1 (also European theater), so he was dying to try a Battle for Europe sim from Microsoft that would have graphics more on poor with the CFS2. Unfortunately, this simulator seems more like a step sideways, or even backwards, in terms of graphics quality and neither my husband or I enjoyed the missions. It also took us going through all three of our newer computers (all powerful, and one made in late 2012 that is extremely powerful) to find one this would load on despite the older simulators working fine on all of them. Even then, playing could be glitchy. I wish they would have done more with this, as I really loved the European missions on CFS1 myself and would have liked a new variation them.",positive
1668,"I was really looking forward to the release of Dragon Age 2 and after completing the game after 65 hours I was so disappointed. It seems like the game was rushed out the door with little concern on what they were putting out. Here are my observations of the game.

The game graphics look great but the play area has been greatly reduced to take place almost entirely in the city Kirkwall. Seeing the same areas over and over again just gets tiresome. And the recycling of the same area over and over again and just blocking off some areas with doors that don't open just plain lazy.

Combat was interesting with the acrobatic leaps and jumps performed by characters in combat but that's about as far as it goes on the good side. On things I didn't like was the fact that opponents explode like rotten fruit when killed. I didn't like the unending waves of enemies that pop out of the ground or literally drop from the sky usually next to your mage in the middle of combat.

Skills and inventory system, I liked the skills available in the skills tree but I don't like the fact that you have to click on each skill tree to see what skill are available and you can't do a side by side comparison to see what each one does. I didn't like the fact that some skills and spells are not available to all my mages forcing to take some mages who I just didn't want but couldn't take them because they couldn't heal.

The inventory system I just hated the fact that you can't change your companion's armor. Yes Isabella you do need a bath because you have to wear the same clothes for 10 years. I hated the category of junk that is literally just junk since when did a pair of torn trousers become treasure?

I really hated the conversation wheel more than once I found myself saying that is not what I wanted to say. Also it seemed like the choices I made in my conversation had absolutely no impact on anything that occurs down the road.

Which leads me to the romance options in the game, why give the option of flirting with someone and then they are not a romance option. It seemed the romance is not in-depth as it was in Dragon Age Origin. You have a couple of cut scenes and then that's it. I just hated the fact that you couldn't talk to your companions except at certain parts of the game. I also hated the fact that you couldn't get your companions together in one location and couldn't talk to them unless you went to their base location.

The quests which were a lot were a mixed bag of mostly go here and kill someone or get something. The plot was somewhat interesting but I had no choice in the matter. When I took up solidly for one group I still ended up fighting both groups to me it didn't matter what choices I made things were going to end the same. This means the game has absolutely no replay value if everything ends the same.

The entire game seemed like a complete failure and that the full intent of Bioware was to get something out the door no matter what and capitalize on the success of Dragon Age Origins. Looking at the system stats on the boxes tells the story Dragon Age Origins requires 20 MB HD space while Dragon Age 2 required 7 MB HD space, nearly 1/3 the size of Dragon Age Origins and it shows.",positive

1670,"This is definitely one of those games that are difficult to rate. What is does well, it does REALLY WELL. What is doesn't do well, it does horribly. KoF XII is definitely a mixed bag. Before I start, I will definitely recommend anyone interested in what this game has to offer to wait until KoF XIII. Otherwise, keep reading.

Once again SNK Playmore reinvented the franchise, for better or worse. The fighting system and the controls are some of the best ever in a fighting game; any fighting game, just pick one. Controls are very tight, being just about as responsive as they could be in a 2D fighting game. The new fighting system allows players to be offensive or defensive and still be effective, since it kept the dash and roll moves but also introduce counterattack and intercept moves. In addition, the fighting has been sped up a bit, making for a more up-tempo pace (to my liking). Lastly, they have added a ""clash"" feature in which two attacks of similar strength and timing repel each other (a la Weaponlord and Soul Calibur). The fighting system is definitely the strongest point of the game.

The graphics are also excellent. The new sprites make the characters look incredible (although they all suspiciously look like they're on steroids). In a way, it reminds you of Street Fighter 3 or BlazBlue, but the visuals in KoF XII look better and there are a few more characters. The animation is very smooth and the sprites were very nicely done. The only minor complaint here is that when the characters are in a close-up the sprites look a little pixelated. Doesn't hurt the animation though. The backgrounds also look great, although they are a little devoid if life. There are a total of 22 playable characters, although some of the fan favorites (like Mai) are suspiciously absent and some teams (like the Art of Fighting Team) are incomplete. That's definitely nothing like Neo Geo Battle Coliseum in terms of characters, but that's still more characters than some KoF XII 2D competitors (like BlazBlue).

And now, the bad. It's sad to say but I suspect that KoF XII was a rush job, especially for the consoles. For a game with such high production value, why does it not have any game modes other than Arcade or Versus? Where the hell is the Survival mode? How can you have an SNK fighter without a Survival mode? There isn't any. Also absent from this game is a story and an impossibly hard boss character. Basically all you do is fight a few team matches and then the game ends. This seriously reduces the replay value and makes you wish you were playing Mark of the Wolves (which has incredible replay value). This is definitely the worst part about KoF XII. For a fighting game, especially one with such excellent controls and play mechanics, this is completely unacceptable.

I have also heard bad things about the online play although I have not gone multiplayer myself. The lag is supposed to be incredible and there are no players to even fight against.

Verdict: I give the game 4/5 stars in the fun department. This is a fun fighting game that has great mechanics and the controls are super tight. When you actually want to pick it up and play some of it, it is incredible.

I give the game 2/5 stars overall. Two great ideas in this game are trumped by the lack of game modes, a boss(es), and a story. They took a great concept, rushed it to consoles, and destroyed whatever they were trying to accomplish. They had an idea that could have become a legitimate contender in the fighting game genre but they blew it.

Recommendation: if KoF XIII turns out like what SNK Playmore originally wanted KoF XII to be, then I definitely recommend not buying this game and waiting for KoF XIII instead. If you still want to play this one, rent and do not buy. If you are not a KoF fan, stay the hell away from this one!",positive

1672,"I bought this game because I wanted to play a game that was intriguing and mysterious. Well, it turns out that this game is frustrating at best, because of its linear play. This game doesn't allow the player to do anything out of order, which results in time-consuming wandering back and forth between locations, or praying that something different happens the 100th time you visit a location. I found myself very frustrated with the narrowness of this game, and don't recommend it to anyone. The only reason why it gets 2 stars is because of the environment is very realistic, and one gets a good feel for early 1900's life, as well as the fact that the music and acting are actually done quite well. However, some sound bites cut off right in the middle of a sentence, which has the player wondering what was said. Finally, there are misspelled words and factual errors, such as the World Series in 1901. This game isn't very good.",positive

1675,"EA has demonstrated the ability to master a sport when they put effort into it (NCAA Football, Madden, NASCAR Thunder, FIFA). So it's appalling (but probably financially successful) to see them slap out half-hearted efforts like F1 Career Challenge, Knockout Kings and the NHL and NBA series because they know they can cut costs and production because the hardcore fans will ensure a profit alone.
Similar to the NHL series, they add a few gimicky features to appeal to the console crowd but take away more specialized features like adjustable AI, car tuning, race length and individual stats. The graphics are slightly upgraded, but the framerate, draw distance and control are poor. The engine sounds actually cut out when you turn the wheel!
It's clear EA used old code and slapped together some poor cutscenes with bland presentation (which is an EA strength). It's like a bad expansion pack for F1 2002.
The worst new features include a ""hot zone"" where you score EA cards and points for driving fast through a designated portion of the track. The screen gradually turns red the faster you go (think of the ""bluring effect"" in the horrible movie ""Driven""). And various EA cards pop up and distract you on screen when you overtake and take corners properly. Very distracting and childish. Console racers will never compete with PC sims, but at least give us the option to try.
The big career mode is a joke as you virtually have no customization options. Race length, damage, AI and even pit strategy are all set. You cannot even determine a tire compound!!
My recommendation is to get ""Grand Prix Challenge."" It is probably the best F1 racer ever to hit a console and it has terrific controls and graphics. Then wait and see what Sony does with the F1 license when Formula One 2003 comes out. I have a feeling they will take it very serious because of it's exclusivity and the uproar that would be caused in Europe if they screwed this up. The bottom line is EA would never treat the Madden franchise like this, so why should we tolerate it with the other sports.
Memo to EA...Loyalty is an important quality and one your customers exhibit enthusiastically to all your products. But if you cannot get better quality from all your development houses then at some point that loyalty will erode and more upstart companies will peck away at your bottom dollar. It may be 20 years from now, but this industry is fickle and your fan base is young, transitional and more acceptable to change.",positive

1678,"I've spent a good deal of time with the SSF thanks to a friend who owns one. I even went so far as to order one from Amazon despite it being out of stock with no in stock date listed. I actually ended up being grateful for this as it gave me the opportunity to spend some quality time with the controller and it changed my mind.

Yes, all the glowing reviews are true. It's a joy to use. It's comfortable, light weight, easy to set up and it really is universal. HOWEVER, the library available for iOS and Android games is pathetic. I highly encourage all potential buyers to visit the SteelSeries website and take a look at the lists yourself. If you find a worthwhile selection of games you think you'd enjoy playing with the SSF, then go for it. If you're like most of the rest of us, there simply aren't enough titles on iOS and Android combined to warrant the price tag for this controller. The list may appear long, but quantity does not make up for the total lack of quality titles.

I realize that this controller isn't all about mobile gaming and it does work flawlessly with both of my Windows PCs and my Macbook Pro. And here comes another BUT.. But, I already have several wireless Xbox 360 controllers which with the help of a $15 wireless receiver ALSO work flawlessly with both of my Windows PCs and my Macbook Pro. $80 vs $15? Not a tough choice here. The Xbox 360 controller is easily the current favorite of console gamers and most of us already have at least one of them hanging around. Heck, even if you don't have one, $48 to buy a new one including the receiver is still much more affordable.

I really wanted to love the SSF. I really, really did. But until it is more widely supported by mobile game developers, it's just a really expensive portable controller that is unfortunately only a novelty at this point. With Gameloft solely supporting the Duo bluetooth controller, the SSF loses a significant number of the games that I'd even want a controller for in the first place. I'll check back in 6 months or so and see how the library of supported titles grows and if I see even a handful of my favorites there, it would be hard not to buy one. It is also in dire need of a price adjustment. There's no way it can compete when it is nearly twice the price of it's most expensive competitor.",positive
1679,"In all honesty, this game would have benefited from being single player.  The fact that there are people all around you doing the same thing you are cheapens the feeling that you're actually doing something that affects the world. I'm being praised for killing a vicious beast, but I turn around to make sure I've gotten all the loot before I leave, and I see that it has respawned. It's just makes everything I'm doing seem pointless.
The dungeons are just straight shots with very little--if anything--to explore. In Skyrim and Oblivion, I could spend more than an hour in each dungeon going over every little crack and crevice, making sure I've picked up everything worth taking and just enjoying how well designed they were; they were much more fun when I was taking my time to get through them.
The game is beautiful, yes, but honestly, that's about all it has going for it. Don't get me wrong, the game is fine, and I like mmos (like Neverwinter, it's free to play on the xbone, it's great) it just isn't very immersive, which is something you need for a true Elder Scrolls game. But that's because Bethesda wasn't the one to develop it.
In short, unless you really like mmos, I'd skip this and wait for ES6, it's about time for them to announce the next one.",positive
1680,Very noisy,negative
1681,"I went into this game knowing that it was a slower paced, more platform-focused Sonic game. I've heard people praise this game for its superior level design over the Wii U version, and I've read comments like ""The Wii U version is a mess, but the 3DS one is great!"" It's also pretty much a sequel to Sonic Colors, which is one of my favorite games.

Well, I'm here to tell you that it is not a more platforming-oriented Sonic game, and it does not have good level design.

What I'm trying to get at is that the game is not a very good game.

I'll be completely honest, the first world was incredibly fun. I've read about how Sonic is slow and controls awkwardly, but that really isn't the case at all. Sonic controls smoothly and it feels fluent and satisfying, at least in my opinion, and it's a welcome change that I hope returns for future Sonic games. Unfortunately, though, the game's level design goes downhill as soon as the first boss is completed.

So, the game uses ""wisps"", which return from Sonic Colors. In Sonic Colors, they were neat little power-ups that you could use every once in a while, like a drill to dig through the dirt or the laser to shoot through levels. It didn't overstay its welcome enough to earn ""gimmick"" status because the levels only rarely relied on them, the rest of the game being pure platforming. While it wasn't a contributing factor to why I loved Sonic Colors so much, I didn't mind it in the slightest.

Unfortunately though, they manage to absolutely ruin any enjoyment from an unforgiving amount of levels in Sonic Lost World. First off, most of them control pretty poorly. The asteroid one, which turns sonic into a floating asteroid and destroys anything in its path, controls so horribly that it can get borderline unplayable at times. Sonic will just slide around like he's on ice and you'll find yourself falling off of what would otherwise be an easy platform to jump on. If you only had to use the asteroid powerup every once in a while, it wouldn't be that bad, but some levels in the game require you to use it for the majority of the 15 minute+ level. The same goes with the drill power-up, which returns from Sonic Colors. In Colors, you would use it for maybe 30 seconds at a time to get from point A to B, but in Lost World there was a level in the underwater-themed world where you literally used it for almost the entire time, doing almost nothing but drilling through whirlpools in the water. It was monotonous to say the least.

Another huge problem with the game is the amount of ""puzzles"" that you're required to ""solve"". You'll start a level wanting to run to the finish line, but you're presented with two or three locked power-up boxes that can only be unlocked by slowly pushing snowballs or giant fruit into holes in the ground or rolling snowballs onto a certain set of switches. I know it's kind of ridiculous to judge a game on what I expected it to be as opposed to what is presented, but levels like these are just boring and lazy. I don't think there's a single soul out there who wanted multi-chamber switch ""puzzles"" in a Sonic game.  This problem is featured at its worst in act three of Frozen Factory, which has you pushing snowballs onto switches for a painfully long amount of time. It's probably the worst level I've ever played in a Sonic game.

There are also parts which require you to kill a certain amount of enemies on-screen in order to continue. It was fine in some areas, but it was just lazy and boring in others, like parts where you had to sit there and lock onto two or three giant enemies over and over until they were all dead. It really just felt like a way to artificially extend the length of the game and it was unbelievably boring.

Oh, and there are pointless motion controls that work in some place and not in others. I didn't mind it in one of the later levels where you ride on a rocket and tilt the 3DS to steer it, but I did mind it in the special stages where you have to pick up your 3DS and spin around your room like an idiot to steer. You won't be playing them on a bus or in a car, believe me.

The game has a system where if you die a certain amount of times in a level, you can burst an item box which will either destroy nearby enemies or let you fly across the level, kind of like in Donkey Kong Country Returns. I never wanted to use them because I wanted to finish the level myself, but I would always find that if it were located next to an enemy that you had to lock on to, Sonic would automatically fly backwards and lock onto it.  It was incredibly annoying.

Also, the entire last world was just a rehash of all of the game's bosses. There was not a single original level, except for the final boss.

On a slightly positive note, the game features an online multiplayer section which lets you race through levels with people around the world. It's fun, but it can get a bit laggy sometimes.

Overall, the game had so much potential to be great but it has so many problems that it makes the whole game below-average. It's not horrible, but it isn't very good either.",negative
1682,"I know I should have listened to other reviews saying this game had awful controls and lot of repetition but what can I say, who doesn't love a sexy woman as a main character?

*Spoiler Alert*

There are times where you are positioned to either snipe with a bow and arrow or defend against an army with a cannon.  Don't get me wrong that sounds awesome but; the controls are way too impractical.  I am not complaining that the game is hard by any means just the controls are really sloppy and do not enjoy a game where the player has to adjust due to ugly game mechanics.  If you can tolerate the horrible controls then by all means get the game if you cannot then do not even think about getting this game.",negative
1683,"I'm a fan of the show and I remember playing this when I was a kid, though my memory on it was fuzzy. I decided just for kicks to pick it up again ( it would serve as a reprieve from all of the DBZ and Naruto fighting games). After playing for about a half hour i remember why my memory was limited with this game, I probably didn't play for long because it sucked. The game modes are limited, the tutorial is a pain in the ass and confusing, and the controls are god awful. the only redeeming quality is the ability to play as your favorite character and even that is bitter sweet with the controls. It's a bit painful to see an awesome series get stuck with this crappy game.",negative
1684,"I have to say as soon as I started playing this, I was also severely disappointed. It is no way near as much fun as the original. As mentioned in another review, the whole point of HP Lego 1-4 was using the stylus to cast all the spells, and in this one, you don't even need the stylus. You can use it to change characters, spells, and during dueling, but it's not necessary since they provide you the keys for use of the use.

The graphics are quite poor, and with the concept of the stylus gone, this game just isn't as fun. The concept is basically the same though, go through every level trying to collect as many studs, do spells to unlock new areas, and collect the hats, red legos, and unlock characters. I guess the only thing I do like more about this one is that the game allows you the option of saving more frequently since each section is broken down into multiple sections. You can also leave some areas by choice, not because the game moves on. This can be helpful if you still want to explore.

Otherwise, this game is a huge disappointment compared to the first, although I don't think it's as poorly done as Pirates of the Caribbean Lego, but probably about second since I have both Indiana Jones and both Star Wars Lego on top of the original Harry Potter one. In the end, if you're a fan of the original, you probably won't like this one as much.",negative

1687,"I gave this controller a solid go and really wanted to like it. It  honestly is very similar to the OEM Xbox 360 controller yet slightly skinnier. Buttons all seemed to be placed proper and responsive and overall felt decent for a 3rd party controller in my hand. However, there is a massive draw back to this beautifully well crafted controller..........pinpoint accuracy with the joysticks absolutely sucks!!!!! If you are a casual to hardcore gamer, be warned, this controller is not for you. Light casual to the rarely pick-up-and-play-a-game-and-be-done gamer will probably not see or feel much of a difference other then the joysticks to the feel are stiffer.

As an example I play fifa. I don't just play fifa I play fifa on all manual settings which anyone who has played with these settings or does, knows that the slightest directional move makes a big difference. I thought to myself that maybe it was just fifa being overly touchy? wrong! I put in Forza and got the same thing. To break it down lets think of this as 4 directional path stick to a stock xbox 360 controller 18 directional path stick. Imagine each path changes the direction ever so slightly were as the least amount of paths mean the large the directional path gap. Trying to point the stick in between sometimes works but usually goes with one or the other. For the gamers that care about their gaming, BEWARE!!!!! and stay away from this controller. For all other gamers who don't use this exact type of directioning or for the games that don't have or require it this isn't a bad controller.

I am giving it 2 stars as it has a nice feel and seems to be a solid controller all around, if it wasn't for those d@m joysticks!!! Hope this helps anyone looking to buy this model",positive

1698,"I played DII for a long time, on and off, and eventually raised a sorceress up to level 80 something after about two years.  Like any game, it grew stale and I moved on to other things.  I think I would have given the game a four star out of five (with the expansion).  It was innovative for the time, I enjoyed leveling up my toon, and it was fun.  It wasn't the type of game that could keep me glued to the screen for hours and hours, but an hour here, a level there, and for what it was I enjoyed it.

Then comes this game.  I guess I was expecting something.. more?  I refused to play the beta, since I think it can detract from the fun of launch and trying a new game.  I anticipated a similar type of experience to DII, however I thought they would obviously refine and update the experience.  I have leveled my main toon up to mid 20s, and here is how I feel the game stacks up:

1)  Its the same game fundamentally as DII.  The graphics vastly better, but you are still locked in to an overhead view with high resolutions surroundings.  I was looking for options to change the camera, zoom out, do anything... but they never added any of that.  The environments look good, but its the same as DII - you go out into a randomly generated plane, scattered with the odd monster lair, groups of mobs, fog of war, and teleporters back to town.  You have acts and bosses and lots of loot to choose from.  Its primarily the same thing.

2)  They did away with the talent trees and replaced them with abilities you get as you level.  You assign an attack per button on your mouse and then get others you can use on 1-4 on your keyboard.  The good thing is you get access eventually to all the abilities and can choose on the fly which ones you want.  No more placing points into trees where you get 2% more damage for frost spells or getting stuck picking abilities that you later regretted.  You also don't place any ability points - its all on autolevel.  The thing is... I liked the old system.  My build was mine, and I looked forward to that level to place a point, or in three levels will get this ability, etc.  I could map out how I wanted to make my toon.  Now its all automatic and the only choice I have on my dude is whether its a she or a he, the name, and what ability I want to use for whatever fight.  Its much more like a common action game with very watered down RPG elements than an action RPG.

3)  Same old grind with your attacks.  I tend to use the same attacks... over and over and over and over.  For me it has gotten stale much faster than I thought it would.  I think that is because its basically DII with enhanced graphics and a crappy leveling system and DII came out 10 years ago.  I played that game to death, and I guess I just expected something more.  The story is very low key and there really isn't much else there.  Its fun to smash mobs over and over or blow them up or what not, but thats all this game really is.  It was more enjoyable 10 years ago because it was relatively new then.  Now it seems almost a step backwards.

4)  The Server.  Holy smokes I was blown away by this and is the sole reason why this game gets 2 stars instead of 3 for being just OK.  You have to log onto a server to play this game.  I understand blizz wants to data mine whatever you do online, and obviously protect their product from piracy, but I honestly don't understand why they went this route.  Some people say they wanted to go the multiplayer route more with DIII.  The problem with that is the multiplayer is going into public games and pressing two buttons with a 1-2 other people.  Its ok I guess for about 3 minutes... but then I just left and played my own game.  Others say they wanted to use the online auction house.  A decent idea, but I really don't know how many people will find that all that attractive.  You get loot so fast, and level up, and get better loot that before you know it that rare item you got two days ago is now junk.  Why spend money on those items when in a day or two you will not need it?  But it still boils down to having to log on.  And I still have to wait sometimes to get on because the server is full.  For what in my book is a single player game.  Then I get on... and you get the server restart in 15 minutes BS.. or the game is laggy as heck and your toon jumps all over and it glitches out.  If your like me and just want to turn it on and blast the snot outa baddies for about ~ 30 minutes (until it gets boring), then the whole server thing is just an incredibly over the top DRM system.  I thought maybe the chat thing was something that would make it worthwhile and was treated to Superbubbaz and Cooldoodz23 performing 12 year old wow like trade chat - that was definitely not a positive addition.  I don't see anything they added here thats a bonus and not a detractor.  If a DRM subtracts from the pleasure you get out of the product they put out - that god awful mess for HofMM6 is a good example, then the DRM is a failure.  This isn't as bad as that, but its close.

So overall its a two star game for me.  Logged on tonight... went about 5 minutes and just logged out and wrote this review.  Its only a few days old and I feel like I've been playing it for 4 months.  Too bad I guess, I was hoping they would do much more with this game.",positive
1699,"There are some great features of the xbox one, like the ability to add a tv tuner and/or run hdmi passthrough for whatever device you want, like a cable box, or even a Roku.  But this is about the most unpolished experience I've ever had, and it's been out for years.  If you buy an xBox One instead of a PC because you think it's gonna be more reliable, think again.

1.  Downloaded games sometimes just won't work.  xBox Fitness was a prime example.  Downloaded, launched, and it just hung on the disclaimer screen during launch.  Uninstalled, reinstalled, and it worked fine.

2.  Of course, once I got xBox Fitness up and running, I realized that the Kinect still has a long way to go.  The field of view is just stupid narrow.  I'm 6'3, and standing 8' away cuts off my head and don't even think about getting more than one person in frame at that distance.

3. You can just leave the console and walk away, and it will go into something like a sleep mode, allowing you to resume your game right where you left off when you return.  When it works, this is awesome.  Problem is, it never works.  The game always seems to freeze when I return.

4.  The controller pairing also gets thrown out of whack when you resume from this sleep mode.  While the controller will work fine in the xBox dashboard, once you're in game, you'll have to turn it off and back on to repair it so that the game recognizes it.

5. The side snap feature could be nice, but it's a nightmare to use.  I've been fiddling with it for a week and I'm still not sure how it works.

6.  You're forced to install the game before you can play (at least with most games).  For Madden '15, for example, it took about a half hour to install, and when it was finally done, I still have to insert the disc to verify ownership.  Stupid.  You should be able to transfer ownership to a digital copy that is tied to your account so you don't have to get up to swap discs every time you want to switch games.

7.  The controller is great, except the thumbsticks have a small basin on the top, and the edge of that basin basically collects dead skin and whatever else is on your thumbs.  It's nasty, especially when it's someone elses skin that's in there.

8.  The graphics are a step up from the 360, but in most games, I don't really feel like it makes a huge difference.

9.  Paying $50 a year for multiplayer seems more and more ridiculous when I've literally NEVER paid for multiplayer on PC.

I've been a PC game for years, and just recently sold my dust-collecting 360 to buy a One.  It's not on par w/ PC gaming.  I got it because I felt like I  would have access to more games, especially sports games...but in reality, the only gaming experience I couldn't get on the PC was football, and Madden is horrible, so it's not like I would have missed that.  FIFA is avail on PC.  NBA 2K is avail on PC.  There are lots of racing games...there are FPS, strategy, RPG, etc.  I should have followed my gut and got a Steam Link, but oh well.  My gf will enjoy being able to pause live TV again, and I do love Forza.  Other than that, I'll probably stick to the PC.  It's more reliable.  It's faster.  Better graphics.  It can take advantage of my 21:9 monitor.  Game sales are more frequent and lucrative.  There's better controller support.  Because xBox One threw away the one thing consoles had going for them (rock solid reliability), they are really nothing more than a cheap old PC w/ a proprietary front-end/game system.",positive
1700,"this game was hyped to the point where you feel almost obligated to buy the game.  it is good that they spent so much money hyping up and marketing this game because if they tried selling it on substance alone it would fall flat.  square enix and the final fantasy franchise in particular, are now just getting by on their past accomplishments.  for those who have yet to play the game i will try to give you an idea on what this game is like.  for the first 20 or so hours of the game there is no exploration whatsoever.  you will spend your time watching cutscene after cutscene detailing a story that i personally felt to be melodramatic garbage.  until you advance pretty far in the game your abilities are few and far between and most fights you will just let the ai control your characters.  the ""dungeons"" are basically long hallways where you walk straight ahead constantly with a battle every few steps and a cutscene almost as often.  there aren't any shops.  you purchase everything at terminals and the items just appear in your inventory.  and did i mention that your eidolins are basically rip offs from transformers?  i tried very hard to enjoy this game and i just couldn't do it.  bad story and annoying characters you don't care about do not make a good rpg, no matter how pretty the graphics are.

i had quite a bit bad to say about this game so i wanted to get that done first and now well talk about the good.  the graphics are stunning.  in fact, there are so many cutscenes that look out of this world that it almost merits playing the game just to see the beauty of them.  ever since final fantasy 7 ive really enjoyed the cutscenes in these games and in that department this game doesnt disappoint.  after playing the game for a while, at least 10-115 hours i did begin to enjoy the combat since at that point, it did require a bit of strategy to succeed.

Edit: i would like to add that the game does get better when you reach gran pulse, around 20 hours in.  the battles do become more complex as you play and near the end, the game is much better than it was in the beginning.  however, after dragging myself through over 20 hours i just don't have it in me to pick this game back up and finish it.",positive
1701,"Please read reviews. There is no mention that this item does not work with modern tv sets. A simple mention and I would not have purchased. I couldn't tell you if this gun would work or not because I don't own an older tv to test it with and I'm not putting one out those heavy sets in my kid's room. Make sure you read the reviews for this item, it will not work on flat screens. The seller does not bother to mention this, hence the 2 star review.
Got my son an older set and tried this gun again. It was back to the good old days... For five minutes. As I "" tested "" it out for my boy while he waited impatiently to try the game he's been wanting to play for months now, I was slaying birds, when out of nowhere... Nothing. No clicking sound, no response on the game. I could hear something rattling around inside. I took it apart and sure enough a piece is broken.

coming off on their own.  I thought perhaps I just got a bad pair, so after trying them on the standard
Sony controller, and my others, I replaced them, only to get the same results.  If they could stay on,
they might offer a slight benefit.

This is the second xbox 360 controller I have and both started to drift mostly to the right within a short time of usage. It is very noticeable when playing war games and you are scoping and aiming. It is mainly the left stick only. Both controllers are the same, one is a couple weeks old and the other is about six months. There are complaints all over the internet about this problem and so far there is no fix for it. People have tried different things with rubber bands. I can't believe with all the technology out there and so many complaints that there is no fix. I have ordered  AAA-Shocks (Analogstick Aim Assistance Shock Absorbers and from the looks of them, I think I am 99% sure this will take care of that problem because they fit around the stick to increase the resistance and I am hopeing that they will bring the stick back to a neutral position. I will report on the AAA's if they indeed work.",positive
1707,"Although I'm not too impressed of the cover art of this title, but what I found to be much unimpressive is the horrific gameplay.  For those that don't know, the famous Italian actor name Fabio Lanzoni is the model posing with the sword on the game's cover like a bad-ass and its a common marketing tool to get kids' parents (including a horny middle aged housewife or single mother - lol) to waste their hard earned money on a mediocre game for their kids.  For starters, the character's (Kuros) sword attack is very short range and awkward (you don't stand a chance against any melees when neccessary).  There are other alternative attacks like projectile spells, but they deplete your magic very quickly and they must be conserved for the elemental boss battles of which swifter than lightning strategies are mandatory.  Weapon upgrades don't help as much and you can't perform a jump attack which is neccessary for those multiple airborne creatures that must be warded off.  The jump configurations are useless and I thought it was me, but its hard to steer while in the air. The game's music is pleasing and so are the graphics and color schemes.  The game's objectives are simple and to the point - defeating all four elemental guardians who stand in your way to obtain the iron sword you must use to defeat the evil Malkil in the Icefire Mountain.  To progress through each level, Kuros must find a golden artifact for each Animal King for each elemental domain and they will help you advance toward the domain so he can find the neccessary magic spells and armor/weapon upgrades (range of the weapon still sucks) needed to defeat each Guardians.  As I said before the controls are very flawed and adding on the the difficulty is the absent ""after hit"" invisiblity, fast depleting life bar, difficulty in seeing whats ahead before its too late due to the screen's influent pace, and limited continues.  Iron Sword looks like it could've been a very good game, but due to the mild success of the previous game and the cover art of the game, it misleaded many gamers and kids wasted their money and time on this mediocre title.  The game designers are laughing their heads off and collecting their money while many frustrated gamers like myself are biting the controls as early as level 1 because we die from multiple enemy attacks due to the cumbersome controls.  The game designers didn't want to repeat the same formula as simular themed great games like The Legend of Zelda, Gauntlet, and Castlevania, but I think they took three steps back by trying to emulate an average game like Capcom's Ghosts & Goblins, but they failed.  I wasted a good $5 on this title and I can't take it back.",negative

The first thing I noticed is they got rid of some of the fun things from the original, like the lighter and the chalk. The inventory system is quite clunky and I found I had to stop everything just to change weapons or get the canteen. Speaking of the canteen, I thought that sort of a ridiculous way to get health. I much preferred finding medkits or medicinal plants and having the choice of buying them at the end of every level. The combat is a lot cooler, at least hand to hand, than in Infernal Machine. I like that there are punch combos and such. The way that the enemies can withstand about 15 slices from a machete is pretty incredible to me however and it got really tedious after the first few guys, especially after they began to have guns more often. The controls are really clunky as well, especially when you just want to adjust yourself a tiny bit. You would tap a key and Indy would swing 90 degrees.

1717,"The Wii and Star Wars seem like they could be made for each other.  Just the idea of wielding the Wii-mote as a lightsaber is enough to send any gamer, Star Wars fan or not, into total happiness.  Star Wars The Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels appeared as if that dream could come true, but alas, it doesn't.  The first thing you'll notice is that the game follows the art style of the CG-animated Clone Wars film and TV series, and the game manages to successfully capture the look and feel of both, and it looks good to boot.  The battles however are sadly short lived, and while they appear to offer a good amount of fun when things start to get going, it won't take you long to realize that the controls are impercise.  You don't wield the lightsaber so much as waggle it around, and this may not be so bad were it not for how impercise the controls end up being.  This ends up overshadowing how shallow the gameplay really ends up being, as there isn't much strategy to really implement, which leads to some repetitiveness.  Still, the arenas are large and well-designed, and the voice acting and dialogue are well done to boot.  That aside though, the game still ends up being quite the disappointment.  All in all, Star Wars The Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels is a disappointing endeavor that is worth a look for Star Wars fans, but other than that, the game fails to deliver the goods.",negative

1723,"This game at full price new is a waste of money. First, there's a real lack of a good plot line to it. It consists mostly of shooting endless streams of enemies with only a meager plot line to each mission.
The graphics are pretty good. The major drawback is that the environment isn't distructable like other FPS games. So you can't shoot crates or other things to discover hidden items. IMO, this is a real drawback. You also can only interact with certain items in the environment that are integral to your mission.
The plot line in the game really doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. You never really know *why* Jack is going after the guy he's after except for money and there's no real good explaination why Jack's client wants the guy found.
I was absolutely shocked when this game ended after around 10 missions. Not only is that way too short, it ends in a particularly unsatisfying abrupt way.
This game did deserve its M rating though, it's perhaps one of the most graphic games I've ever seen in terms of blood as well as some of the language. The dialogue in the game is rather good IMO. Some of it is wry humor that I found amusing, although it really doesn't add anything to the game at all.
As other reviewers have said, this game just has an expansion pack feel to it. There's also a limited amount of environments that the entire game takes place which I think is a drawback. There's even one level where all you do is shoot enemies, you can't move around because there's no place to go in the environment. That reminded me of old arcade games, not modern FPS.
If you like NOLF, you'll probably want to play this game, but don't expect it to be near as good. As for Sierra's contention that it's a ""prequel"" to NOLF2, prequels usually have some explaination included in them that clears something up in games that have already been released. This game doesn't do that at all.

This is The Evil Within.  Regardless of the settings, you will most likely not have enough ammo or health to complete a level and have to go back to a saved game. This is POOR GAME DESIGN.

One example is that I had a quarter of my health left and I KNEW there was a cut scene coming where a monster would take a quarter of my health, so it was IMPOSSIBLE to continue.  I've never had to go back in any game as much as a did with this one and load a saved game.

The sad thing is the graphics are really nice and the monsters are cool,  but you better resign yourself to playing certain sequences over 3o-40 times, including sequences that aren't even boss fights.

Plus the game is very buggy and the presets keys for the weapons DO NOT WORK.

I play video games to have fun.  This game was anything but fun.  You are so worried with staying alive throughout an entire level that there is no fun.  The easiest level of difficulty in this game was way too hard for me.  I was constantly dying or having to use artifacts to stay alive, it was ridiculous.  I stopped playing this game at the final boss battle of level 2, because I couldn't beat it.  Yes, level 2.  There are 14 levels.  I can't imagine the boss from level 14.

Other than the difficulty, I hated that I needed to search out power-ups, artifacts, ect.  I just want to go through a level and kill a bunch of people. Is that too much to ask?

If you thought you would like this game, or are considering buying it but don't want to fight for you're life through the 14+ hour campaign, buy NJ3.  Much better game.

I start up the game. Alright, let me go into practice mode and check out the vocal harmonies... wait, where's practice mode? Not there. Sweet, we're already off to a good start. At least I can invite my friends online to join me in the new career mode. Wait, where's the online-- are you kidding me? Am I really asking a lot here? These are basic things that I assumed would be in the game, not only because they seem like natural things to be in a $60 game, but also because they were freaking there in Rock Band 3!!

OK, what DOES Rock Band 4 have that Rock Band 3 doesn't? A slightly different career mode, gimmicky guitar solos (which won't work if you have a Guitar Hero guitar instead of a clunky Rock Band guitar like any sane person), your friends can now vote on songs (instead of doing the nice thing and letting the vocalist choose so he won't be forced to sing a song he doesn't know), and you can sing different notes that sound good on hard and expert vocals (which only really serve to make the easiest instrument even easier.)

Harmonix, you could've just been honest with us in the first place. You could have made this a $20 or $30 download and labeled it as something to tide us over before the real Rock Band 4 gets released. Ever since you labeled this Rock Band 4, you have had to lie to us over and over to get around the fact you didn't sell us a full game in the first place. You refuse to answer questions on social media if the answers don't paint the game in the brightest light. Your employees put 5 star reviews of the game on Amazon to bump up the score.

OK, I'm somewhat happy you're adding in things later, instead of taking the Sims 4 route of being stubborn and saying ""No, we're not adding in infants whatsoever! Time, like money, needs to be budgeted, except that you can't take out credit for time!"" However, let's say you DO add in online and practice mode. Rock Band 4 still won't really be a better game than Rock Band 3. Unless you add in a keyboard update or something incredible, all I can say to you Harmonix is that you first disappointed your fans, and then you made your fans wait to be less disappointed.

But you're adding in adjustable breakneck speed, and you've already added in a bunch of other small features. However, I'd still say 5 marginally useful things don't make up for dropping an entire instrument and dropping 3 instruments' pro mode, especially if I have to wait for basic features to be re-released.

Please don't ruin rhythm games; I love music and rhythm. People said rhythm games died because of Guitar Hero's needless sequels. Please don't give them a reason to point at Rock Band and say ""Hey, even Rock Band's long-awaited sequel was just a money grab too!""",positive

I disliked this one for this reason. The gameplay I didn't enjoy either. So this one was out of me. I own the game and prefer the other 3, this one was the crappiest of the lot.

1738,"I bought this game with high expectations. Aggregates scores from professional reviewers put Might and Magic among the highest rated RPG's ever for the DS. Unfortunately it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations; in fact there were moments in the game where I seriously loathed it.

**** THIS SECTION INCLUDES SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****
My first issue is with how completely linear the game is. Not only is the plot linear but even your very footsteps are linear. There is almost no freedom in movement. You move from space to space in a very stiff fashion. As with every RPG that has ever existed you start the game at level 1 and work your way up. I leveled my character up and finished the first section of the game only to be given control of a NEW character starting back at level 1. After leveling this one up, I got a third character again at level 1. I Leveled up and was given a FOURTH character at level 1. By the time I reached my FIFTH new character the game was kind enough to start me at level 7 for whatever reason. You can only ever level up to 10 maximum which again puts serious limitations on what you can do in the game. Finally, let me say that fighting an opponent several levels higher is nearly impossible and several levels below is very easy and often boring. All of this adds up to the most claustrophobic and constrained RPG I have ever played.
**** END OF SPOILERS ****

I haven't played a lot of RPG's on the DS because very few have gotten better than mediocre scores so maybe I'm out of touch but I did not expect to see load times at the beginning of battles. I think back to GTA on the DS which created an entire city for the player and still maintained an excellent frame rate yet Might and Magic needs a few seconds to set up a small battle. The combat itself is something I've never seen before in an RPG and it's probably the greatest strength of the game. The battlefield is essentially a grid that operates somewhat similar to Tetris or Doctor Mario. Get three creatures of the same color in a row and you can create a wall or a battle unit that can attack the opposition. There are also more powerful creatures that can be used to attack when combined with smaller creatures of the same color. It's fun for awhile but about halfway through the game it started growing tedious and tiresome. The game is sort of a hybrid RPG/puzzle but it doesn't do either exceptionally well and in the case of the RPG I would argue it performs poorly.

This is the most disappointing video game I have played since `No More Heroes' on the Wii which was another dud that got great reviews from professional reviewers. I never got into the story one bit. Switching from character to character only left me caring about none of them and the game committed one of the worst infractions a game can commit, it became a chore to play. I kept expecting that I would get past the slow start and the game would pick up but it never did and when I defeated the final boss I was pleased to put the game away for good. I really regret buying this one instead of the new Zelda game for the DS.",negative
1739,"I just want to lay some ground work and say that I loved the Cybertron games. They weren't the prettiest things in the world but the gameplay was great.

But, if anyone has played the previous Transformers game based on one of the movies, this is more of the same. Lazy, terrible graphics, poor controls, and a ridiculous difficulty spike in the second mission. Also, the voice acting is pretty bad, I continuously hear the enemies spouting the same phrases time and time again.

The gameplay just feels clunky. Between twitchy controls, awful land vehicle mode, and pretty dumb and ruthless AI.... this game pretty much lost all it had in its favor. I've gotten stuck on invisible barriers multiple times in the two hours I've played it. And getting hung up against a wall is very common as well. The gunplay is okay, but not as good as past Cybertron games due to awful hit detection.

In the graphics department.... what is this??? It looks like an early gen PS3 game (at best). The wall and floor textures are the ugliest thing I've seen in a game in years. And the vehicles you transform into? Yeah, they're pretty bad too.

The first level is almost like playing a children's game. Go here, shoot these guys, pretty easy. Level 2.... RAGE MODE. There are these little floating bots that shoot red laser beams that can kill you in seconds. I just don't understand what they were going for here. The little bit of fun I was forcing myself to have with the game was immediately stripped away when I encountered these things. After 6 attempts, I'm done. I'm gonna see what my local BB's return policy is or I'll throw it up on ebay. Hopefully I can salvage $30 from this scrap heap.

DO NOT BUY! Rent this game if you're curious. I wouldn't even recommend it for Transformers fans.",negative

1741,"I'm really sad to post a negative review after throwing so much money at these.

I'll start with the positive: the sound quality is above average and the mic is studio quality.  This version comes with multiple jacks that connect to the headphones themselves, meaning if you're swapping from PC to tablet to PS4 in somewhat rapid succession, you don't need to carry the cable with you.  Just leave the proper one where the device is and carry the headphones.  The over-ear cups also drown out enough noise that I couldn't hear my door being knocked on from ten feet away.

The negative: first, it carries a fair bit of interference, which isn't particularly noticeable when sound is playing, but in the absence of it is annoying.  I actually suspect it amplifies but is drowned out; using these headphones for a week (at low volume levels) gave me some serious tinnitus.  Second, the pictures don't really do it justice.  It's a bit like those cereal boxes where in small print they read ""photo enlarged to show texture"".  I have a very large head, and this headset, fully extended, doesn't fit it.  If I tilt it backward I can fit it around my head, but then it twists my ears.  I don't have particularly large ears, but they have to fold to go into the ear cups.  This wouldn't bother me, except that 1) I need to wear them at an angle to fit in them and 2) after a few hours of use it causes them to lose sensation.  When I take the headset off, they try to go back to normal, and it's...very unpleasant.  Finally, the jack meant to work with the PS4 controller is oddly shaped, and jostling it will cause audio to cut and crackle or fade out entirely.

So, despite this coming highly recommended to me, I cannot recommend it to others.  No headset I've used in the last ten years comes close my Tritton headset--even new Tritton headsets, which are just as uncomfortable and low quality as this one.",positive

1753,"The Biggest Loser is my favorite TV show, and Jillian Michaels is my favorite part of the show.  I was prepared to love this game no matter what.

I've had my Wii Fit since it first came out, but I've definitely falling into a rut and needed something new.

Pros
1. There is a nice variety of games.
2. It's great that it can calculate your calories burned.
3. Using the Wii Fit Board is optional.
4. I definitely broke a sweat (thanks to all the running)
5. There are clear instructions before each activity.

Cons
1. Too much running - I'd rather use a treadmill.
2. Without my entering my weight, I'm skeptical about how accurate the calorie count was.
3. I carefully followed the directions on several games, but had the same no response that other's have mentioned. I *know* I was doing it correctly.
4. There aren't many spaces available for the tips you unlock...it looks like you'd complete that goal rather quickly...and the tips I did unlock were pretty basic.
5. There was a nice variety of music...but I didn't like any of it.

I'm glad that I wasn't able to pre-order it (I'm in Canada) and instead had to wait and read reviews. After seeing so many bad reviews, I decided to rent it first.  I have a 5 day rental from a local video store and will probably return it early.

1755,"Ok here we go. First off this is my first delve into the xcom series but i have played through it to completion so its time to review. Let me also say that i bought this as a digital download on xbox one but i prefer to do my reviews here. I am no scrub when it comes to strategy games (long time rts player) and have been gunning people down on xbox since the beginning. At first xcom pissed me off, the difficulty level is very high even on lower settings at least in the first half of the game. If you make it past the halfway mark you will likely have an easier time towards the end but until then be ready to do a few restarts. The turn based game play, though not anything new, was a refreshing break from the normal day of fps and rts. The player models (when static) look pretty good and i liked that the characters appearances were randomly generated. Also the world map starting location and seemingly the non essential mission maps were also randomized making no play through the same. The story as a whole is kinda bland and there isn't any prologue to catch up players that didn't play the prior games leaving me feeling lost and without a purpose other than ""try not to die"". So if all was well at this point i would have given this game 4 stars, but then we get to the bugs. This game is beyond riddled with bugs both on the visuals side and on the game play side. The cut scenes featuring the random generated characters has a frame rate of half or less than the story cut scenes making everything feel very choppy and sometimes i would see incomplete loading of finishing textures making it look terrible. Some of the story cut scenes would have out of sinc sound to what was happening on screen, very annoying. I can get past a hand full of visual bugs but these were literally every few seconds making it kinda unforgivable. There are a few game play bugs like telling a character to move to cover and they get to within one block and just stop out in the open for the turn often getting himself shot. The enemies will sometime get stuck and fall through the map or just disappear, killing them. Objectives not being able to be shot even though you are standing on the objective just because the game thinks you haven't ""sighted"" it. There are a quite a few more to the point were i could write a book about it. The short of it is that this game had a TON of potential but needed another year or two of bug testing before release. I had the game crash while trying to load a mission 3 times during the campaign, luckily the auto save system works but its still a pain as the loading screens are VERY long. The final nail in the coffin was the final cut scene and up until this point i was at 3 stars for the game... i played the final mission, which is quite long, to arrive at the ending cut scene. The ending cut scene for games is very important, its the culmination of all your efforts being payed off with a completed story and some nice visuals...... Then the ending cut scene played with no sound, ZERO. Dead silence. i was so mad that i threw down my controller and went outside to smoke. I was furious. I still have no idea what the ending was about and i won't bother looking it up. This is the first time that i have seriously contemplated trying to get my money back on a game, games are art and therefore are not guaranteed to please you but they SHOULD AT LEAST BE COMPLETE!!! I payed $60 for 80% of a game when you take all the bugs and issues into account. The person that decided to push this game out the doors in this state has ruined it. Another year or two and you could have been golden! Now this just feels like a money grab.",neutral
1756,"I have downgraded  my score. It's OK.  I've been playing Fifa every year.  Why does the goalie in this game almost always catch a cross in the box or a corner kick?  There is something off with this game.  I actually lowered the time of the halves just to get these games over with.  The goalies in this game also make incredible saves.  I had 16 shots in a game and no goal, I lost 1-0 with the computer only shooting 2 shots on goal.  They always seem to score in what feels like a cheap way.

I am disappointing with this game.  It feels like a chore to play.

I think the defense is harder, which is a good thing. I think EA is trying to go in a better direction. But there is just something about this game that screams boring.  And the ball always seems to bounce the AI's way.  It's so frustrating that they went backwards with this game.",negative

1758,"Stella Deus is a tactical rpg from Atlus. The game plays very similar to past tactical rpgs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogres, and Disgaea. Unlike traditional role-playing games where the hero character, and the supporting NPCs who join him, can roam the roads, forests and lands between cities and regions freely, tactic games pretty much just linear road-links which takes a character icon from one marker to the next signifying a cities on the world map.

Like all tactics-based rpgs, Stella Deus uses job classes which can be levelled into much stronger ones, with class name changes included. This is done through constant battles and the exp gained from successful attacks (melee, ranged and magic), supporting actions, and use of items. Stella Deus has a way of creating high levels gear and weapons from current inventory which is pretty exhaustive in the amount of combinations can be used. Though some combinations just doesnt make sense in that some powerful weapons and gear can be made by combining a weak low-level item with a medium-level one while combining two high-levels can get a player a useless low-level item. As fun as the item creation system is this small flaw can make things frustrating at times.

The voice acting in Stella Deus is one the worst I've heard in games, so far. The people who did the voices for the hero, the supporting characters and some of the npcs I can only sum up as being below-par and just downright amateurish. It sounds as if the actors hired were just reading what was put in front of them without any sort of emoting required. It doesn't help that the story itself is pretty dull and uninteresting.

The gameplay itself is pretty much your standard tactics-style grid battle where the player positions his party as strategically as possible to gain an advantage on pre-positioned enemy units. After a few battles its really simple to figure out just how to position your party so that you pretty win every battle with little or no trouble.

All in all, Stella Deus doesn't match-up to the great tactics rpgs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre and Disgaes. It doesn't even come up to the same level as the second-tier tactics rpgs like La Pucelle, Makai and Phantom Brave. I'd recommend this game as a rental, but even then I'd only do so if a person really wants to try it.",positive

- The game looks cute and plays smoothly.
- No season pass/paid DLCs. Supposedly future additions will be free, although some kind of micro-transaction still exists.

Cons
- No single player, multiplayer-only.
- Repetitive generic shooter, nothing new, nothing exiting beyond the cute graphics, some of the weapons may give a fresh air the first couple hours. Tries to ""innovate"" with a few features like characters specials/abilities, no health regen, etc.
- Four simple game modes based on capturing areas/points, that's all you get, no attempt to create new and/or innovative game modes... oh, my bad, three game modes, the fourth is just a mix of the others.
- 10-12 players matches (yes, like it's 1995).
- Three maps for each mode, for a grand total of 12. Maps are small obviously as they just need to accommodate 10-12 player, don't expect Battlefield-sized maps.
- No customization beyond skins and aesthetic.
- No additional weapons, mods, gadgets to unlock. All maps and characters are unlocked from the start. Has a level system that only unlocks said aesthetics, that is: a completely useless level system.
- Ridiculous unbalanced characters, some will one-hit-kill you with their specials (some even with their standard weapons), others do so little damage their bullets/lasers just tickle the enemy. Unbalancing gameplay is expected form Blizzard though, ask any Starcraft 2 player.
- You will be bored after 5 hours of capturing the same area over and over. The only incentive to keep playing is to unlock the aesthetics and to ""master"" that one-hit-kill special from your character so you can get your cheap free kill from unsuspecting players.

This is the ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" from Blizzard: severely lacking in content, rushed, unpolished, unbalanced, over-hyped, quick-cash-grab game; but strangely this one gets praised.",positive

1764,"Crysis 2 is a big budget, big name sequel released in 2011; there should be something new and interesting here to justify the $59 price tag.  There isn't.  It is merely a competent console shooter that will be forgotten in a few months.

The reason PC gamers are upset is because crysis 1 was new and innovative and high end; and the CEO of crytek boasted that the Crysis 2 would have the best AI in gaming history,  and called it a ""revolutionary masterpiece"".  Customers have a right to be more than a little angry at being mislead.

The gaming philosophy behind C2 is different than C1.  Linearity and caged fighting has replaced the multiple approach multiple strategy of C1.  Occasionally there is a bit of choice, but it pretty much always boils down to ""Maximum armour & shoot furiously while ducking behind the hundreds of conveniently overturned cars"" or, ""Stealth along obvious path around everyone"". The suit functions are highly automated, reducing strategic choices further.  Needless to say,  the skill needed to master this game is minimal, and the replay factor is zero.

So why did Crytek make Crysis 2 on PC a mediocre console game and nothing more? The reason is the console limited amount of high speed random access memory and memory bandwidth available for the devs to work with.

PS3 and Xbox360 have a max of 512 mb available for video and cpu, and the bandwidth is low by today's standards.  HD Textures (well, kinda HD cause it gonna be at 720p or less) ect can be streamed by that old tech OK, but that means gameplay is linear and restricted.  As caching is extremely limited the game has to know where you are going and what the possibilities are.  Variables, player input, etc all add size to the needed cache (ram).  And without the needed ram, there would be a loading screen every 2 minutes.

So the number of variables and size of loaded environments have to be mercilessly limited. You are not part of a world that you can freely explore; rather you are an actor in a predefined script, a rat in a maze.  That's just the way it is.  Moreover, if you start adding kicking AI and realistic physics (not physX, but physics), the memory requirements go up.  Crysis 1 pretty much needed 2 gig (total video + cpu ram) as a minimum, Crysis 2 runs on 512 mb.

Right now, because all pubs are chasing the maximum dollar, all games are going to be coded for 720p with an online multiplayer component with' 512 mb and 6 year old memory bandwidth limits--which means all fps gameplay will follow the same rules.  Moreover, because online play is so important in the xbox revenue model, further bandwidth restrictions are imposed on game devs.

But why should that matter to a PC gamer?  Well, when a dev creates a console game PC port, all of the above restrictions will remain in place because changing them would require a near entire re-write of the code, pretty much doubling dev costs and that just aint gonna happen.  Which makes PC port fps as  derivative and predictable as their console progenitors.  And that is fine, just don't tell the world that your game is revolutionary and has the best of anything.

I hope this console generation ends soon, so devs can bring some new ideas to games that only more powerful hardware can allow.  Unfortunately, it looks like that won't be until 2015, and even then I don't think any of those future consoles will be cutting edge in anyway.  Everyone learned from Sony's including expensive tech in the PS3 in 06.

Edit: there was an interview with Tiago Sousa  one of the lead programmers for crytek yesterday which you can google.  He said """"My finger-pointing at Microsoft/Sony would really be on the memory side.  It's way too low, and the biggest crippling factor from a visual perspective. I would really like to see next-gen console platforms with a minimum of 8GB.""",positive
1765,"I have owned every Mario Kart game, and consider myself to be a bit of an addict, spending embarrassing amounts of time practicing things such as power sliding on straight aways and downing suckaz with simple items such as banana peels.  So needless to say, I was very excited for a mario kart game that would allow me to showcase my skills online, and relive memories with old multiplayer comrades who have since moved to other parts of the country.

Imagine my surprise when I put the disc in and discovered that there was no multiplayer grand prix mode!  Working in tandem to unlock new classes, tracks, carts, and racers had always been one of my favorite parts of Mario Kart, and it was something that Double Dash did to perfection, allowing up to four people to get in on the challenge.

I had invited the friend whom I played through all of the double dash grand prixs with over to do it again on the Wii, so after we found this out it sort of killed the buzz... but whatever, we had always spent a lot more time on battles than grand prixs anyway.

We found surprise again when we couldn't do a free for all battle!  After messing around with some vs. races on motorcycles we decided to ditch this game, and spent the night on the SNES, and playing bob-omb blast on double dash.

The bulk of my issues with this game can be condensed to three items:

-Lack of options
-Lack of skill
-Lack of creativity

Double Dash was filled with options, you could combine characters in various ways to get certain unique items or racer attributes. You could choose the number of laps in vs. races, and take your choice of three unique battle styles.  In Mario Kart Wii the lack of options is mind numbing quite honestly.  It makes the game feel as though it was rushed to production.  Why can't I choose how many computer characters participate in a battle or vs. race?  Why isn't multi-player GP available?  Why are there only two battle modes, one of which is hell of lame?  Perhaps most annoying of all... WHY CAN'T I CHOOSE TO TURN THE STUPID RACER NAME TAGS THAT SUBMERGE HALF THE SCREEN OFF WHEN I PLAY ONLINE!?!?!

The lack of skill required in this game was evident from my first GP race.  Every other Mario Kart game did a good job of making item boxes scarce, and the occurence of items such as blue shells and lightning very infrequent (although there was an OPTION in double dash to change this).  There are several tracks on the Wii version that are nearly unplayable because of the volume of items.  With 12 players, and the stupid items like the thwomp and lightning cloud that don't really help anyone... it just isn't racing anymore when there is absolutely no value to your place in the first 90% of the race.  Coming back with items is one of the great joys of mario kart, I understand that (I still have fond memories of hitting the super ramp on Mario Circuit 2 with a mushroom to cut a corner and jump up two places to secure first over ten years ago), but there is something else going on entirely in tracks like the Luigi Circuit on the Wii (which might be one of the worst mario kart tracks ever), where every racer gets ripped to shreds on every lap because of the overwhelming volume of items.

This gripe could easily branch into things like how the power slide boost, for the first time ever, is not controlled by the player (and I'm not talking about the manual vs. auto drift), but simply by the length of time you hold the slide, and how they reverted to the ""hold and wait"" technique of blocking items that existed in Mario Kart 64, as opposed to timing a reverse release to block such as in Double Dash, and how the ""get a boost when you are right behind someone for awhile"" time has been cut down to almost nothing... but I think I have said enough on this.

The tracks and items in general though... where is the creativity?  I'm not expecting the wildly refreshing array of tracks we were greeted with in Mario Kart for the GBA, or the slew of new items that required poise and tact to make decent use of that showed up in Double Dash, but there is nothing new on the Wii version.  Let me re-phrase that; there are a couple of new things, but they are quickly beaten to death via recycling (soooooooooooo many figure 8's), or in cases such as the mega mushroom, little more than repeats of other items (in this case, the star).  The half pipe thing is new... but I don't really see the purpose when it is faster to not go up the ramp?  And the motorcycles... who cares/if the drift controls were the same as in double dash no one would choose them for the cheap wheelie boost?

Then there are the lazy re-hashes of the classic tracks.  Changing the placement of item boxes, and other key features of the tracks (such as making the walls solid in the ghost valley track, and removing the rock throwing natives on the N64 DK track)... I just don't see the point.  I mean, I know that most people probably don't have every Nintendo console (sans Virtual Boy) within 5 feet of eachother in their entertainment room so playing Ghost Valley 2 on SNES isn't really an option... but seriously.  Some of these re-hashed classic tracks aren't even worth playing in the form they are presented here.

There are a few nice features.  Toad's Factory, Grumble Volcano, and Koopa Cape are amazing tracks.  There are a lot of karts to choose from (although the differences, as I can tell so far, seem to be negligible... unlike the kart selection in Double Dash where the differences were quite obvious).  And it's not like the game is unplayable, quite the contrary, it can even be enjoyable for short periods of time. As part of the Mario Kart franchise though, I just expect more.

I honestly don't know why though, as every big franchise title aside from Mario Galaxy and Twilight Princess has been like this.  No options, dumbed down game play, terrible online game options and matching features, basically just leaving a ton of potential on the table and all of my expectations largely unfulfilled.

This is easily the worst Mario Kart game, and definitely the last Wii game I pre-order.

Oh, and the Wii Wheel... don't buy extras of these.  They aren't worth the hassle.  After struggling with getting my kart to power slide correctly through two grand prixs I dug out the cube controllers (ps - why is there no option to configure buttons how I want? Or... better question, why does the GCN controller layout not match that of GCN Mario Kart when the only new feature is wheelies, which could easily be added onto the unused c-stick or d-pad or... even better, onto the L trigger that items are incorrectly assigned to!?)",neutral

1767,"This game is hard to recommend, even for hardcore fans of Ninja Turles (Hero Turles). This game is very short, bland, and frankly, incomplete. The characters are lacking in that personality that made the 1980s cartoon or the 1990 movie successes.

Steer very clear from this one, unless you happen to be a TMNT historian who wants to compare this game to all the terrible TMNT released in the 6th and 7th console generations. But you're probably not, so there's no reason to get it.",negative
1768,"I picked up Wii Play for five dollars at a local game store. That was a fair price, because five dollars is about all Wii Play is worth.

Pros (with a few cons):
Combat is back. This game would be one star material if not for its Combat clone, which is called Tanks. Unlike the hit Atari 2600 game that it emulates, this game doesn't require two people to play. In that way, it's actually better than the original.

Duck Hunt is partially back in the form of Wii Play's Shooting Gallery. However, Duck Hunt was a much better game than this. You're actually shooting targets and the ducks are there for bonus points. Furthermore, the game ends far too quickly. If you want to play Duck Hunt (which is far more enjoyable than Wii Play), hunt down a NES.

Cons:

The pool game only has 9-ball, and it doesn't even follow the accepted rules of 9-ball.

Find Mii hardly constitutes a game.

Everything else.

Wii Play was just a good way to get a Wii Remote when it came out, but by itself, it's potentially something you can enjoy for like ten minutes.",positive
1769,"If you do get it used, and I'm not a used game buyer.. this is not the game you want EA profiting from.

I got it for $20 @ Best Buy after using a reward zone certificate when it went on sale for $40. I wasted $20 and the certificate!

It has a cheating AI, terrible collision detection (impact engine at it's worst), it freezes and I've heard many stories of the save file corrupting after beating the last career mode stage. EA has absolutely no plans of fixing the bugs, don't be a sucker to them like I was. Game gets boring on Easy and is near unplayable on higher difficulty levels.
When you beat the AI, they block you off cheaply from keeping the ball, and when you tackle them you either don't win the ball or if you tap it away and they fall down, the terrible collision detection I mentioned will either trip you up or block you off, either way you're not getting the ball from them no matter how well you play, you just have to hope.
This is a typical tackle for you, and this was on EASY, it's worse on higher difficulties: [...]

I only kept it so long to get the trophies, but after trying to find Messi for half a day just refreshing the teams I packed it up and sold it so I didn't end up snapping the disc in half. I shouldn't have bothered using the online pass, cause there's only ONE online mode and it's a 5v5 timed match, no freestyle or other modes at all.
Maybe at $10 it would be worth it to play when you have some friends over, otherwise it's pretty much a cash grab by EA cause it has problems but they are pretty much done with it and don't care one bit about the complaints.",negative
1770,"I remember this game being fun. I recently bought it and its very confusing and a hard game to beat. Its fun at first, but then they add a stupid hang gliding test that just sucks. The game is tough and if you're into a challenge where you have to go though rings for points and land successfully this is it for you. You have to use differentiate speeds and elevations for certain levels. I would have to say this game is similar to Star Fox but I don't remember Star Fox being hard to play.",negative
1771,"First of all, I am always sorry when I ignore the reviews before buying anything from Amazon. The 5 star reviews totaled 43% for these headphones! Only 4 out of 10 people were crazy about them. But I wanted a 'surround' headset for games, that I ignored the reviews. I had gone to some independent review sites, which put these close to the top. Since it's Amazon, not much to lose.
Pros:
They sound very nice in stereo mode when wired to the controller
They are reasonably comfortable
They look nice, and appear well-made

Cons:
The wireless mode is awful - nothing but static and an occasional sound. I was 10 feet away from their unit that plugs into the PS4.
They fit tighter than my Bose Quiet comfort
There are 4 or 5 touch buttons on the outside of each ear phone - If you accidentally touch one, heaven knows what you'll get. Whatever it is, it  totally interrupts your experience.  You have to stop the game, remove the headset, and try to figure out which button you hit, and reset it. Some buttons don't reset, though. They cycle through endless options. After getting it set the way you think it might want, you put them back on - immediately accidentally hitting another button by mistake. Weird design.
They are way too expensive for what they provide. I own Bose Quiet Comfort, and they are worth every penny. I might keep these Turtle Beach ones if they cost about 1/3 of what they cost.
The ""quick start"" instruction sheet is huge. Which means - it ain't quick.
I have a couple of 'surround' games. I played through several scenes from several games trying to get the surround experience. I was never able to do so. The main reason I wanted surround sound was that in shooter games, I could never tell if the guy shooting at me was on my right, left or behind me. By the time I figured it out, I was a goner! That in itself was reason enough to return these.
There are very few games that recognize surround sound anyway, so in most cases, why bother? I expect in a few years, there will be many more games, and surround headsets will have improved quite a bit as well.
The pictures in the huge quick set up manual do not represent what is in the package. I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how I could have missed the large flat recharging station in the pictures. Turns out, if there ever was one, it has been replaced by a short round station. I suppose it works fine, but it sure confused me. For this price, guys, at least print instructions that are accurate. When it shows a clear picture of 'what is in the box', then the picture and What is actually in The Box ought to agree. Agree?
So lesson learned - don't buy anything that has a fair amount of reviews, yet can only get 43% to get 5 stars!",neutral
1772,"this is the second time I brought this game. The first time was for the PS3 which I think looks and sounds better however, the game itself has many issues. lets first start with  what is good. The city Fair Heaven is beautiful. it's very detail and lots of hidden ins and outs, you'll spend hours exploring especially trying to find all the cars. The sounds are fantastic. clank up the volume and drive through the many tunnels in the city and you will hear an orchestra of engines. They really worked hard to get every engine sounding like the real thing. The races themselves are engaging and challenging.

Now for the bad. The cops and their pursuit are best done when driving a low level car because when you get into the many hyper cars like the Bugatti or Zonda, the cops simply can't keep up. There's no pursuit soundtrack to amp up your heart rate. There's no pursuit breakers like in the original where you could drop a giant donut in the middle of the road. But worse, there's no penalty if you get busted other then losing speed point which can be earned back by driving dangerously. You will need to replay events to earn boost and other upgrades for EVERY single car including those in the Most Wanted list. Once you have about half the upgrades, the racing event become ridiculously easy. it's like the game gives up challenging you once you reach 50%. There's no longer a take down cam where you see your opponents crashing into a ball of fire and wreckage and damage to your car is minimal compared Burnout and even Driver San Francisco.

In the end, I just felt like I was doing a checklist. Find the Camero, do the event for the boost and off road tires, get the re enforce chassis, battle the cops and repeat.

Online it's chaotic. There are screens all over the TV and while there are challenges, you won't notice them because every time you get taken down, are new screen of meaningless stats of the guy who took you out fills your entire screen. if you are going online then it best when you have friends you know and just free roam and explore.

I could go on but it hurts too much. I was really looking forward to this game but NFS Most Wanted is a safety game. Not to bold not too bad. It's in the middle and that why I don't like it. Criterion Games has always been innovators and it saddens me to see their name on this. Each event starts with an artistic and at this mental cut scene. These scenes are by far the most interesting thing about the game but there no explanation for why they are there yet there so visually engaging, that I want to know why they there. Really this game needs a story and without one it makes the experience average and uninspiring.",neutral
1773,"For all of the hype this game is really boring. I thought it would be fun but its really drawn out and the controls are horrible. You have to use the bat mobile all of the time and I really could care less for it. The combos and moves batman has are fun but then if you press the wrong button guess who shows up the damn batmobile.

I was expecting much more and I am always trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing.
All in all disappointing and I will play when I am really bored.",positive
1774,"Stuntman is extremely overated.  The theme is interesting enough that I can see why some people defend the game so strongly.  Acting out stunts from your favorite movies is something anyone wants to do.  Yet poor design decisions and sloppy controls has made Stuntman much, much harder than it needs to be.  You MUST rent this game before you buy it, trust me.
I just don't like being forced to do the same, limited thing over and over again in a game.  You have to perform the EXACT stunts the game wants you to, in the schedule it requires, and the slightest mistake means instant death.  Hitting ANYTHING in the level, any building, car, or even a fence or sign, and you are forced to restart.  Fall behind even 1 second and the game only gets harder.  And speaking of time, I don't like waiting 20 seconds for the game to load after just 15 seconds of gameplay.  When you are forced to replay a level 50-60 times, I would estimate that you've got 10-20 HOURS of load time to sit through.  It gets old fast.
The game physics are extremely chaotic.  Collisions and jumps at any speed or angle can cause a flip or spin-out all too easy, and usually force you to restart.  Even minor steering adjustments can cause a spin-out and cost you a hard played level.  Hitting a small curb has actually flipped my car onto its back, more than once.
The levels are tight and restrictive, with most obstacles appearing suddenly from behind a hill or corner, with no time to react.  You memorize this game, not play it, and as you play each level encountering something new will most likely kill you immediately. There will never be that magic moment you find in games like GTA3 or Tony Hawk, when you've learned the skills to start improvising, reacting to new obstacles as you encounter them and making up your game as you go.  No sir, not this game.
Calling Stuntman ""difficult"" isn't accurate enough.  Frustrating, too restrictive, poor controls, and annoying are better descriptors.  I wouldn't even recommend renting this game unless you enjoy insane obstacles. Buy it with risk.",neutral
1775,"This game is not Joystick compatible.  I bought this game to use it with a joystick, but it would not register.",negative
1776,"I have finally played this.  With all of the bad reviews I avoided buying this.  Then I got for free, so I am playing it.  To put it as bluntly as I can, Gothic 3 is just not very good.

I'm running 2GB RAM and a NVidia GeForce 9800GTX 512MB.  So if my system isn't up to snuff then the problems are in the programming, especially since this game is 2 years old.  The first problem are the saving/loading times.  Can you call it a Quick Save when it takes 30 seconds or longer to process it?  And load times are horrendous.  I haven't clocked them but 2 minutes has to be the minimum.  Its a good thing that most of the game is easy, but it makes the few difficult areas unnecessarily frustrating since you play for a few seconds then wait 2-3 minutes for another shot.

Then comes the stuttering.  The transition between areas is terrible, often locking the game up for several seconds as you cross the invisible barriers.  Or it starts strobing after loading the new area.  Everyone talked about how this was supposed to an Oblivion-killer, but I never ran into these problems with Oblivion and I have a 256MB Video Card and 512MB RAM back when I played it.

Then comes the lie of non-linear game play.  It actually is quite linear.  While you don't have to play the game in the same exact order every time, there are only 2 ways to play the game.  Run across the whole map killing Orcs and animals, or complete the quests one at a time before being given a reason to move to the next map area.  This is non-linear in the same way Fallout was non-linear.  You have complete freedom of movement to anywhere on the map, but if you go in the wrong order either certain options are closed to you or your foes are more difficult than they should be.  RPGs like Fallout 3 are getting closer to non-linear (of course Fallout 3 suffers many of the same other issues discussed for Gothic 3, so its not really a recommendation).

Dialog: this suffers the same problem that so many other foreign games suffer from.  Instead of using a German that speaks/reads English, hire an American (or Canadian I guess) to interpret it from German.  Here in America we have contractions (you are is you're, I am is I'm, etc.).  Dialog without contractions is rigid & false sounding.  I'm also not a big fan of dialog that takes you by the hand and explains everything like you are a 10-year old.  And dialog is another place where the ""non-linear gameplay"" falls on its face.  You have no real options in conversation.  Sure you can choose the order you ask questions and make statements, but there are no choices on how to ask the questions or make the statements.  I am asking the exact same question to the exact same NPC at the exact same point in the game as every other player.

Let's see, what's left?  Oh yes, character generation and progression.  First, there is no generation.  Not even a choice of avatars or gender (not that I would play a woman).  I am not a big fan of spending obscene amounts of money for progression.  I haven't decided if they put too money in the game and use the progression system to control that (75 gold from a rebel agent for a worn-out weapon that only orcs can use?  And I have 10 of them from one battle!  But now I have to pay 2500 for a Tier 2 skill), or if they created the buy a level system and then overinflated the economics to account for it.  Either way I don't like it.

The concept behind the progression system is good for cRPGs.  Any time you have a game designed around a single character, you have to give the opportunity to have more than one area of expertise (finding a proper combination of combat, thieving and magic).  But this was not innovated by Gothic 3, and this is not best interpretation of it either, so I the only credit I can give is that it exists here.

Finally the story line, the plot, and the heart of any RPG...there is none to speak of.  Orcs have taken over and as a human you choose to help either the human rebels trying to take back their land or side with the evil orcs to destroy the rebellion.  Gee, that's original.  But at least they did it in a new and fresh way.  No wait, they didn't.  In fact, its about as typical as I have ever seen.

To summarize: Graphics - not even the best at its time of release, and down right plain by today's standards; Sound - nothing groundbreaking, dialog is poorly interpreted, and I turned the music all the way off after a few minutes; Story - played out, unoriginal, poorly executed; Programming - poor, unstable, sub par even in its day.",negative
1777,"This is one of those SNES games that makes me wonder how hardcore gamers were back in the 90's. It's freakin impossible.

1778,"Criterion Games, the developers behind the Burnout series, now heads this Hot Pursuit reboot to stir life back into the Need for Speed franchise.  After having much success with Burnout Paradise (and rightly so, it was a fantastic game even on PC), I thought they could do no wrong.  Turns out that I was wrong at that.  You'll find that I make comparisons from other games so if you do not know it, do not worry much about it.

Hot Pursuit's Career mode is split in two: Racer and Cop.  The design for the Cop career mode is very dismal and disappointing.  Much of the missions are very boring and leaves little to be desired.  Each time I had played through a cop mission, I found it so boring that I jumped right back into Racer career mode.  Wish I could comment on the multiplayer aspect.  Never tried it so I can't say on how it is.

The graphics engine looks okay.  Tons of reflections on all the cars.  Maybe too much.  Selections are nice.  All of the pricey and exotic cars are there and there are some of the classic exotics in there too, such as the McLaren F1.  But from there, it goes downhill.  There are very little you can change.  Texture quality has only two settings.  Shadows and motion blur can be turned on or off.  But there isn't anything else that you can adjust.  There isn't any anti-aliasing setting on it too, which makes many games look so much better.

Perhaps the biggest blunder is their multi-monitor support.  Both AMD and nvidia have multi-monitor solutions, dubbed Eyefinity and Surround respectively.  Both have certain methods on how to support either of these multi-monitor technology.  Back in Burnout Paradise, Criterion Games inquired the public on what they would like to see in terms of support on the PC.  One of which is a niche market device called TripleHead2Go, which enabled people to connect up to three monitors to a single video card.  Burnout Paradise has support for TripleHead2Go and its HUD elements can be adjusted accordingly based on this system.  When Burnout Paradise was played on Eyefinity or Surround resolution, the adjustment can also be made in order to make the HUD elements centered on the middle/center monitor.  In Hot Pursuit, there is none of that.  No option. No setting.  Nothing.  Those with multi-monitor setups will be sorely disappointed as there is only very minimal support for Eyefinity and Surround.  And by minimal, at the very least, you can get a wider view when using Eyefinity/Surround resolutions.  But that is pretty much it.  HUD elements in this game would be flushed to the left and right most edges of the screen on multi-monitor setups.  That means you cannot glance at your current speed, your power-up availability, your current place, the track layout, or your Bounty score.  It was expected from Criterion Games, who know of multi-monitor gaming during Burnout Paradise, to implement and support such technology or provide a method to adjust how the HUD elements are displayed.  However, when I filed a bug report regarding this issue amongst others out there, they closed the bug with the reason ""As designed.""

I give developers some leeway and leniency when it comes to supporting Eyefinity and Surround, especially if they have never used or supported multi-monitor before.  As such, games like Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, and Batman: Arkham Asylum all have HUD issues.  But once you've stepped into the world of multi-monitor gaming, your player base is going to expect you to continue supporting it on the next game.  Want to know how to perfectly support multi-monitor gaming as well as let people adjust their HUD placement?  Look at Serious Sam HD and Serious Sam 3: BFE.

As for the game mechanic and gameplay itself, there are some elements that reminds me of how Burnout Paradise played.  One of the fun things I do in Burnout Paradise is drift in curves.  Hot Pursuit has a few areas that exploit drifting and also lets people practice to some extent their drifting ability.  It's easy to start a drift and I do not mind this.  Many of the tracks are short and the only joy I had out of the game was playing the final track in the Racer career mode, which is 4x longer than the longest track before it.  Some cars are a hassle to handle.  But after a few runs, you get used to how it handles.

The audio is average.  Music selection is okay, but nothing substantial to note out.

Overall the game is very subpar.  I am immensely disappointed in Criterion Games for fumbling this up.  The lack of graphics options to truly fine tune the game's visuals make for a very static experience.  The game engine does not push PC rigs all that much, as a Core2Quad w/ a Radeon 5850 can run the game at 5040x1050 resolution at 60fps, if you turn off motion blur that is.  Since Criterion says that all of this is ""as designed"" then I say that it is not worth getting regardless of the price.

Verdict: Skip.",negative

1780,"I am quite surprised this game has so many good reviews.  I bought it recently thinking it would be a big hit with my kids.  Well, I practically have to beg them to even play it at all, just to make me feel like I didn't waste $40 totally.

Where to start?  The games are not intuitive to play like many Wii games.  It's frustrating to try to toss a ball or dart in a carnival game and not be able to do it without hitting the right buttons.  The games are very limited in scope---most have nothing beyond the one simple action to do---shoot a duck, throw a basketball, pop a balloon.  Once you master that, you're pretty bored.  There is little incentive to get better.  The ""prizes"" are basically small pictures of a prize.  The biggest prices make some sort of noise and can be turned around---major thrill!  I think of things like the trophies in Smash Brothers which really seem almost like toys you can touch.  The games are not tied together with the feel of a real carnival---they are just reached by signposts of their category, and the categories don't make a lot of scene.  I thought you would be able to wander around a virtual carnival, but no such luck.  Many of the game's features are confusing.  For example, when we tried to play a two player game, it took us forever to figure out how to use two controllers and not just pass one back and forth---you have to turn around a sign to do that, and it's not well explained.  Two player mode is pretty much just playing the same game with alternating turns, and you get no prizes or tickets in two player.

The main game my kids wanted most to try was the Skeeball type one.  It was hard to control and not very fun---in keeping with the rest of the game.

I give the game 2 stars as it's an interesting concept, and a few games were mildly fun for a while---balloon pop and duck shooting to name them!  Overall, I felt cheated and bored by the game, as did my kids.  I really wonder why all the reviews are so good.",positive
1781,"I expected a lot from Sega as they have delivered on almost every account of the ""World Series Baseball"" series (no pun intended). Also with the Dreamcast finally deciding to show its true ability, I saw stills of this game and was in awe. This very quickly ended as I first played the game. Oh my god, yes the graphics are amazing. That is where it ends. Players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs. But this cant save the game. The control is quirky at best, batting is a real hastle. Hmm, perhaps defense will  be better. No, quite the contrary. There is absolutely no fielding whatsoever. The ball flys in the air and the computer moves a player to the spot then u decide which base to throw too. Sound like fun? Didnt think so. Lets go try another mode. HA! No extra mode for you! We are presented with exhibition and season. Oh well, lets try playing a season with some of our friends. Nope, cant play on the same team as a friend. With lack of extras, poor control and lack of it as well, and no team playing, this game avois a 1 star with its amazing graphics. This game is horrid to play and I strongly suggest playing Tommy Lasorda Baseball for Sega Genesis over this game. At least you can field....",positive
1782,"The first Chronicles of Narnia game (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) was an amazing game.  Stellar graphics, seemless transition from movie to game, imaginative level design, excellent two player strategy, a level system for special attacks, etc.  Therefore, I was excited to play Prince Caspian.

I think there are a few things that ruin this game.  First is it not being linear.  Each level is open-ended.  Each stage is broken down into different areas that are re-accessible over and over again.  Items re-appear and you are asked with a prompt if you'd like to re-do the area.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea.

Second, most of the game is just finding the missing lever so that you can re-attach it to the crank.  There is an over-abundance of crank pulling, which takes 5 seconds or more of button mashing to complete.

Third, there are no special attacks. In the first game you were allowed to level up and earn special attacks.  Characters now are limited to three attacks or less, with very little variation. Lucy cannot even use her cordial to heal, Susan does not use the pan flute or the horn, etc.

Fourth, there are 20 or more playable characters in this game.  You cannot choose the character you want at any given time, but are limited to whatever characters they give you in each stage. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather play as the main characters and not as a tree, centaur, or Caspian's tutor.

Fifth, Huge Battles play out in the background.  They are just eye candy.  You can stand in the middle of a huge battleground and never be hurt.  The game is easy.  Involving button mashing to get through.

Sixth, missions are boring.  More crank turning and many  things in the game were not in the movie at all.

Seventh - The first game featured cast interviews and other interesting extras and movies.  This game lacks in that department.

The problem with this game was that there wasn't much to the movie or the book, so they didn't have much to work with in the first place; however, it could have still been a great game, if it played like the first.

I'm a big fan of the Chronicles of Narnia, but this game is nothing more than button mashing, crank turning, and major character hopping with characters I had no desire to be.  I recommend the first Narnia game over this one any day.

The Good:
Graphics
Sound

The Bad:
Gameplay - button mashing, crank turning, and lever pulling game
Lack of special attacks
Unremarkable playable characters and gameplay
Non-linear stage design gives game a choppy feel to it
Lack of interesting extras/unlockables",negative
1783,"I got one bundled with my system and one for $10, when I first got my Vita.  Now all they do is collect dust, since I popped for the 32 GB.

Data transfer is slow (slower than PSP memory stick duos and pretty much every memory device I've ever owned).

It is not quick or easy to manage the contents, back things up or restore them.  Even on the smallest of the cards.  Since you lose your home screen app configuration, every time to change cards, then it makes exchanging cards to play different games a nuisance.

There isn't a larger case to help keep the tiny from getting lost, hold other cards or even a thumb drive, to expedite data transfer (though I suspect this would require some kind of software and go against Sony's anti-piracy interests).

The only pro I give these things:  They're sturdier and harder to break than a micro SDHC card.

If you have lots of time to manage the content of your one card and only use it in conjunction with some cartridge games, then 4 GB are fine.  If you're a playstation plus subscriber, want 2 or more digital copies of games, other forms of media on your Vita, then you're going to want a bigger card.

I had managed to squeeze one cartidge save, two smaller digital vita games, a PS1 classic and 2 apps onto one 4 GB card.  There's quite a few games that would be all she wrote.

I prefer to spend more time gaming and less time managing memory and the larger card has the better $/GB cost, even if it is proprietary highway robbery.  I am entitled to think and share both before and after ownership, as a customer that they are not a good value, compared to other faster, cheaper, stable memory for other devices on the market.  Before, I gave it 3 stars for doing the bare minimum, but my neutrality on a meh product wasn't appreciated. Ok, I fess up - I don't like these.  The 4 GB least of all.  If you like whoever you got the vita for and want them to get the most out of it, then suck it up and get them the 32 GB and be done with it.

It discourages people from supporting Vita.  It discourages owners from buying more Vita games.  This in turn means fewer sales and fewer games for Vita owners.  I am a quality, over quantity person and I know quality costs more money, but it is a catch 22.  The fewer Vita owners and fewer of games bought by those owners, the fewer developers will invest in big quality Vita exclusives (which I want).  I'm also far more inclined to just use the 16 & 32 GB memory I already own to play on PSP and watch video on my phone at the current price points.  This is why price is not irrelevant like the minority of consumers for who belittle others for commenting on price, in addition to other failings in their reviews.  I realize the other side of that is this proprietary format is pro publisher, not just pro Sony.  So publishers, this stupid card thing is about piracy, so I'm given the publishers the evil eye for not putting forth more games for Vita.  I paid up for the overpriced cards. Where's my games at?",negative
1784,"Lets be honest here, I have been playing fighting games since Street Fighter was released in the arcades, and I am talking about the first one in the mid 1980s. Then of course the titanic Street Fighter 2 came out and changed the face of fighting games forever in around 1991. Well anyways it introduced a system of special moves that required fancy joystick movements and a series of button presses to pull off. The fighting genre was nothing but punches and kicks until SF2 came out. Well after the success of SF2 CAPCOM made Darkstalkers (Vampire Savior in Japan), which fused those special moves with over the top monsters from hollywood films like the wolfman, mummy, etc. with that special CAPCOM styling. It is an awesome series and in some ways I like it much better than SF2. But herein lies the problem with the PSP treatment, as much as I try to love this game for the rare gem it is, I can't. The control system was not tweeked enough back at CAPCOM to make it function properly with the PSP digital pad (directional pad), and thus we are left with essentially a button mashing mess. I am sure some will be unable to see past this flaw but when you are talking abut taking out the very foundation of a game series, in this case special moves, then you are left with a shell of what could have been the best 2D fighter ever released on a handheld system. It pains me to say that but it is true and I think if your honest with yourself you will appreciate that I hate it that this game didn't turn out well because of something so fundamental. CAPCOM please be wary next time!",positive
1785,"Graphics are OK and all PSP games are short so I'm not sure why so many here complain about that. With this game when an enemy comes into view and you begin to exchange fire the game actually freezes up and three seconds later when it begins to move again you're like, ""Oh I guess I killed the guy?"". This happens all the time. Very annoying and not something I've seen in any other game I've ever palyed (SOCOM / KILLZONE / SYPHON FILTER).

1786,"I give the graphics a good grade. The story an F. This game needed more dialog. I did like how it was a lot like soulblazer or actraiser, building the city. the music gets repetitive. I don't really understand why this game got good reviews. Its mediocre at best....",positive
1787,"Alone in the Dark follows Edward, an amnesiac followed possessed by a demonic entity that is ordered to follow the ""Path of Light"" in order to stop the demon from consuming New York City. Sounds pretty decent, doesn't it?

AitD struggles pretty much from the getgo with painful controls, a camera system that is great for filming movies, but deplorable for trying to play a game, and an inventory system that, while inventive and original, tries so hard that it forgets what it was trying to do in the first place. Control of the character is difficult enough without straying into combat, which is forced on you repeatedly. And while you're strong enough to ignore bone deep wounds and cuts and bruises, you can't swing a flaming club around faster than a 4 year old trying to bat in the majors.

The inventory controls suffer greatly as well, as its easy to pull stuff out and put it back, but it doesn't pause the game to stop the monsters from chewing half your face off. Also, there's no ""holster"" button, a standard staple from FPS time immemorial. So you can end up shooting half a clip while struggling to find the control to pull out your molotov to fight the monster that currently killing you.

Its a sad letdown to something that's otherwise rather decent. The storyline starts off well and progress at a decent pace. The graphics are good even by today's standards, and the voice actors actually know what they're doing, which seems to be a rarity in today's dubbing.",negative
1788,"The idea is good.  For those who like racing games, or even those who want to try them, this is a good one if you can get it cheap 5-10 dollars.  Those who play a lot of racing games might like this for a change of ""pace"", as there are none of the courses that are in so many racing games. The idea of racing across the US seems like a cool concept, and graphics wise it is fun to play for a little while.  The main problem that I find is the controls and the AI.  Because the cars don't seem/ feel like they're going fast there is a tendency to try to drive full bore, but the cars are so hard to control (the proverbial garbage truck on ice- the most extreme out of about ten- twenty racing games I've played) that the oversteer causes so many crashes and the ensuing clip scene.  Once you learn to slow it down it's a little easier to control but then it becomes apparent there is no real ""racing"" to it.  Example is you need to pass ten cars in a set area; all your doing is pacing out the passing so that the AI doesn't rubberband back so that you typically pass the last car close to the finish to complete that stage.  Since you're not so much trying to control throttle as maintain a even pace, then it's just a matter of weaving back and forth against all the obstacles, but since the control is so loose half the time it's just sheer luck you don't crash or even if you do your car resets and your back to maintaining the throttle and weaving back and forth like you've just finished a twelve pack of O'douls.  So again, if you can get it cheap, take a chance for a change of pace, just don't expect to actually be racing so much as weaving through scenery.",neutral

However... multiplayer in this game is a hot mess. They took every negative aspect of the past few CoD games and amplified them. The maps are such a clusterfk, potentially the worst I've seen in an FPS... there's nowhere to snipe, nowhere to hide, there's not even really any firefights, duels or anything like that, you're just running around in a circle trying to sneak up on someone before they turn around.

Not only that... it doesn't appear to show most of your stats (or any), I've also had multiple bugs where I'm stuck at a board and can't move/select anything, I'm also constantly being disconnected from lobbies for no reason. I don't have this issue with other games.

1791,"There is no manual Save function. It is a milestone system so you have to get to point x to trigger a save. I usually avoid those types of games because I hate the resulting situation where you keep having to replay 5 minutes of game (die, reload, respawn, redo) to get to the 30 seconds that keeps killing you. And this game has a lot of that.

It isn't anywhere near as smooth as other stealth games I've played, like Splinter Cell (all of them) or Thief (the best stealth games ever).

The rules for concealment were iffy but it was possible to hide and the soldiers would wander off eventually. The bad thing is that the soldiers all had pretty amazing eyesight so replying particular areas umpteen times to figure out the blind spots was kind of a drag.

The download went smooth and install went smooth.

A possible caveat: I put my computer together myself and it was rock steady right up until I moved from Win7 32 bit to Win7 64 bit and installed more RAM. Without getting into that issue, but I had to preface the following - I couldn't play much of the game. It kept crashing. Annoying as heck. However, I can't tell if that is a problem with the game or with my computer so I am giving the game the benefit of the doubt.

1795,"Gothic 1 and 2 -- for those who has the skill and patient to finish the games -- totally redefined the RPG experience, and are simply awsome beyond word.

Gothic 3 shares some of the earlier elements of its predecessors, most notable is a mysterious and nameless quality of immersion factor that keep you hooked despite the horrendous bugs. However, the Gothic 3's bugs are unforgivable (and apparently unfixable - unless someone rewrites the entire programming codes!)

If you read the other reviews -- and please do -- you already have a good ideas of what's wrong with this game, so I'll just elaborate on a few major negative points, that is, no matter what you do -- patches, .ini fix ... whatever -- you'll still have these problems to some degree:

1) Stun-lock: Some animal will strike you so fast that you cannot do anything, including running away. The patches tried like hell to fix this problem, but simply fail. The weird thing is that this problem look like it's sytem specific. eg. I have problem with wolves and jackals, while my friend - and most other people - have problems with the boars.

2) Uneven enemies levels: Animal are too hard to kill, while humanoid (anything walking on two legs except for trolls) are too easy. Humanoid enemies can easily be stunlocked by you. That is, button mashing will kill virtually anybody, bosses included. I wiped out an entire town on level 3 (very hard but certainly do-able). You got to try it to believe it. On the same token, it's both hilarious and depressing (because you just know the game you tried hard to love is broken beyond repair) to see a squad of elite orc warriors getting trashed by a single boar.

3) False innovation: Unlike what the game claims, and some people would like to believe, you cannot do whatever you want in Gothic 3. Yes, there are great freedom, but there are unintended consequences. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)For example, if you decided to be a hard core rebel bending on eliminating the orc from the beginning of the game, and destroy more than 3 orc towns, one of the main quest-related characters will just attack you and fight to the death. Thus rendering the main quest broken. The developer have admitted to this screw-up, but there is no fix for it.  (END SPOILER).

4) Unrealistic game world: Granted, most of the environment are detailed and beautiful, but a few things are horrible (these may be pet peeves - but please hear me out). First, most NPC's don't really talk to you; you hear a respond and sometimes a hand gesture, but there is no dialog box, and neither are the NPC's lips are moving, nor is he/she looking at you.
Secondly, talking about ""she,"" there are not enough women in the game world to make me believe that this world is real and alive. This is suppose to be a continent, not a military base camp or a prison colony. There a more women on the island of Khorinis (Gothic 2), and probably in the original prison colony (Gothic 1), than the entire continent of Gothic 3.

In conclusion, Gothic 3 is not a bad game, but it is far from being a good one. As a result, Pyranha Bytes, the game developer, is history. What that means is that -- most likely -- there will be no more official patch for this game (ver 1.12 is the last official patch) beside home made ones from the ever faithful Gothic community (I am in it).

In the inevitable comparison to Oblivion (I played both), Gothic 3 seems to be more fun in most aspects. On the other hand, Oblivion is so far ahead in being a polished, sophisticated, and well thought-out game that it makes Gothic 3 looks shameful. If you must know, Gothic 2 is still the king of the hill of RPG in my book.

In spite of my bashing, I thoroughly enjoyed Gothic 3 as a great free roaming adventure game with some RPG elements thrown in for good measure. At the current price of $17.99 (as of 9/7/07), Gothic 3 is a great deal.

Edit: (1/17/09) I just started playing Gothic 3 again with the Community Patch 1.6 installed. It is now a much improved game.  Granted, the major problems that I listed still persist - bit it has diminished quite noticeably.  Thanks to the Gothic community -You guys ROCK.",negative
1796,"In short, because there is not that much in this game to review, it is short.

The campaign is just not much more than a few hours, eight at most. The replay value is non existent,  so the only praise I would give the game is that they did in fact create a nice update for the Halo brand, but really, this could have been sold as DL content for $20.

This game is not worth the $60 dollars, and this is the last time I ever get a Halo spin off game without seriously reconsidering the value for the price.

1797,"This is a completely unremarkable first-person shooter.  Evidently some alien robots are plotting something dastardly in the jungles of Central America, and it's your job to make your way through their base of operations, shooting them as they obligingly pop out from behind obstacles in native villages (whose city planners for some reason seem to have designed their living quarters to resemble paintball arenas).

One thing that makes this one different is that, from time to time, you get to use a jet pack, and that offers moments of good clean fun floating about.

But there are problems.

The first is that you don't get to simply float about with this jetpack exploring the world:  this is not one of those games that encourages you to explore the world.  Every time you get to use the jet pack, there are aerial enemies that must be defeated.

Sadly, it's this very combat that dampens the fun of this game.  While exploring with the jetpack is fun in theory, fighting with it in the air is typically not, on account of your usually not knowing where enemies are, the way you certainly would if you really were flying through the air with a jetpack.  Instead, getting your guy to face the enemy can be tiresome and annoying.  Usually, if there's an enemy in front of you to be shot, it's just a conincidence:  it's not like you were able to hunt him down or guess his next move.  Most of the time you're flying in the wrong direction.

Another problem is that this is another one of those cookie-cutter adventures.  We present these problems for you, and there is only one way to solve them.  No other ways will be accepted.  You're going to follow the path this way, in this order, and accomplish the goal in this way, regardless of what your other ideas might be.  For example, you're only allowed to use your jetpack to jet to pre-approved places that the programmers provided the coding for.  The world you're in may appear open and inviting, but in reality you're forced to walk a narrow but invisible gangplank to get from here to there.  There are many cases when you can think of ways of flanking your enemy, but no such luck:  invisible walls prevent you from going any further in that direction, or landing on this or that ledge.  Why?  Do I have an effin' jetpack or not?  Then why can't I use it?

Most troublingly, though, the game falters storywise.  The whole premise of aliens setting up shop deep in the jungles of Central America during WWII was certainly a worthy one, but only if you allow yourself to be restricted by it.  The gamemakers certainly did not.  Suddenly they all speak English?  And your native guide suddenly starts talking like he's from Southern California?  And they go nowhere with the story:  I was taken by surprise when the credits rolled.  That's the end?!  I felt the story had gone nowhere.",negative

1812,"EDIT: After several months of owning this mouse, I feel like I need to make an adjustment to this review, as well as lower the stars from 4 to 2. I cannot recommend this mouse to serious CS:GO players.

I didn't have any hardware failure or problems, but I've realized that for the first time ever, my palms and fingers are actually sweating during gameplay. At first, I just assumed it was an external factor, but after some research I've found that this is a common complaint. The problem lies with the thin plastic that the mouse is made of, and the rgb lights underneath. The combination of the mouse internals and lights start to get warm during use and causes this your fingers sweat a little. A thicker plastic would help insulate this better. When you start to sweat, the rubber grips on the side become slippery and useless. The only way I could combat this was to wash my hands with dish soap to rid them of oil, so my fingers could grip better. But about an hour later, my fingers would start to slip again. I then replaced the grips with a rubber that is normally used on handgun grips, which improved my hold on the mouse. But after about an hour, my hands would begin to sweat and my fingers and palm were warm. Note that my hands never sweat when using a mouse. Turning the RGB lights completely off helped a little, but I feel like that kind of defeats the purpose of buying the Chroma to begin with.

I just cannot recommend this mouse to anybody at this price point. I'm disappointed by the quality when I compare it to other similar gaming mice. Sure, its comfortable. But not worth the money at all.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I'm pretty picky about mice, because I play CSGO with a pretty agressive claw grip, and it's tough to find mice that are actually comfortable. I've been using a Logitech G9x for the past couple of years and I've loved it's small size in my hand. But for years, I've always wondered what a Deathadder felt like. So I picked up a Deathadder Chroma and a big XL Corsair gaming mousepad, and decided to give it a couple hours of testing. Here are some of my thoughts.

Pros:

- This is one of the most comfortable mice that I've used. The shape makes you assume it's more of a palm grip mouse, which is what kept me away from trying it for so long. But I was pleasantly surprised when I realized it has a much higher arch than normal mice, which makes a claw grip very comfortable.

- Chroma lights are actually cool and not gimmicky feeling like on the regular Deathadder. I can turn them off or set them to a neutral white or yellow and it looks fantastic and less ""gamer"". The colors are very nice and much better than the LEDs in my Logitech.

- Buttons are very clicky and satisfying sounding.

- Aesthetically, this mouse is a piece of art. The subtle flaring on the mouse buttons and the matte finish are awesome.

Cons:

- For the price, I feel like they should have used a heavier duty plastic, with a heavier grain finish. The mouse looks really good but if you tap the top with your fingernail, it sounds hollow and the plastic feels cheap. I felt like I could kill a man with my G9x, where the deathadder feels much more delicate. This is my biggest complaint with the Deathadder, but it's not too bad. I feel like Razer should make a premium wired version of this mouse and use heavier materials, and use different switches under the mouse buttons for a more tactile feel.

- Rubber sides could have more grip, like the SteelSeries mice. It's not bad rubber, it just has a softer feel instead of a gripping one. I see it wearing away quickly. Also the side buttons lack any kind of bump or grip on them, and I wish they had some rubber on them.

- No DPI switch. A mouse at this price point should have one, even if it's underneath. I play with really low DPI on CSGO and it's a pain to have to manually switch profiles in Windows back and forth.

Overall, I really like this mouse. I didn't think I would ever really like a Razer product, but this is a solid mouse choice for pretty much anybody. My biggest gripe is the fact that the build quality and materials aren't up to par with Corsair and Logitech (mouse is plasticky and cheap feeling). I see this mouse wearing out quickly, unfortunately. Hopefully Razer will release a better quality version by the time that happens.",neutral

1814,"I was a little miffed I even needed to get this because I already had a universal remote (Harmony).

This remote works as advertised but the layout is less than stellar and they tried to map every single PS3 control button to the remote, so it's laden with buttons.

Also, you have to treat the remote just like one of the controllers and use the PS button to turn it on/off. Honestly, I think this is just an elongated PS3 controller.

The other issue is that when you  haven't used the remote for a bit and it goes to sleep, and then you issue a button press like Pause or Stop, you have to do it twice, because the first time the button press won't do anything except wake the remote up, then the second button press will actually work.

The obnoxious part about the remote is that it has *no* indicators of any kind on it. So you can't tell if it's on, off, asleep, synced or out of batteries. You just use it and if you push a button 3 or more times and it doesn't do anything, it's safe to assume it's dead.

A simple LED on the top would have done the trick, but then they wouldn't be able to keep the $29 margin of profit they make on this piece of hardware.

Overall it's a poor remote, some ""throw in"" you would expect with a normal TV and overly unacceptable as a remote for a nice TV (not even backlit).

But it's the only way to control movies on the PS3 without using the controller, so if you need it, I guess you are going to buy it.",negative
1815,"Got this game as a gift from my wishlist and it  had the potential to be pretty good, but their experimentation to create something different ruined it.  The battle system is different and awkward to a fault.  The graphics are good but there is no camera control walking aroind the world.  The views are too linear and at times it is unsure where you can go or where you should go.  There could be a door behind you but you can't see it because you can't turn the camera.  Some doors you can go in don't even look like doors so its easy to miss something.  There is no item screen so you have to preset your items for battle continuously as they run out.  This is stupid.  Cut scenes are too long and way cheesy for my tastes.  The so called ""turn based strategy"" isn't all that ""turn based"".  There is a timer that counts down at your first step and it you don't make your move before the timer is up, you lose your turn.  The guard command has to be initiated at the exact precise moment you are about to get hit, making this more of an action adventure than a rpg.

Basically,  the game sucks if you are used to your standard turn based rpgs.  The designers wanted to make something different and they did so extremely to a point where it makes the game frustrating and dumb.  So far, on day 2 of playing, I'm not impressed.

I'd also like to see some real weapons.  Fighting with umbrellas and canes?  Not very fun.",positive
1816,"I've had this controller for a while.  I don't like it and here's why:

3)  Sometimes during play the controller acts up putting you out of control of the game you're in.  This is remedied temporarily of course by turning the power button of the controller on and off, but you should never have this problem with a controller.

1817,"I am no means a Madden player, but I thought what the heck I will check this out.  I was very pleased with the graphics and how the game looks in 3D.  The reason I gave this such a low rating was the rosters.  The team I used still had players on the team that haven't been on the team for a couple of years, not to mention the team still had the old uniforms.  If you are going to market a game for 2012 you should have up to date rosters and the new uniforms.",positive
1818,"Let me start the review by saying that I'm not a COD hater at all. I purchased and played all titles since the 1st one on PC all the way to this one on PS4. I personally don't hate verticality and new movement system, but this game doesn't feel right.

IW Single player: It is pretty interesting and has the best graphics in the series. It worth a play through. Although, I didn't finish it.

IW Zombies: Pretty much like AW and BO3 zombies with 80's twist. I liked it ! pretty interesting and fun to play.

IW Multiplayer: I don't know where to start ! I played the Beta for almost 5-6 hours + 7-8 hours when the full game came out. If I want to simplify it, I say everything is wrong in this multiplayer.
I still love and play BO3 since I think they did a great job at making the game; however, IW is a different story:
Negatives:
-Lag/hit detection/lag compensation/ I may be bad at this game! Honestly, I have hard time figuring out what I'm doing wrong in this game. Why getting a kill feels so random??! I have an average of 3.22 K/D in BO3 TDM, but here I constantly die ! I shoot first, die first. I see players lagging around. I go against players from outside of U.S. I don't know what is going on. I'm not a bad player; in fact I call myself a tryhard, but I can't put my finger on it. There is something wrong in the net-coding/ hit detection that just doesn't seem right. Before you say "" oh, it's your connection"" no my friend, I have port forwarded my Ps4 and wired connection ( 200 Download/ 25 Upload, Dallas, Texas). Overall, gun fights seem random and doesn't feel like it involves any skill. In one of my game sessions ( I was playing for 1 and half hours ) I had 4 connection issues. 2 of them happened in the middle of a game and 2 of them totally disconnected me from the game ( it is day 3 after release ). So, 4 disconnections in 1.5 hour on day 3.

-Pay to win: Back in BO3 we only had 2 guns that were considered pay to win : Marshal 16 and maybe shadowclaw. Here they literally included gun variant that are clearly superior to base guns and the only way to get them is to spend some $.

-Maps: Ye ye I know, they designed the maps in a way to encourage the wall running. However, for some reason players have a bad habit of head glitching and camping around corners even on day ONE.You can literally get killed from any angle, and with this time to kill, some players don't bother with movement and they camp the whole game out.

MWR single player: As expected, they remastered the whole thing and it looks pretty good.

MWR Multiplayer: I might be 1 in a million player  who doesn't care about remasters/backward compatibility. I was NOT excited for MWR at all. Since I played the game on PC and PS3 just enough ( I still have it on my PC ) However, I should say, it feels good to go back to the old CODs. BUT this is a double edge knife. When you downgrade from all this jumping and sliding to a simple game like MW, players tend to get lazy and simply camp. I know, I mentioned this in IW part too, but it is all due to how community changed over the past few years. Again, the MWR is good and fun, but I don't think it'll last long. Everything in this game is the way it was 6 years ago. They didn't nerf/buff anything. So, expect a lot of corner campers with 2X Claymore and Martyrdom.

Over all, this bundle has the both sides covered. If you are a boots on the ground fan; you got it. If you are a chaotic/wall running/verticality fan; it got that one too. Neither of them are my cup of tea. MWR is outdated and boring/slow at this point; IW is very chaotic and full of non-sense. It maybe due to the fact that I loved BO3 so much that I can't play any other COD.

Marketing Technic: I work at Gamestop and we had more Legendary bundle sold than the regular version ( 16 IW pre-orders, 84 legendary preorders  on PS4 ). At the time that I'm writing this review, we had 3 copies traded in and the whole district has pre-owned copies in their store as well. Therefore, if you are buying this game just for MWR, Activation's marketing Technic totally worked and you have to pay $80 for a REMASTER ( REALLY ??) The MWR will be available around March as a stand alone DLC, your welcome ;-)",positive

1820,"This game could have been good if they had taken more care with it and spent a few more months in development. It has almost no depth as there are no items to buy, and exp is used soley to buy small move improvements. The voice acting is awful and ruins any sense of atmosphere.

1821,"Although it has a few promising traits, this was a very bad first attempt for a next-gen Yu-Gi-Oh! game, the gameplay is repetitive and tediously slow. Your stuck with three minor monsters for a long time, and there are no cut-scenes to speak of. Over all, this makes the sims look like an action game. My advice?

1823,"This extension cable (or, at least the one I received) does not allow the pressing of any of the triggers and the front facing buttons/joysticks at the same time.

This of course could be just a problem with my cable that I was shipped, but I do not plan on purchasing another.",negative
1824,I looked everywhere for this game and no one had it. Now I know why. Gamestop probably took all the copies out back and burned them. This game only sold because of the metroid name attached to it. Don't waste your time.  play the gameboy games instead,positive

His character isn't as graphic as the rest of cast.  The game its is a little hard to play because commands that pop up are too quick and small to read, much less be quick enough to press the proper button in the appropriate time frame.  Overall an average game that will be forgotten quickly not played for years like other games I have purchased.",negative
1827,"I want to make it clear this is a review of the Demo only.

I'm a long time role playing games fan and player. I was excited about Risen because the same group made Gothic 1 and 2 which were great games. But I was very disappointed after playing the demo. Many problems with the game. First, combat is boring and clunky. This is one of the most important areas in a rpg to get right since you will be doing combat for a vast amount of time in the game, in Risen the combat feels really clunky and hard to control and is boring on top of it. I can't imagine playing through the whole game with this kind of combat engine and mechanics.

Second, the world feels compact and small. You barely move over a hill or some ground and you are already in the next important area of the game. For some reason they put everything close together on the island. Third, the world has blurry graphics and terrible lighting. All the textures are hard to make out and they have some kind of blurriness to them, the lighting is very dark and should have been much brighter. Everything looks washed out, murky and blurry. It's not an attractive world to walk around in or explore to say the least.

Lastly, this game is basically an inferior remake of the Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 games. Most everything is recycled from those games, including the sound effects and monsters. Except the voice acting is bad and uninspired, where in the previous Gothics they had good voice work that was memorable. Also the combat in those Gothics was way better and more exciting. Even the graphics were better in that they were more pleasing to look at and create a superior atmosphere, even though they are outdated by several years, than in this game which had a poor artistic vision.

My advice is to try the demo before you buy the game. And then go ahead and buy Gothic 1 or Gothic 2 instead and play that if you haven't already, they are much better games than this inferior remake.",positive
1828,"Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z may in fact be the worst DBZ game on the PS3/X360. To begin with, the most obvious thing wrong with the game is the simple fact that there is NO OFFLINE VS MODE! I kid you not. What's one of the most important things about a fighting game? Being able to play in VS mode! The only way to fight someone (other than in the bland, scripted story mode where you can't control who you fight) is to play online. How could they mess this up this bad? What's so wrong with having an offline VS mode against the computer? Nothing, that's what. And that's just the beginning of a long list of things wrong with this game. The next big issue is the limited character roster and not being able to transform (go super saiyan) during battle. Mix that with extremely stale flying and fighting controls, and you have one huge let down. I mean, all the melee moves are controlled entirely by one button (that's what you want in a fighting game, right?). And only 8 characters have ultimate moves to top it off. All in all, this game is a let down by all means of the words. DO. NOT. BUY. IT.",negative

1832,"Back in the day, you could go to a drive in and watch really bad action movies like Bare Knuckles or Murder High.  Although the movies lacked production values, morals, and common sense, they were entertaining and fun.  WET captures that experience quite nicely.

Concept: 10/10
A beautiful girl in leather pants guns down 100 henchmen with a gatling gun while 50's Rock n' Roll plays in the background... suddenly the ""film"" breaks and you get a laughably bad and somewhat dirty commercial for hot dogs... when the 'movie' resumes, she's hacking up guys with a sword.  Action Packed + Sexy + Funny = Great Concept!

Story:  8/10
Rubi Malone has been betrayed by a crime syndicate full of degenerates and she wants her revenge.  Rubi is a loner and a hired gun who will do any dangerous job for the right price.  Scumbags die, limbs fall, heads roll, and cars explode.  Parts of this game will make you cringe, cheer, or laugh out loud.  Rubi Malone is voiced by Eliza Dushku, best known as Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Echo from Dollhouse.  She does a decent job, but the story would have been more entertaining if she acted a bit better or a bit worse (on purpose) and the script was more over-the-top.

Gameplay:  7/10
When the game first begins, only a few of Rubi's moves are available, so the game feels really clunky as some of the animation transitions are very rough.  The game sacrifices fluidity for speed, and for a ""Grindhouse"" style game, it's ok.  Rubi is armed with twin pistols and sword.  She faces mobs of henchmen and kills them by the dozens while using acrobatic props.  Whenever Rubi performs an acrobatic move (wall run, jump, pole swing, zip line, slide, dive...) the game slows down allowing the player to aim and become more effective at killing bad guys.  When Rubi is in this mode, she is much harder to hit.  With each bad guy she kills, a score multiplier increases, giving her more points per kill and boosts a healing factor.  The acrobatic, gun, sword, scoring system, and health regeneration features all combine to reward the player for aggression.  This isn't one of those duck behind a wall games... this is a kill the bad guys as fast and as cool as possible games.  As you get better at the combat and you unlock more moves, the game becomes really fun.  There is some depth here that you wouldn't expect.  At the end of each level, you get a score and you use those points to unlock new moves or improve Rubi's weapons.

Levels:  6/10
There are five different types of levels in the game.  They range from Great to Poor.

Arena levels are large areas loaded with gymnastic type ramps, walls, poles, etc... and they are laid out like Tony Hawk Style Tricklines.  As you play, you try to maximize the acrobatic moves as you kill the bad guys.  The level ends when you destroy a set number of enemy spawning points with your sword.  These are the best parts of the game!

Quicktime Sequences are also in this game.  Press the right button at the right time to watch Rubi do amazing stunts.  The timing is generous, but if you press the wrong button, you die.

Rubi Vision levels occur at set times and begin when Rubi shoots a guy and gets blood in her face.  These levels are cell shaded in red.  Rubi gets a decent healing factor and is rewarded for Chain Kills.  Basically, killing guys within 5 seconds of each other increases the counter.  If the timer runs out, the counter resets to zero.  The enemies have low HP, so these levels are a fun change of pace and reward aggression.

At certain points in the game, Rubi flashes back to her home base... a junkyard... where she runs through timed obstacle courses and shoots targets.  Every target shot takes 2 seconds off of her time.  If she completes the course fast enough, you earn a gold, silver, or bronze medal.  Because you don't have to do these over and over, they are kind of fun.

The worst levels in the game are platforming levels.  They are loaded with insta-deaths and you must restart them from not-so-generous checkpoints.  These go against the strengths of the game, which is the fast paced combat.

You cannot replay levels over again in the Story Mode, but there is a ""Points Mode"" where you can replay levels with maxed out abilities and weapons to try and achieve a high score.  If you perform badly in a level while you are in Story Mode and you don't earn enough points to upgrade Rubi, the remainder of the game will become much more difficult.

Graphics:  5/10
The environments are passable, but the character art looks dated.  The game gets away with this because it is a game based on low-budget movies.  There is also a ""scratchy film"" filter running over the art as you play, so the game does feel like you are watching an old bad movie.

Sound:  10/10
The explosions, gunfire, and screams of the dying punctuate the battles and the Tarantino-esque Soundtrack is perfect.  There's old school rock, surf guitar, and garage band music.  All of it delivers a perfect grindhouse atmosphere.

Humor:  8/10
This game will make you laugh out loud and shock you at its audacity.

Replay Value:  5/10
There are four difficulty levels and a special 1 bullet - 1 kill mode for the hardcore fans.  Aside from these and the ""challenge mode"" there really isn't any reason to replay the game and for most people, one time through will be enough.

Maturity:  M
The swearing in this game surpasses a biker bar on alimony night and there's enough killing in this game to fill a battlefield after a small scale war.  There is no sex or nudity, which was kind of surprising.  It's M-Rated because of the violence, blood, and language.

Overall:  7/10
This ends up being a good game for the same reason that you like ""good"" bad movies.  They aren't complex, they aren't pretty, and you just sit back, laugh, and have a good time.  The game lacks features, it's rough around the edges, and there are a few bugs.  But in the end, it manages to be fun.

Buy it cheap if you love action games or bad action movies and you understand that this is a ""Budget"" title.
Rent it if you have 6-8 hours to blow through the story mode.
Avoid it if you need high production values like Call of Duty, Halo, or Assassin's Creed.

If you enjoyed this game at all, get Bayonetta.  Bayonetta is more fluid, has high production values, it's sexier and funnier.
Other great action games include Ninja Gaiden 2, Assassin's Creed 2, and if you have a Wii, No More Heroes!",neutral
1833,"I've played and won F-1 championship season 2006. This game is not as good. They changed car physics so they handle differently than the old game. Harder to handle.

I played through it thinking the game would redeem itself but really it trudges along taking it self too serious and not having fun like the rest of the GTA family.  Worth playing through the story I guess, but I found myself thinking haven't I done this before in a more fun way in SA... or even Vice City.  I barely made it through the first playthrough and I'm headed back to San Andreas.",positive
1835,"This game is sub par for Blizzard.  Not fun, no customization and offers nothing new.  Just play Diablo 2 and save your money.",negative
1836,"The game is rather fun, but I have to warn you. There are parts that'll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration. That is all that you have to know about this game, is that it'll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration. If you want your sanity kept in check avoid this game at all costs.

The developers of this game show very well that they don't realize what actually counts in making a game fun, and that part is the fact that it has to be fun. Frustration only sits there to impede on this. There are numerous issues for this game and I'll explain the biggest ones below.

First and foremost, some of the 'checkpoints' wherein if you die you get ressurected to, at the end of the game are nigh and far between on the ""tanker"" level the second time you go in. You'll have a part wherein it's literally one minute time your movement perfectly or restart, then you have to jump perfectly or you'll fail and have to do that along with the one minute perfect moves again. Why they didn't make it so that you could go back to the jumping perfectly area again after you die is anyone's guess. I personally believe it's because they're idiots who don't know good QA.

The next biggest issue with thsi game is the minigames. They suck, plain and simple they suck. There is no ryhtm, there is rhyme there is no pattern. What they do is the equivalent of button mashing the controller at random intervals. This is how they do their ""minigames"". Some of them are optional, some are not. The ones that are not are the worst. The very end of the game you have one that is identical to one that you've already faced except it's a million times worse. It's pure button mashing with no pattern, at all, also no indication of progress. Also like the checkpoints in this game, minigames have none. And this is one of them, wherein if you mess up once, back to the beginning. You have to be able to handle the left/right hand of the screen top to bottom, along with being able to press all 8 of the face buttons at any given time without any messups!

Also driving any vehicle in this game is reminiscent of grand theft auto, except it's actually worse. And you have to repeatedly drive a vehicle to beat the game. So unless you like failing, time and time again, I'd avoid this game. If you are a glutten for punishment since the controls are horrible, then by all means enjoy this game.

This game has too many flaws to call it a good game. The issue here is how they designed it, and I cannot give it anything higher than 2 stars. If you take out the horrible minigames, and fix that there are badly placed checkpoints on one of the levels, and the horrible controls when piloting a vehicle then this is definately a 5 star game, the platforming is really fun, there is loads of humor and the levels are pretty well designed. But to summarize it again, avoid this game unless you're really into the jak and daxter series or are a glutten for punishemtn. I know that I'll never replay this game again, once I'm done thsi time it's going to sit on a shelf and colelct dust. The game's not worth replaying due to it's flaws which make the game feel like they had no QA.",positive

1838,"Right out of the box on release day, ridiculously huge update and can't play for 3 hours while it loads. Then, the loading menus take another 20 minutes, like I give a sh** about commentary updates. The menus are slow and jump around which is annoying, and then the gameplay starts. As with most Madden games, receivers can't catch the ball if there is a defender on the field ... no run/pass blocking ... and it doesn't matter if you are playing the browns, if you are up 45-0 in the 4th, they will come back and win and you can't stop them.

1839,"I bought this game as part of a set with Hidden Mysteries - Buckingham Palace. I enjoyed the historical information and game play in the Buckingham Palace game; but this Civil War counterpart was FAR LESS FUN and VERY DARK. It was difficult to view whole sections of the screen, because the coloring seemed overly dark.

My biggest frustration was the miniscule size of many of the objects. The game creator apparently found it too difficult to artistically conceal all of the various objects, so he/she resorted to making some of them so tiny that the gamer would need a magnifying glass to actually identify those objects. That shows a lack of talent as a game creator. The objects should be 'hidden' not just reduced to a size that makes them almost invisible. The talent lies in the imaginative way that the objects are blended into their environment.

I got tired of this game is a very short time. I will enjoy the Buckingham Palace instead.",neutral
1840,"When this game downloaded it put a lot of Microsoft stuff on my laptop, I had never seen one do that before. And later my computer went down so I don't know about that. The series has always been very informal and good on the time of WW2 and I love that. To  have it work on my system I needed a shadow pixer or something so I am just back to Panzer General 2, the morphed version and my 9 campaigns of about 50 scenarios each. But again I have enjoyed the Hearts of Iron series.",positive
1841,"Seems OK but there is a major glitch with the camera.  It keeps getting stuck in one angle making it impossible to run around.  Only solution so far is reload.  Can't see how they missed this one as it happens early on in the game.  No excuse as far as I am concerned.  Another example of port gone bad?  Port after the fact means minimal testing and very small budget for bug fixes I guess.  Unless there is a fix for it I would suggest your look elsewhere.

FYI this game is one of those action games that requires you to maneuver your character around by climbing walls and jumping ledges etc.  If you don't like this style of game, maybe skip it for that reason too.

Additionally so far the game is rather character dull.  Of course that may be unfair on my part.  I have not been able to get past the camera glitch to really spend quality time with Death.

I couldn't get into the game and especially couldn't get into the characters, I felt like I was.watching one of my kids shows it just felt very childish.

Once you add the missing components the PS3 is a much better deal, runs silently, and looks much nicer.

Now, THIS GAME ""inFAMOUS"" is really bad. I can not believe it has such ratings. You run around and mindlessly try to electrocute stuff. You should hear the voice overs, non intentional comedy.

1851,"This is no WiiSport.  Not by a long shot.  The darts game is annoying due to the limited range of motion used.  If you throw the dart too fast it flies off screen.  If you move your hand too far, the dart flies off screen.  What's the point of having a target if, when you throw something at the target, the game takes it off screen???  There are aiming issues when playing this game on a big-screen too.

The air hockey game is horizontal and not vertical.  Yes, they put the table on screen SIDEWAYS -- meaning instead of left/right motion used to defend the goal in most air hockey games, this one requires an up/down motion.  The left/right motion, in this game, is a forward/backward.  It's an utterly absurd design choice that ruins the game.

The rollerball game doesn't follow the usual control standards used in other games either.  To adjust angle of roll, instead of pressing A then left/right arrow, you have to press +/-.

The hoops game was mildly entertaining though again it suffers from a very limited range of movement.  The action movement could be more realistic too.  Any wrist movement during the shot sends the ball off too high or too low.

The trivia game was mildly entertaining -- though I somehow managed to spin the wheel seven different times and still managed to get the same category, Music.  Being asked a question about Brittney Spears ruined it.

The pong/cup/whatever toss game was hopeless.

1852,"Recommendation:
* If you want a first person shooter with slightly more story: this is your game.
* If you want an adventure game keep moving.

I played the first 5 chapters of this game -- and was bored to tears.  There were very few puzzles and the solutions didn't make ANY sense.  You get to solve such exciting puzzles as ""locked door"" and ""how to get over there"" over and OVER and OVER.  Apparently the only problem anyone ever has to face on an adventure is what sequence of stones to jump from (how to get over there), and how to open a door.  Frequently the solution to one of these problems will be to shoot and ignite a powder keg an enemy has left lying around for no good reason.  The resulting explosion will create a path, or blow open a door.

By the 3rd of 4th chapter the game abandons any storytelling and just drops you into firefight after firefight after boring firefight.  You will die a lot because you'll be low on ammo and the enemies just KEEP coming.

None of this is really fun.  It's as if they wanted to make an adventure game but found out game design is hard and just went with gun battles instead.

The game has a few technical issues as well.  The controls feel a bit clunky (but way better than say, little big planet -- so there's some credit).  The other thing that drove me nuts is whats called ""screen shear"".  This is when half of two different frames of animation appear on the screen at the same time.  It's kind of technical why this can happen -- but I've *NEVER* seen a ps2 or ps3 game that had shear artifacts before.  Some XBOX titles do have these and its one of the reasons I buy more PS3 games than 360 games!",positive
1853,"I am a fallout fanatic and played all the fallout games. Fallout 3 was great, but became very buggy (frequent crashes) when I started playing the extra expansions like mother ship zeta, anchorage, etc.
Fallout Las Vegas is buggy as hell and crashes a lot. I lowered all my settings and played in windowed mode. That has helped some, but the crashes are still there.

There are two major bugs to be very aware of:
If the game crashes during play do not be surprised if you lose your quick and auto save settings to a default save setting. As if you never played at all. So do a position save (you have a 1000 save spots to choose from).  Do not count on quick saves (via f5) or autosave (when you enter/exit an area, etc).

For some reason there are too  many npcs the game may slow down, there will be a  lot of stop and go action. Make sure you save often.

I updated all my drivers and I have a nvidia graphics card. May be the issue is with nvida dunno. Very frustrating.
Hope they fixed the damn bug!
As for the moral dilemma thing with karma, that area needs a lot of work! For example I am fighting against raiders/slavers called the power gangers at a correctional facility they have take over.  Yet, after defeating the scum... I realize I was getting karma hits for looting almost everything there. Wow I did not know looting from slavers, murderers, etc after they try to kill you is a crime. Where is the karmic law in that game? Seriously in such a world the only real law is the law of the gun; you know survival of the fittest. I can understand the difference of good and evil and I like being the good guy, but in a world such as this. Makes it impossible If I need a bottle of water to survive and it is the property of a murdering thief rapist.... Why do I get the karma hit? I am the one defending myself and dying of thirst. Let alone trying to survive in a nuclear holocaust. Ridiculous! What where the developers thinking?... Suddenly they are the moral/karma police? Very idiotic/ridiculous/you name it.",neutral

1855,"After going back and forth between deciding whether or not to purchase 2DS to play the new Pokemon game, I ended up deciding to purchase one through Nintendo's refurbish program. I'm not a kid and I purchased the unit for myself, so my perspective may be different from the younger crowd.

I would recommend purchasing a refurbished unit through Nintendo if you aren't going to buy a new unit. They have a very strong refurb program and the device I received seemed to have a completely new exterior. Given that the majority of the people who own these handheld systems are very young, you don't want to end up purchasing a grimey device or ones with buttons that aren't fully functional.

While your phone will likely have much better performance and a higher quality screen, it also costs $300-600. The 2DS isn't breaking any technological grounds in terms of its power. Its designed to be affordable, which is why I'm baffled by the price of the games for the system. One new game costs almost as much as the entire unit itself.

The build of the system is decent. It doesn't feel like its going to break if you carry it around in various bags. The 2DS isn't really a system that is going to fit into your pocket like a 3DS. The joystick is mostly usable, although I'm finding it can be a bit difficult to control as compared to a regular gamepad. The directional pad and the buttons are too small for my preference, but the unit would be too big if they increased the button size. I actually dislike the pen functionality and try to avoid using it as much as possible.

The shape of the unit isn't comfortable to hold for a long time. The edges of the unit do not have any curvature, so the edges end up getting pushed into the soft part of my palms. The L and R buttons aren't very accessible, and I'm happy that I have a game right now that doesn't use them, but I imagine it will get frustrating if I have to keep my index finger over them.

And finally, there are three front-facing lights on the unit that are far too bright and never turn off while the unit has power or is charging. One indicates wireless transmission (I think) another one indicates power and the last one indicates charging. If you are trying to use this system as something to do while you are sitting in bed trying to fall asleep, these lights will be aimed almost directly in your eyes, and there is nothing between the bright LED and you to diffuse or soften the light.

Basically, if there was any other way to play new DS games, I would choose that over the 2DS. I have seen the 3DS and I don't find it any more usable for the price increase.",positive

1859,"Nothing about these headphones was egregiously bad, but for $300 (as of this writing) they should be better than they are.

When I unboxed these cans, my first impression was that Creative spared no expense.  From the supple leather padding to the metal trim, this set *looks* high quality.  They fit extremely comfortably- even for a guy with a big noggin like me.  But once I turned them on, my pleasure went out the window.

Pairing with my iPhone and Mac went smoothly, and I was up and running within just minute or so.  But pairing to my PC well, it never happened.  First, nothing happened.  Then, the set was detected but requested drivers.  Trying to install the drivers sent me into an infinite loop of frustration.  After about an hour of messing with it I gave up.  Maybe that's more telling about the convenience of PC versus Mac, but that's a flame war for another time.  The bottom line is that I game on my PC, but can't use these gaming headphones on my PC.  My wife hates the expression ""epic fail"", but fails don't get much more epic than that.

Rather than relegate my swanky new headset to my basement drawer of useless gadgets, I decided to first give them a try as my main music headset.  Switching from a pair of Bose IE2 earbuds to the Creative EVO ZxR was like trading in the BMW for a Corolla, but swapping the price tags too.  The ZxR sound is muted, muddy, and way too heavy on the bass.  The Creative cans are the opposite of crisp.  I fiddled with the iPhone EQ app for about an hour before I came to the conclusion that I am just plain spoiled by my Bose buds.  Say what you want about Bose being ""overpriced"" in general, but the ~$100 Bose IE2 buds sang circles around the ~$300 Creative EVO ZxR cans.

""But the Creative set has noise cancelling,"" you say.  Hogwash.  Creative's idea of noise cancelling is more like adding white noise. With music playing I couldn't notice any appreciable difference in ambient noise whether the feature was on or off.  With the music switched off, activating the feature added an ever so quiet hiss- but still didn't seem to have much effect on background noise.  When you consider that the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 Noise Cancelling cans sell for the same price on Amazon, I can't fathom why anyone would opt for the Creative EVO ZxR set.

In summary, there's absolutely no reason to buy these mediocre headphones.  The comparable Bose QC 15 noise cancelling set is better quality for the same price, while the Bose IE2 earbuds are better quality (minus noise cancelling and wireless) at a third of the price.",positive
1860,"Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 is finally here, hitting every platform available as it seems, and while the end result turns out to be good on the XBox 360 and PS3, what we find here on the Wii is a disappointment to be sure.  The Wii version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 manages to provide good amounts of action and a large cast of Marvel heroes and villains to pick from and put to use, but the rest of the game is fairly messy.  Bland graphics and environments, terrible AI (especially that of your partners), a poor camera, and no use of alternate controlers meaning you're stuck using the Wii-mote and nunchuk with some pointless and annoying motion controls, and this is what you get.  When the first Marvel Ultimate Alliance came out, it was a pure blast all across the board, and one of the best games to get for the Wii at the time.  Even on the Wii, the fusion attacks still look good and perform well, and the four player local co-op mode can be fun, but other than that, there really isn't a whole lot here to look forward to.  All in all, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 on the Wii is worth a look for Marvel loving Wii owners, but in the end, the Wii version is a disappointment.",positive
1861,"I'm not exactly what to think about this game, it was sorta fun at times, and being a die-hard Crash fan who even appreciated Twinsanity, of course I was gonna get it, but this was somewhat of a letdown. For one, the concept of the game is a complete ripoff of Mario Party, which is not a huge problem considering that this is a handheld game and they had limited options. The biggest thing that bothered me is that the mini-games were either extremely easy (I have NEVER lost the 3D maze game), WAY too hard (The ball rolling ones can be very agitating), or they made no sense because they poorly explained the directions (like the baseball one and blowing up the balloon). So I'm playing the game and this is frustrating me, and yet, I end up still beating the entire thing in less than two hours, meanwhile unlocking every secret that the game had to offer. So basically, the adventure mode takes no skill to win and barely occupies any time. I would only suggest doing the free play mode and it's only something that would be fun for a little while on short airplane flights or bus rides, for anything that needs to draw your attention for longer than a half hour, get something else.",neutral
1862,"It seems to me, with very rare exception, that for the last ten years, 80% of the Star Wars games that are released are all (basically) clones of the old 'Rebel Assault' PC title.  Dress them all up anyway you want, but when all's said and done, you're really playing the same game.
You will have several different vehicles to pilot as well as being on foot, but the whole game's plot is essentially the same: finish the level as fast as you can without getting killed ... that's it.  There's not a lot of strategy involved past that, that's about it.  Frustrating part is, they could have stuck to the mold and still added a little variety.  For example, how about letting us pilot one of those AT-ATs for a little while?
The one thing that I had hoped may be a saving grace would be the animated cut-scenes between levels, but even they were a little sub-par.  Aside from the animation being (at best) average, there were too few of them.  Even the ending animation scene was only about a minute or two!  I finished the game and that's all I'm rewarded with?
I'll also answer the question that I know at least a few of you have.  No ... this game will not lend any hints to what may be ahead in the new Episode III and does nothing to advance the plot of the prequel trilogy.  They may have been able to sell a few more titles if this game was a little more tied to the plot of the movies.  The recently released 'Enter the Matrix' game as a terrific example to what I'm talking about.  On a side note, it was nice though to see an old character from the comic books named Ulric Qel-Droma make an appearance.
So, as been stated before, if you liked Rebel Assault (I or II), Starfighter, Bounty Hunter, and Jedi Starfighter ... etc etc ... then this is probably going to be right up your alley.  One the other hand, if (like me) you're getting a little burned-out on this style of play, this isn't going to do ANYTHING for you.",positive
1863,"This GBA game is quite challenging, but that's not my problem with it.  The problem is the graphics is low-quality and the levels very repetitive.  There's very little to do other than shooting your way around, and all the soldier enemies look the same.  The tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot, so the challenge frequently turns into frustration.  All this is not helped by rather poor sound effects.

Anchor should be ashamed of themselves and Microsoft should be downright embarrassed.
It's things like this that validate all the Xbox bashing that's been going on. The charges of it being an eye candy machine and nothing more stand true on games like this.

Let me say here and now that Smackdown 3 still stands well unchallenged as the best wrestling game of the newer generation thus far. I think GC's Wrestlemania game has great potential.

This had outstanding potential and I was well pleased when this got delayed by four months. Why? Because I thought a lot of extra work was going into it. Now I shudder in fear to think of what this would have been like had it been released on its original December date.

The Pros: Gorgeous looking and sounding, like any Xbox game.
Cons: Gameplay mechanics are slow and cumbersome at times. Player model and movements are downright bewildering.
Near zero options and replay value. You can't even go for the tag titles! No story mode! No steel cage, no Royal Rumble...no nothing!
The roster is filled mostly with jokes. 35 wrestlers sounds impressive until you realize it's filled mostly with names like K-kwik and Haku!! There's no excuse for not having the updated, post-Invasion roster ready to go.
I am angry enough about this that I am starting to make plans to unload my Xbox. I have one game for it: Halo. I don't see anything coming anytime soon that looks promising. Everything else has been empty eye candy.
This is a crime and they should pull it off the shelves and issue an apology. They should also rework, top to bottom and in about six months give us the finished product.

1866,"Rated 2.5
(middle of the road)
 This game has many clever elements, like a game where a wave of zombies is entering this house, you are not allowed to leave it and must blast zombies as they enter the room from different doors. The effect is like being able to play around inside a Romero horror film, to a certain degree. Graphically, this is an arcade-looking game, but it's focus is more on its difficulty than story, character, graphics, guns, modes or anything else.
 I am disappointed in the music, the title screen techno is pretty nice, but mostly the music is either unimpressive, repetitive techno or something like Danny Elfman run through a computer. When you're shooting up zombies and aliens, subtlety is not needed. Ideally, the music should have gotten your blood pumping.
 What I really enjoyed was the level designs, some are far better/worse than others. You can go to Notre Dame and 1930's Chicago (a Perfect Dark reference?) right next to each other. However, I never knew *WHY* I was doing whatever I was doing, or why and how I'm able to move through time or change genders, as it was more left to the imagination, because there's no intro cinema scene. So obviously the characters and story meant nothing to me, I didn't have a reason to want to get further in the game beyond seeing new level graphics. The levels themselves are nice, but seem more like a wide hamster tunnel than detailed, realistic, full areas. There are plenty of areas that lead to nowhere and wasted space. There's just not enough to do in a level like the Dam to want to go back to play it again and again (like Goldeneye 007), moving through the endless repetitive layers of stairs simply on a higher difficulty level w/ more objectives doesn't thrill me.
I liked the more bizarre characters but most are military, old-fashioned or zombies - they're all in a tacky cartoon-ish style, baggy pants, gargantuan breasts, PVC suits and so on in lame PS2-quality models. If you like Aliens, Plasma weapons, black leather, guns that take up 25% of your screen, techno music, futurist settings and so on, this should be a hit. I alternated between accepting the game on it's goofy terms and wishing it were either more serious, goofy or just plain better executed. It's fun while it lasts, but the biggest kicks I got was from the absurdity, references to Perfect Dark/007 (when it's hardly anything like either of those games, you won't play it nearly as much - more like Quake), and graphics for levels. I do actually enjoy this somewhat, but if this is the Best FPS of *2002*, Vgame genres could use a cerebral revolutionary bath.",neutral

The storyline was taking shape well, and then i hit an unjumpable pit, literally. The programmers have already issued a notice about this, but that doesn't help when i have to restart the game from the beginning because i didn't create an extra manual save point before the midgard serpent chapter. At this point, if this bug is encountered, a ramp will not appear that is required to jump the pit. There is no way around this and the pain and frustration of finding an uncompleted puzzle has been realized. I so wished i could have finished this game, but my frustration of spending a few hours trying to solve this puzzle before researching it made me wish i had created that savepoint. I hate pulling down the rating of such a beautiful game, but that bug killed my enthusiasm.

1870,"The CM Storm Pulse-R stands out with the aluminum plates on the rear of the headset, built with a solid metal headset frame, and produces pleasing stereo sound.  Lows, bass, and other booming sounds/noises are apparent. Though I like the Pulse-R for it's comfort and appealing design, I feel the Pulse-R is lacking in some areas to give gamers a full, enjoyable experience.

FEATURES
- Aluminum plates. Wow, imposing and awesome. Never seen aluminum plates placed on the rears of speakers like this. It looks mean and rock solid. The plates are removable and customizable.
- Detachable microphone. I like that it's detachable, but not so much that you can't flip it up or retract it. You can, however, move the mic (body) like you can with a goose neck microphone.
- Auxiliary or USB powered. When plugged in with USB, the White LED lights up on the underneath the aluminum plates. Sweet. The headphone and microphone 3.5mm jacks and USB connection shares the same chord. Kinda wished there the chord came with velco to bound up the connection that isn't being used.
- Cushioned headband and earcups (faux leather). Very comfortable.

DESIGN
+ Metal frame. The headset has a metal frame, which bodes well for durability. At the top of the headband, There are cutouts to expose the metal frame, which is just a neat way to present the appealing design.
+ Volume control slider on the chord. Easy to reach and change on the fly during gaming sessions.
+ Thick earcup cushions. At about an inch thick, it's extremely comfortable and isolates (not noise cancel) outside noise surprisingly well.
+ Glossy finish on the rear speakers give it a nice, sleek finish.

PERFORMANCE
Gaming - Using the Pulse-R for gaming left me wanting more. Stereo headsets do not have the luxury of surround sound reproduction. In my opinion and experience, a stereo gaming headset MUST excel in powerful, booming bass, clear and distinguishable layers of sound. Bass and lows are apparent, but not clean.  The sound clarity is there, but lacks something - balance and richness.

Battlefield 4 - A lot of things are going here. There are several layers - your weapon sounds, immediate teammates, dialogue from characters in game, enemies from all sorts of distances (high ground, underground, far, close, left, right). A stereo headset won't tell you where sounds are coming from, but it will put the sounds either left or right. I found myself unsatisfied with the Pulse-R's inability to crisply deliver even the layer of weapon from dialogue from players. Muffled. Messy. Air-y. Lacks richness and clarity.

Microphone - Microphone does project the voice, but not with a warm, clean output. It feels muffled as if I was in a subway making a phone call. The microphone placement is also suspect. Why is is stationary? It's stuck in the parallel position as soon as you plug in the microphone. Most gaming headsets' microphones are flip up, retractable, or has a goose neck that is easily moved like mold. Not the Pulse-R's. It' stuck.

Sound is much clearer. Microphone on the Plantronics GameCom series has amazing clarity.

CM, back to the drawing board for the microphone, please. No one should have to remove the microphone just to get it out of the way. Microphone clarity and output can be A LOT better. See Plantronics, Logitech, and turtle beach for their microphones.

This is a luxurious price ($90 currently as I write this) for a STEREO gaming headset. I was disappointed. The Pulse-R does a few things right: excellent comfort, sleek & appealing design, and lightweight comfort for extended gaming sessions. But, it failed at providing a clear and clean microphone & sound that produced balance and enough clarity to benefit gamers (FPS in particular).

Sincerely,
A Disappointed FPS Gamer

If you haven't decided now, just reading the upcoming changes should give you a clue as to how fcked up this game IS and how extensively long most of these changes are going to require. Even the current producer is not shying away from saying this (the length of time to implement most of the changes properly).

Then if that doesn't persuade you to avoid this failure, take a good look at some of the changes they want to make. These, for the most part, are BASIC actions, tools or what have you. I'll list a few of the changes ""planned"",

1. Server load. Still the same as FFXI, actually it's worse as FFXI is much better now. Even with ragnarok and cat sith merged it's still quite alright.

2. Alot of battle related issues

  b. can't target more than 1 mob
  c. lag causing whatever you do tedious
  d. limited action bar, why?
  e. timing/motion of mob and player off >.>, come on.
  f. and so on and on...sigh
3. Still growing NMs, which is a good thing!
4. Healer class being wimpy >.>

I can understand someone having with the game but please don't fool others in thinking this game is anything close to what it should have been. Lessons that should have been learned from FFXI, WoW (server load for example), and other MMO's were shoved aside so the arrogant previous producer can have his own way and release his shtty version of the game, despite protests and testing in alpa/beta stages.

Don't support SE on this game, make them feel the pain. I don't know about anyone here but my disappointed with this game runs deep.

1876,"First off, there are a lot of issues with trying to get access to previously purchased DLC. The biggest selling point of the game was that it carried forward over 1,500 songs from the previous games. For this to not be working after being publicized so heavily makes the game look bad.

Next, some of the new features are just not good and actually ruin immersion. The new guitar solo mode, for example, replaces the masterful solos pulled off by incredible artists like Hendrix, Joe Perry, Eddie Van Halen, and Tom Morello and instead want you to make up your own solo on the fly. It takes you out of the song. And what's worse is that turning that feature off doesn't always seem to save in the settings, so you have to check each time you start to make sure it didn't re-enable itself.

Lastly, some returning features have been dumbed down. The character creation has a laughably small amount of options and scrolling through your song list is a joke now because you can no longer skip from letter to letter with the artists names like before.

I feel like the game would have been helped greatly if it spent a little longer in development being play tested by people who don't work for Harmonix (who this comment section shows are very biased and unethical) and the DLC should have been completely buttoned down before release.

By now, anyone who doesn't know at least the basic story of Lord of the Rings must be living in a cave. Hobbits. A Ring. A Quest to Take the Ring to Safety. Evil Riders. This game has them all.
The graphics are really pretty stunning. The little Hobbiton village, the forests, it all gives you a real sense that you're in Tolkein's world, interacting with the characters. Combat is simple turn-based stuff. You do a lot of message-delivering and mushroom-gathering.
Now, for the bad part. First, the game is very directional. You must get Item A from Spot 1 to Spot 2. Receive a coin. Take a message over to Person C. Get a cabbage. You gather a few coins by raiding your friends' homes and then steal their crops! Not very nice.
And when you've found these few items, you're stuck. There's no way to find more. If you want a third dagger for your party, sorry, the vendor only had 1. If you want to kill more Big Dogs to get your characters better at fighting, nope, you killed the only Dogs in Town. You roam the area looking for more things to do, but you are forced to trudge along to the next area.
Which leads to the REALLY bad part. Just about every single person I've talked to about this game has complained of severe crashing problems. The Mines of Moria are particularly notorious for crashing a lot, but crashes happen elsewhere as well. A crash can easily destroy hours of very tedious back-and-forth plodding.

First of all I would like to know why the hell your not Gabe Logan in this game!?!?!  Sure you can create your own agent but it doesnt feel like a Syphon Filter game without good old Gabe!  Now he went from being a professional agent to doing paper work.  Well atleast you get to work for him or so you think.  Through the whole game your taking orders from this annoying women(that I cant remember her name) who is always  freaken  yelling and being a smart ass every time you make a mistake. They could of atleast had Gabe tell you what to do because I would respect his opinion at least. Second of all this game is freaken hard.  Your enemies take like 15 shots each even at point blank range and your freaken map is impossible to freaken read.  And your enemies continue to come back to life. You kill all the enemies then you leave then you go back there and all of them are alive shooting you again. I also didn't know what the hell was going on half the time.  All the sudden it would say ""OBJECTIVE FAILED"" and im like ""what objective?"".  Plus in order to beat the game 100% you have to play online.  WHAT THE F***!!!! Since when has anyone made a game were you have to be online to beat it 100%.  I did like a couple things about the game.  It had pretty good graphics and the sound effects were also very realistic.  But overall it just didn't feel like a Syphon Filter game to me. It just had too many mistakes and was just way to frusturating.  Hopefully the next time SONY makes a Syphon Filter game they'll make it right this time!!!!",neutral
1882,"I remember playing my warrior in GW1 with various skill configurations, sometimes as a dps, sometimes as a knockdown-er, sometimes as a spell interrupter. This feature in GW1 reminded me of a card game called Magic The Gathering where you have a plethora of choices for abilities that you needed to limit in a 60-card deck; similarly, GW1 allowed 8 skills in the actionbar which you can configure from maybe more than 100 spell choices, not counting elite spells. That feature is gone.:( The ""heroes"" feature (or ""companions"" feature as some would prefer to call it) is also gone, where you had computer toons to help you in your solo adventures. So GW2 now no longer has the two most favorite features that got me to play GW1, and it is an inferior MMO compared to WoW which I have gotten accustomed to playing over the years.

What seems to be unanimous among all players is that the world is simply beautiful, and I go along with that bandwagon. But gameplay is rather boring. I only have one Guardian class toon currently level 17, and I'm having a hard time continuing due to boredom. There are very few quests, but it does have ""events"" which occur sporadically in the zone you're in; these are worth participating in because they give decent experience points, almost always in the hundreds. Contrast that to killing mobs which give you only about 13 to 20 experience points, you realize quickly grinding simply isn't the way to level up fast in this game.

I'm bored, it's that simple. I spend a lot of time just teleporting around via the waypoints checking for any events in the area. There is no easy way to tell if any event is in progress because your map won't update such information unless you're within the area.

I feel sad. NCSoft stood out among the MMO games because of the above unique features I described. Now it's just another MMO that does not compare to WoW in fun. I can't see myself playing this game too much; since there are no monthly fees, I will still keep it, but I'm simply not impressed at all.",positive

1884,"Dull.  That coupled with jittery rendering, bad physics and horrendously monochromatic enviroments make this RPG rather annoying to play.  I was bored stiff within the first 10 minutes.  I  figured I'd give it an hour...yawn.

The cut scenes are not animated (crude cartoon drawings made to look like they're being clever).  And talk about ""loading""!  I thought Baldur's Gate had a lot, but this one wins the prize.  Sudeki beats the hell out of this game.

Kids may like and eventually come to master the complex battle engine (with three concurrent modes of combat), but the lack of a 'femme fatale' playable/interactive character won't hold the adolescent mind very long.

Worth the wait?  No.  Beautiful to look at?  No, unless all you've been playing lately is Quake.

After all the hype I feel cheated.  I've been made to cough up 50 bucks for a crude psychology experiment.

1885,"EDIT: I will leave my orginal review intact but after playing the game off & on for a month I am frankly bored of this game, uninstalled and move on.

The Cons that Broke the game for me:

1) Instead of you going to quest-givers like a traditional mmo, the quest comes to you in form of dynamic events. The dynamic events are perhaps the most blatant spin Arenanet has been promoting the game with. There is nothing dynamic about them; they are still your traditional kill x & get y just that you might not get to complete all the quests in the chain depending on the level of public participation. But essentially all the quests are exactly the same and you will get to see that if you will level multiple characters. The personal story-line is not more than 10% of the game and doesn't feel epic and didn't really drew me in either.

2) PVP just doesn't have the hold or spice to keep me playing. Everyone is the same faction, well you get different server duking it out but again there are no factions in the game which doesn't immerse me at all in the feeling that they are two distinct sides at war. The three battlegrounds are small, confined and become very repetitive after a while. And here again the lack of two distinct faction just wrecks the feeling of two sides at war. In one game a opposing player has you pissed off and you want to get at him/her only to have that player as your team-member in the next game.

Anyways if I can go back in time I will prevent myself from buying this game and save my $60. Maybe my review might save someone else from buying into the hype and ending up regretting the purchase later.

*************************************************************************************************

Guild Wars 2 is the next evolution in mmo's. It combines the mechanics of a single player rpg with the online gameplay expectations of a mmo and executes it all well. Thus what you get is a story driven mmo without the story-less grind associated with the usual mmo fare of kill x, get y and deliver z. Other than some minor (to me) features missing from a traditional pay-to-play mmo's you get all what you expect from a AAA mmo; personal story-line, huge persistent world, massive scale pvp, battle-ground style pvp, well thought-out and varied classes, huge capital cities, auction house, crafting, dungeons etc.  All of this with the pay-once subscription free model makes this game a no-brainer purchase.

PRO's:
1) The game rewards exploration which is how you level in the game basically. Instead of a traditional go to a city and talk to npc's with marks over their heads for your quests; you just explore your zone, and points of interest which are indicated on your map. In your exploration you will stumble upon many random events happening which you can join in with others or solo and complete the objectives. That was your quest right there along with the XP and your rewards given to you right there in a email so no more running back to a hub and turning your quests in. They are dungeons to do too however I haven't worked on any of them yet.

2) The world is huge, the zones varied, the landscape nicely detailed which helps the zones feel living and breathing. The capital cities are HUGE in scale. To this date I haven't seen all of most cities especially the human capital city Divinity Reach.

3) Finally balanced pvp. In structured pvp  everyone is automatically levelled to max level with all the skills, traits and similar armor. So pretty much it is a battle of skill and strategy not who has the best gear or higher level. As a result the fights last for a long-time even in a group situation and there is no two-shotting in the game. Also no class has permanent stealth which means you don't have to worry about a invisible player stalking and taking 50% or more of your health with the opener. So one can see Arenanet has gone to great lengths to make pvp as equitable and fair as possible. The wwvw pvp zones are huge too and are reminiscent to World of warcraft (old-school) Alterac Valley or to some extent Isle of conquest battle-ground but much bigger, massive and persistent in scale. There is always a battle going on between three different servers for supremacy and whichever server excel results in helpful buffs for the population such as XP increase.

4)Overflow server solution for high number of logins (meaning a seamlessly parallel temporary server) is an excellent solution to waiting as number 1567 and watching the counter time down for who knows how long.

Cons:

1)The one negative I felt with the game is the absence of mounts or taxis to travel between zones. Just magically transporting all over the world kind of breaks the seamless persistent world immersion.

2)Only 5 game wide character slots, and somewhat limited bank storage. More slots or storage needs to be purchased.

Regardless as a whole GW2 has changed the mmo genre. And I can't tell you how liberated I feel with no monthly subscription model of the game that I can play the game as often or as less I want without forcing myself to play to justify paying a monthly sub. So if you are looking for a fantasy mmo that genuinely feels evolved and different from anything else out there in the market Guild Wars 2 is a logical choice to get.",positive
1886,"If anyone ever compares the Ghost Recon series to SOCOM they are completely insane.  SOCOM is so far and away the better game, Ghost Recon 2 is so linear it forces you to play every mission the same way.  Your teammates are useless and will actually grenade themselves more often than not.  At least in SOCOM they would follow your orders once in awhile.  Ghost Recon just has you in front all the time getting shot at while they wait behind.  You're forced to run into ambushes constantly and you can't leave certain sections of the map to try different attack angles.  There are invisible walls set up to keep you trapped like a rat.

1888,"I'm an old school gamer and honestly if your like me and grew up playing Mario, then this game really isn't for you. This game is aimed at a much much much younger audience(Ages 4-10 at the least). Not saying that Mario is an adult game, it has always been a children game, but its difficulty level made it a challenge for everyone. Super Mario Galaxy holds your hand to the very end of the game. The game almost feels like no challenge at all. There is no striving to get that 1up, that special star, or anything really. It's all almost given to you. When I saw I was running around with 9 lives + I knew something was wrong. If you ahve 9 lives+ in a Super Mario game your either the game master or a true gaming beast! In this I was absolutely neither...matter of fact I barely did anything to get there. This game was hardly a challenge at all. Most Mario Games are known for their level of difficulty as Super Mario has never been a breeze to walk through(unless you spent 100hours on it like the Mario pro's). I was dissapointed to see that Nintendo had eased up on the game for the WII release. Of the later Mario games I would say Super Mario 64 was probably the best. It was difficult, challenging, and you had to really play it to beat it. Super Mario Galaxy is a great childrens game for young children, but this by all means is not the Mario that a Nintendo gamer is looking for.",positive

1892,"I've been waiting for this program for months. I've become a Wii exercise junkie. Just about everyday I work out with ""My Fitness Coach"", ""Wii Fit Plus"", and ""More EA active"" (I did workout with the originals but I recently upgraded). So when I found out that there was going to be a fitness program that utilized a camera to measure your proficiency, well I was thinking Flying cars just might not be that far behind. I knew it was going to be good - I mean after all, everyone learned a lesson from ""Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009"" . . . Right . . .

Well, I got the program on release date and worked with it for about 2 hours (Set up and working out). The set up is easy. I was afraid the camera was going to utilize the motion sensor plug spot on my Wii. But no, the camera connects to the USB slot, so there's no need to be switching cables every-time I work with Your Shape. The profile set up is easy enough and of course you have to take a fitness test that gets graded. For some reason the program said I was doing my jumping jacks incorrectly, so my final fitness test grade was a B.

After the test you go into creating your workout schedule. Be careful here because I thought I was just checking out what they call ""Extra Challenges"", but instead ended up starting (and doing) a 30 minute yoga workout.

Now the trouble really starts.
Apparently the Your Shape people thought the annoying feedback chatter in EA Active is charming because I was getting a continuous string of peppy encouragement. At one time, during the corpse poss in yoga, there was nonsensical chatter like ""You can do it"", or ""feel them muscles stretch""or ""do you feel the burn"". I searched the menus for ways to turn off chatter but the best I could do is lower the voice. The yoga section was still pretty good, although in 30 minutes we only used about 8 moves. And BTW, they continued the same mistake in ""My Fitness coach"" where the trainer has you going through a seriers of yoga moves, about 4 times in a row, but unfortunately she only verbalizes the moves the first time. And then there were the workouts. If you have ""My Fitness coach"", then you already have this game. The only difference is ""Your Shape"" uses the camera. I spent a good deal of time requesting that my workouts center on my core and when my first ""Your Shape"" work out started it was just about the same workout I did this morning with My Fitness Coach (as a side not ""My Fitness coach"" used to be called ""Your Self Fitness""). And BTW, there were no real core exercises in my so called focused workout.

Today, I worked out with the program for about 90 minutes. And as I suspected, they took away the workout options that you have with ""My Fitness Coach"". In ""MFC"" you can pick the workout but here it is scheduled. As I stated earlier you can change the focus of the workout-but selecting an AB focus didn't seem to have any effect. Another thing they took away was the ability to pick the type of music you want to hear. The music is okay for Your Shape but I thought MFC did a superior job with the music selection plus you can pick the style you like. Still, I had no real problem with the music with Your Shape.

As far as the camera. The so called center piece of this game, well I was disppointed. As I stated earlier the game did no recognize my arm movements in the Fitness test. It turns out that was a fairly common occurance with some of the other exercises. Additionally there is a slight time lag between when you do the movements and when they appear on screen. And please wear light colored clothing, otherwise you won't really register on the TV screen. I really did not expect stellar video quality on a 70 dollar game. But it is serviceable as far as the game but the movement recognition has me concerned.

If you have ""My Fitness Coach"" or ""Your self Fitness"", don't bother getting ""Your Shape"". If you don't have one of those programs, wait until ""Your Shape"" comes down in price. Your Shape by itself is okay but considering it is really a watered down version of its two prior versions, it is hard to recommend the game.

Two stars because it will work you out, and the camera is a neat idea, but the other versions out there are better.

1893,"Zombies seem to be everywhere. Comics, television, and especially video games. Zombie games have to do a lot to stand out in the crowd now. Dead Island taunted a gorgeous open world and deep RPG driven gameplay, but did it deliver what it promised?

The moment you first lay eyes on the island resort of Banoi, you're most likely going to say something along the lines of ""Wow, this game is beautiful!"" and you'd be right. Everything in Dead Island is very well rendered, from the good to the bad. The palm trees and sand are pleasing to the eyes, and in the same way gashed and chewed up remains are absolutely disgusting. If there is one good thing I have to say about Dead Island it is that the graphics are consistently stunning.

Upon booting up the game, you are presented the choice of 4 different characters. Each character has different specialties and personalities, but unfortunately none of them are likable. All of the playable characters are an annoying stereotype, from the football jock to the coky feminist , and they just had to throw in a gangster black guy to boot. Add on top of that that none of them had any reason to vacation to the island aside from getting drunk and partying and you just don't really care if they survive or not.

The game controls from the first person perspective and is for the most part an RPG. You take on quests from other island survivors and, as you complete more story related quests new areas are opened to you. One area where the game falls short is that it is not nearly as open as it claims to be. Once you unlock all the areas, it is decently large but the island is still not that big. In the end, you're pretty much made to stay in the area where the story is unfolding unless you want to be completely bored to death. Killing zombies and completing quests awards you with experience, and as you level up you acquire skill points to buy upgrades and abilities with.

Another area the game falls short is the weapons. The game was supposed to be about improvising and using what is around you, but instead there are only a handful of items that can be used as weapons. Fortunately these weapons can be upgraded to break the monotony, but that still isn't enough. For example, if you have a baseball bat and 2 nails, you make a spiked bat. This is cool, but doesn't save the game from the fact that there are very few weapons. As you use weapons, they degrade. Guns become less accurate and strong, and pipes bend and rust. Use them enough and the weapon will break. This is kind of a neat feature, but ultimately the fact that you will likely find another weapon just like it soon causes you to only care so much. On top of that, combat eventually just gets repetitive and boring to the point that you hope you don't tun into another enemy - and not because you're dying.

Overall, Dead Island is very pretty, but that does not save it from mediocre gameplay that doesn't live up to any of its promises. Perhaps if I had known nothing about the game prior to my purchase, I would have enjoyed it more. I watched all the prerelease trailers and read most of the articles about it before it came out. I expected a wonderful, beautiful, open world zombie game. It may have delivered on the beautiful part, but the gameplay is fairly linear despite the side quests and the combat gets old quickly. There are plenty of toher zombie games out there that are much more worthy of your money and your time.",positive
1894,"I am a big fan of racing games, especially on console. I have most of the racing games (Project Cars, Need for Speed, etc) and thought that I'd buy this one just to see how it was. The graphics are some of the best I've seen, however, every time you turn no mater what speed you are going the tires squeel. It is very unrealistic as far as physics as well and the turning radius and grip of most cars is off by a lot. If you are looking for a realistic racing sim with some great cars then I would recommend Project Cars, if you want an easier racing game that is still somewhat realistic, try either the new Need for Speed or for PS3 users I would recommend Need For Speed: The Run.",positive
1895,"This is not a great game.  It's not even a good game -- just a solidly mediocre one.  And who has the time and money for mediocre games?  After the towering glory that was Resident Evil 4, I anticipated a nigh religious gaming experience, and that was what I should have gotten.  And yeah, before you get all ""you expect too much"" on me, I'll tell you this:  if you don't expect a *hellaciously* good time from entertainment software that runs fifty-to-sixty bucks a pop, you're either eating dodo sandwiches and blowing your nose on Franklins, or you're waaaaay too easy to please.

Okay, before I go into my grievances, here are some positives:  I like the basic zombie shooting, punching and kicking.  The two-player mode is a terrific thing to put in an RE game, and the ability to revive your dying partner if you reach him/her before he/she sinks to the ground is really cool and dramatic.  Firefights with gun-wielding soldier zombies later in the game are often fun -- I was surprised at that, actually.  The female characters are really cute, and it was good to see Jill Valentine again (though I don't like how they narrowed down the womanly hips she sported in the Gamecube Resident Evil remake).

Now my grievances:  Most of the maps are boring, confusing, and don't usually support the gameplay mechanics very well -- it seems like they're either too big or too small.  With the exception of one in which you help Jill out whilst avoiding an invincible Wesker, the boss battles are all phoned in, the big, wriggly snake beast encounters being some of the lamest.  All the characters are as *blaaah* as they come, personality-wise; they just say the same dumb, flat things over and over and over again, things like ""I should have killed you years ago, pesky, foolish hero!"" and ""Hey partner, we're partners to the very end, right partner?"" and ""What are you talking about villain?  You're mad, mad I say!""  It's alright to say stuff like that here and there in any action game (or movie, for that matter), but not all the rootin' tootin' time!  And why did they turn Chris into such a 'roid monster?  Sure, he was a big, tough guy in the other games, but jeeez!  And one last thing:  the African setting wasn't exploited to even near its full atmospheric potential (unlike RE4, which takes place in rural Spain and has European gothic fLaYvA to the MAX).

Don't tell me this game is at least as good as RE4, because it ain't.  I went back and immediately replayed it after beating RE5, and it is just so much better.  Better gameplay, better graphics (yeah I said it, alright; they're not as shiny and hi-res, but they ARE better), better characters, better story . . . it's just better.

1896,"Wanted this game to be good, but was disappointed.

Good:
Character creation - You get to make your soldier how you like him granted you have enough points. If you want him to carry an RPG and be a medic, go for it, but then you won't have points for things like Heavy Armor, grenades, scopes, etc.

Maps - Good design with some action focal points. Looking for an enemy to shoot won't be a problem.

Graphics - They aren't stellar or anything, but I think they get the job done for the scale MAG has achieved.

Bad:
Sound - Audio is seriously lacking, from gunfire to explosions. It sounds horrible compared to other FPS games out there today.

No Environment Destruction - Not asking for Battlefield Bad Company destruction, but when a weak wooden fence is in your way, you should be able to bust through it. Also, an enemy shouldn't be able to hide behind it.

128 vs 128? - This isn't true. Yes there are 256 players at once. However, because there are 8 different objectives split into pairs in four sections, it basically becomes four 32 vs 32 battles taking place at the same time. So now, we have a 32 vs 32 game with subpar graphics and horrible sound.

MAG just isn't want you think it is going to be. You aren't going to look out onto the horizon and see 120 players battling another 120 players. Its scattered small battles on huge maps with graphics and sound that don't measure up to the competition.",neutral
1897,"Well, I finished it, and I still hate it. I first tried this game one year ago and couldn't get past the frustration induced by the first few chapters. At that time I rated the game a mere 2/10. I thought I might be more open to this game now, and sure enough I was, but I still greatly disliked the experience. I'd give the game a 3.5/10 now.

WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead. (And ranting, much ranting.)

The only thing this game has going for it is that it successfully instills the desire to determine who the real killer is. This aspect alone is what kept me playing. Hats off to director David Cage. The plot in this game is phenomenal! ...

... Until the ending. The game creates a number of loose ends and false twists that keep driving you forward, but rather than tying everything together and letting you figure out who the killer is on your own, the game unceremoniously throws the answer at you. ""Oh by the way the killer is this guy. Carry on."" What a great way to end an otherwise amazing plot line... Not. Of course, the game can't end the disappointment there. Oh no! Instead Heavy Rain leaves several loose ends unaccounted for, almost as if they never existed at all.

The delivery of the plot is dreadful. The game created no emotional attachment to the story. I didn't care who had to die or suffer along the way for me to learn the truth. With such a blatant disconnect between the player and the game, I may as well have been the killer myself. The story fails to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. Part of this issue comes from the entirely unconvincing acting. Madison is the only character with even a semi-decent voice actor. Everyone else in this game was utterly worthless. Ethan's and Jayden's actors are among the worst I've ever heard.

The interactions of the first few chapters gave me the impression that I would achieve the same outcome regardless of which choices I made during the dialogues. I attempted to intimidate the whore, but then that didn't work and I was forced to select the compassionate option. I attempted to ignore bits of evidence at the crime scene but was forced to complete the investigation. No player decision making there either. What gives? That doesn't seem to hold up to the promise of ""How this story unfolds is entirely up to [me]."" I suppose I could have decided to fail the origami missions, but I don't think it's worth suffering through the game again to find out if this promise holds true.

The seemingly irrelevant decision points just barely scratch the surface of this game's problems. The main source of my angst is that the mechanics are outright awful. At one point I literally quit playing because the character would not move in the direction he needed to go. Holding R2 to move is probably the poorest control scheme implementation I've ever seen in a game. More annoyances are that you can't read any options when you are prompted to speak and QTE cues ether disappear off screen before you have a chance to use them or they fly around so wildly that you can't tell which button you need to press.

Heavy Rain's content is yet another item in my litany of disappointments. The game forces you to see a shower scene full of female nudity. There is also a sex scene in the game that makes absolutely no sense in the plot and doesn't come close to correlating with the character development. The fight with Mad Jack was particularly horrible. I just stopped bothering to play after a few minutes of watching the weak FBI agent slapping a big black man. I rather enjoyed watching Jayden get flattened under a tractor, it sure beat the pitiful excuse for a fight I had been watching. The final stand off against the origami killer is just as bad. One thing is for certain, while playing this game you will never find yourself saying that the suspension is palpable; it's certainly anything but.

Playing this game was an utterly frustrating chore. Although part of me would like to see how the story would change if I played differently, I don't care to play the game again to find out. I'd rather watch a low-budge drama movie than play through this game again. At least then I wouldn't have to perform menial controller movements while watching the story play out.

My opinion after my first play/quit: AVOID!
My opinion after finishing the game: avoid.

For reference, here is an article quoting Cage claiming Heavy Rain is not a video game. A few words of advice: focus more on making it play like a video game so people don't have to suffer while uncovering the ""interactive drama.""

1902,"As a huge fan of the DA series, I've been waiting for this game for a long time. I was even more excited that they would be releasing a 360 version and I didn't have to buy a new console.  But so far this game is such a huge disappointment.

When I first loaded the game, I noticed that despite the install the 2nd disc was still spinning furiously like nothing I've ever heard before. Ok, maybe its because the graphics are good----nope. The very first scene, I thought it looked like legos. It has worse graphics than the first DA!  Whenever a scene or map loads, you can literally see the textures loading and watch a peach blob become a somewhat recognizable face as the scene progresses. I understand they compressed/downgraded the xbone version to work with 360, but this is unacceptable for a $60 game. Despite installing and the overly low res graphics, I still have to wait several minutes between every scene, warp, open door for loading time.

I've spent much more time loading, and restarting than playing the game. At around 16 hrs in, the game would just freeze during cut scenes or when loading a map with a ""disc unreadable"" error. After some searching, I realized it was not just me, but was happening to lots of 360 users. I can no longer progress forward since this behemoth of a game, that still manages to have glitches and garbage graphics, keeps crashing.

Do game studios not have testers anymore? Or is it all rush the half-assed product to the market, overcharge people and maybe we can patch it later? It's really a shame, because the story is pretty good. Now if only they'd make it a playable game. EA/Bioware owe all the 360 users a refund for this garbage (frankly, they should've charged less to 360 users in the first place knowing they were getting a sub-par product).",neutral
1903,"I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the first Pool of Radiance series.  It was the first computer game to bring a great PC version of a popular RPG to fruition.  I also played the Black Isle/Bioware versions of the AD&D series (Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale) and loved those games.  But this one?  I think my review would be censored if I told you what I thought of this game.
First of all, the game crashed on installation!  Blizzard may be the only software company that releases relatively bug-free PC games these days but how can a software company justify a game with bugs in the installation process?!  I've heard that I have it lucky.  Some people have had their operation systems wiped out in the installation process.
After getting the game to run, I was unimpressed.  The graphics are decent but it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the other recent Dungeons & Dragons products.  It's a ""hack and slash"" only game and things such as quests, great storylines and character interaction which made so many of the Dungeons & Dragons games enjoyable are non-existent in this product.  The instruction manual is also a poor substitute for an introduction to the new 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules.
I'm afraid that the more I play this game, the more technical errors I'm going to find.  There are already many bugs such as the game crashing when you save it during certain conditions.  I can live with a bugged game if it promises to offer great gameplay when it is fixed with patches but this game is a pitiful attempt to live up to some of the great successes the Dungeons and Dragons series has seen with PC games.
Don't waste your money.  If you're an avid D&D fan, wait until the game price drops and then try it out but I'd recommend Baldur's Gate II as a much better alternative if anyone desires a great RPG game for the PC.",neutral

1906,"I enjoyed the first few levels of this game mostly, but then the Free Fall parts came, and they are terrible!  I only write reviews if i've beaten games, and this is the first review i'll write without beating a game, because i'm pretty sure i'll never care to beat it. I'm just tired of instant kills, that just feel cheap, and completely rob me of any enjoyment I was having.  I should also note I don't play multiplayer, so this review is only for the single player campaign.

Pros:
* Stupid pretty
* Voice actioning is mostly good.
* controls while shooting people feel awesome.  (Love that there isn't any auto-aim.)
* The illusion of choice

Cons:
* Campaign is kind really boring. Large levels with little to no-one in them
* A protection mission for a homicidal maniac that is terribly programed. Expect cheap deaths all around, and to make it worse I didn't have any interest in protecting her! It's not Ellie from Last Of Us
* Free Fall sections are basically cheap deaths, and i feel ike i'm playing a pretty version of COT.  That is bad!
* The missions change locations from forest, to space, to slums, to city, back to space, to falling and it all makes no sense.
* The story is boring, and again makes no sense.
* Your character is a tool and for a guy thats all about choosing his own way is pretty useless.

If your buying this game to show off your PS4 and to play muti-player you'll probably be fine, if your a solo gamer like me.  Don't buy it!!!! you'll hate yourself for it.  I gave the game two stars one for being pretty, and one for the more open level design for the illusion of choice.

EDIT: I forced myself the beat the game. And the free fall section do end, but the game didn't get any better.  The game falls apart into a corridor shooter.  And i experienced some major glitches that robbed me of my satisfying boss battle.

Basically in the second to last area you fight a boss that uses a shockwave that disrupts the drone.  So i started running away from him to try and get some space between us.  some how I lost him, and was looking around hoping i could get some shots into his back, and suddenly he appeared in front of me dead. It was so anti-climatic it was just another thing that robbed me of any fun i was having.

The game feels rushed, like they wanted to make launch and sacrificed a ton of game play mechanics they set up in the beginning to get the game out in time.",negative
1907,"Bought the game as digital download, all I have to say is that I wish they gave us Forza Horizon 2 on Playstation. This game was an utter disappointment. There are invisible walls making me feel like I am 6 years old playing with bumper lanes when I bowled... Wish I could ask sony for a refund. The driving mechanics don't feel anything different from Need For Speed. The only thing that this game has over any other racing game is the background scenery. That is it...

Pros: -good scenery and lighting
  -good audio engineering

Cons: -Horrible driving mechanics (gta V has better car physics and handling)
  -AI ruins single player
  -Online still doesn't work for me
  -Tracks are incredible boring and all feel the same
  -All cars handle and feel the same, but sound different.

Verdict: The game is designed for beginners or little kids who just want to jump in and start playing a racing game. Sadly, it is the only option for ps4 owners in terms of racers along with need for speed rivals. If you want a game with realistic driving mechanics, then wait out for project cars or buy a PC and play Grid AutoSport. DriveClub is far from realistic.",neutral

1909,"i love megaman, so capcom's neglect of that franchise has always bothered me. This collection, though I appreciate that megaman still even exists in this capacity, bothers me mostly because there are 6 games, the megaman 1-6 titles from NES. I would've paid more for more games included, even the Anniversary collection on ps2/gc/xbox had 1-8 and the 2 CPS2 arcade games, and being able to play 9, 10, or Megaman and Bass, if it included all of those i would've paid full price for the game no issue (i paid $14 for this). It just felt like it was kind of a cop out and i'm not sure why only the NES 6 games were included. It's not like i'm asking for Rockman board game to be translated.

There are a couple good things the collection does do however,
1. challenges which grab bits and pieces from whatever games it wants and pastes them together
2. switching between megaman and rockman (japanese version)
3. customizable controls
4. for the most part, maintaining original game performance as far as lag and sprite problems go. Yes, MM1 still instantly drops you at terminal velocity if you step off of a platform without jumping.

i'm not sure who this is targeting because for younger players, traditional megaman probably feels pretty dated, and older players that like megaman probably have already played these or own these in some capacity. Though capcom, we could still use a collection of the gameboy games... (Rockman World 1-5, MM Xtreme series on GBC, so on...)",negative

1911,"Final Fantasy X  is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square as the tenth entry in the Final Fantasy series. The game marks the Final Fantasy series transition from entirely pre-rendered backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas, and is also the first in the series to feature voice acting. Final Fantasy X replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the ""Conditional Turn-Based Battle"" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the ""Sphere Grid"".

Set in the fantasy world of Spira, the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a blitzball star who finds himself in Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the summoner Yuna on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.

Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.

The gameplay of Final Fantasy X differs from that of previous Final Fantasy games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In Final Fantasy X, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X features numerous minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport ""blitzball""

Final Fantasy X introduces the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system in place of the series' traditional Active Time Battle system first used in Final Fantasy IV. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. ""Limit Breaks"", highly-damaging special attacks, reappear in Final Fantasy X as ""Overdrives"". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.

Final Fantasy X introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the ""Aeons"" of Final Fantasy X arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests

The game has enjoyed high review scores from Japanese and Western critics. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu and Famitsu PS2 awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score, and readers of the former magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006. Another Japanese gaming magazine, The Play Station, gave the game a score of 29/30. Famitsu, Famitsu PS2, and The Play Station expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline, graphics, and movies. The game maintains a 91% approval rating on GameRankings and 92 out of 100 on Metacritic. Producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that the overall reception to the game was ""excellent"", having received praise and awards from the media.

IGN's David Smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. They also felt that the game's graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game as a whole was ""the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well"". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clich&eacute;s commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was ""diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game"". Similarly, GamePro described its character building system and battle system as ""two of the best innovations in the series"". The visuals of the game were commended by GameSpy's Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as ""top-notch"", as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted most of them were ""above average"" and called the music ""rich"".

Edge rated the game considerably lower, criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as ""nauseating"", particularly panning Tidus. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer criticized the game's linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell noted that the game's puzzle segments were ""depressing"" and ""superfluous"", and that although the Sphere Grid was ""a nice touch"", it took up too much of the game. The linearity of the game was positively commented on by GamePro who stated that a player would not be required to participate in side-quests or the mini-game to reach the game's conclusion, finding some of them unappealing. Game Revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped, some even being too long.",neutral

1915,"I bought this game and spent 2 hours trying to play it. First of all, the graphics are so cartoonish, I had to just crack up. All of the players look like their 5 foot tall and 300 lbs including the quarterback and recievers!. They all look like their on steroids and they hunch around the field like large gorillas. I was laughing through the entire 2 hours. When the quarterback throws a pass, it looks like he's aiming at a dart board for god sakes, it's just hilarious!. I have played 4 seasons on all of the EA Sports College Football up through 07 and have enjoyed every minute!. The graphics on EA are just so much better, not to say EA is perfect. EA is far from perfect but the graphics are much better. The quarterback and receivers are the right shape and size and the linemen are chunky like they should be. And also on EA, when the recievers, runningback and quarterback run with the ball, the speed is right on. If a lineman picks up a fumble, he lumbers with it cause he's obviousely 250-300 pounds and he's slow and always gets tackled. This puts EA over the top. The quarterback in EA has his full-range of motion of his arm as he's passing the ball. In 2K3, the 5 foot 300 lb gorilla looking quarterback is throwing at a imaginary dart board (hoaky to say the least). Don't waste your hard earned dollars on this game. If you really want to get a good football game get 2k5 football (NFL). This was put out by 2K games not Sega. Every Sega game I have is worthless except for any of their baseball. The baseball games put out by Sega are very very good. So if you have to have College football and want the best, get EA (any EA college football game will do).",positive

1918,"I wouldn't say I was super hyped for the game but I believe Blizzard was on their game when it comes to both balance in the game itself but more importantly the mechanics outside of the game.  The matchmaking system, not including the team composition, is a rather horrible mix of World of Warcraft and StarCraft II.  The 6 v 6 is very similar to WoW dungeons (tanks, heals, DPS) in which to really get the game to its peak you'd need at least 8 or so friends to get a good team (more or less like raids, one won't get the same people on every single time, etc.).  While this is merely my speculation I've noticed that Blizzard is locking me in with a 50/50 win ratio which is how they approach StarCraft II's ranking systems.  Win 10 games?  I WILL definitely lose the next 10-15 games.  I don't mean like 'it was so close' sort of losing but the flat out being grouped with people who, despite being level 40+, have no idea how to play Overwatch and assume it's a free for all.  Admittedly I don't have many friends who play Overwatch and my neighbor says he got tired of how absurd trying to get that one 'First Win of the Day' is.

Pros:
-Great graphics, characters and designs.
-Runs nearly flawlessly on my older Core 2 Quad with a GeForce 660 series card.
-When in a good group, especially when the matches get tense and we lose anyway, it's still enjoyable.
-While it does not support LAN the game does have nicely designed spectator UI for custom games.  It's great to know that they've got the competitive framework in place and it's easy to watch tournaments and understand what is going on (namely, the spectator is third person with health bars showing all players on the top).
-Mostly balanced, although there are a few paper, rock, scissors matchups to avoid.
-While it's still easy to break apart teams in Quick Play I've noticed players who understand how to properly utilize their class tend to have a very nice synergy.

Neutral:
-Blizzard has implemented a system to where if a player quits so many games they get a penalty of reduced experience.  I can imagine the lack of a concede is probably because it is possible to still win, despite all odds.
-To make the game more entertaining there is an overtime styled sudden death.  If time runs the match is placed in overtime if the losing team has the slight probability of overtaking the winning team.  Of course, who finds it great would vary on the match obviously.

Cons:
-Blizzard should of taken it a step further and added a sort of ""guild"" or ""roster"" system to where players can have a premade group that they can join and leave at will.  Currently trying to get a group going requires everyone to be at the menu with no way to try and queue with a friend outside of simply joining their game (which, not only does the game split us up afterwards but I'm generally playing against them) if something is in progress.  I don't mind waiting 4 minutes to join a friend rather than 16 trying to figure out how to align our matches.
-There is way too much time spent on the character select screen at the beginning of a match.  On maps that are not capturing the point the attacking team can wait up to 2 minutes before getting into the game (that is, sixty seconds for the round to start as well as 40 seconds at the character select...Providing it does not reset).
-It really has nothing to keep me playing.  As great as the game was when it came out after two weeks I find myself only putting in less than an hour into it on a daily basis.  Unless I can get a nice premade group it's too difficult to get into.
-I am not a big fan of statistics on Quick Play.  I can obviously understand it competitively but it's meaningless otherwise (and like WoW an eyesore).  I'd not even care about losing if the total number of games isn't recorded.

Edit: This review predates the new Competitive system, so I don't know if they did add a team system.",positive
1919,"Well Level 5 had to start somewhere. So they gave us this... a blend of a roguelike dungeon crawler and Soul Blazer town rejuvenating. This game has its charms, and in the beginning is actually kind of fun. Crafting your own weapons and designing the town layouts are the strongest highlights. However, about midway through the charm wears off, and the formula becomes all too tedious. Basically Level 5 took what should be a 12 hour game and used time wasting methods to stretch that out to 30 hours. To see things through to the end, you'll need a mountain of patience and a bit of a masochistic streak (especially for the last boss). Supposedly Dark Cloud 2 (AKA Dark Chronicle) fixes all the problems this game has. So I would suggest skipping this one and going straight to its sequel instead.",negative

When you go from track to track during the career mode you've got the same stupid commentator saying ""So and so really moved in the point standing after last weeks race."", they say this EVERY time.  How hard is it to record a few different statements?  The graphics are okay and the physics engine is pretty good but not good enough to make up for the rest of the game.  They should have added more to the career mode, like getting offers from sponsers depending on how you're doing.  Hiring and firing crew chiefs and spending your earnings to keep you car running and to buy upgrades and stuff.  When the ... will game developers learn that they are leaving out most of the reality in these games?  Rent it, beat it, and buy something else.

- Audio commentary by Jon Miller and Joe Morgan

- There's no feel to pitching or hitting. A homerun feels the same as a single. Pitching is a disaster.

1926,"I enjoyed this game at first, but it didn't take too long

to put the shortcomings under my thumb.  The environments are really good,

and the cutscenes (not even my thing) are amazing!  The whipping combat

may entertain you for a while, but it doesn't balance out the bad platforming sections.

It took me a while to even understand what buttons and directions to enable

in order to get my sorry kiester across the many cliffs you'll run into.  I can't tell

you how many times I wanted to jump somewhere, and all I did was plummet.  The combat

can be complex, as you have light and dark energy to use and charge.  The upgrade system is straightforward,

but some moves require the goofiest button combo's ever.  The gameplay's relatively smooth in regards

to framerate, but becomes rigid as far as the character's movement is concerned.  You may have heard

that you're bound to run into confusion while searching for how to progress.  The stationary cam is the prime suspect

in regards to this matter.  You should've seen the quizical look on my face when I accidently found my way

to the next area, while the camera didn't even show how I got there.  You don't want to see my face, as I get stuck again.

Where to go?  Where to go?  I've had enough.  When you get weapon upgrades, you can replay previous levels

to find new stuff.  This is one of those games in which the varying aspects of gameplay are contradictory.

The simple nature of combat and platforming contrast with the complexity of finding keys, useless combo's and

broken cliff diving.  Don't get me wrong, I got some kicks in, but grew tired only 25% of the way through.

The boss fights can either be complicated (due to platforming, timing and trial and error) or grueling (widdling

down combat).  **software  Complete at your own peril.",negative
1927,"If you like installing a game, and having it install a copy protection program which will remain on your computer long after you uninstall the game (you have to reformat the hard drive to get rid of it), Spore is for you.

The game itself is decent, and it's broken up into five stages.  The first is trivial, but since the game is new to the player, it's not awful.  Stage two is either a lame ""simon says"" program, or a trivially simple mini combat game.  After that, the game becomes a fairly average RTS.  In Spore, you get to choose parts for your creature, then dress them up, then choose the look of buildings and vehicles.  None of it is terrible, none of it is the great new thing many people expected.  Gameplay is safe, some fun, but nothing exciting.

Which makes Spore an overpriced, fairly average, Real-Time-Strategy game with pretty pictures and an offensive Digital Rights Management tool which you might see mentioned elsewhere in the reviews.  Spore's copyright scheme reminds me of a guy who parks a totally ordinary sports car diagonally across two spaces because he thinks it's the greatest thing there is.

1929,"Sonic Adventure DX is supposed to be a nearly identical copy of the Sega Dreamcast title, Sonic Adventure, but something drastic has been lost in its translation to the GameCube.  This game is severely lacking the feel of its Dreamcast version and, on top of that, it seems to be full of glitches.
The first flaw most players will notice are the very akward camera angles.  In this version of the game, players have very little control over the game's camera and, as a result, will often have their characters suffer death from an unseen enemy or pit.
The second flaw players will likely notice are the glitches in the game's platforms.  While progressing through certain levels, players can suddenly find their characters falling through floors and walls that *should* be solid and impermeable.  (The passability glitches in the floors and walls always occur in the same places, so players *can* avoid them once learning where they are.)
If you are willing to deal with the frustration of frequent, random character death, then you might find this game to be a lot of fun.  Otherwise, you should probably avoid it and find a good platform title elsewhere.",positive
1930,"I loved the first two Gabriel Knight games (""Sins of the Father"" and ""The Beast Within""). They were creepy, well-researched, and had great atmosphere.
Well, ""Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires! Neat! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential.
To give you an example of what I mean, one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so Gabriel can get from one place to another. A perfectly good motor scooter (I think; it's been a while) is available. But noooooo ... Gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy. He has to have a big motorcycle. So that's the puzzle -- getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ride.
Let me get this straight. He's a detective trying to solve a case, but he's going to waste time finding a cooler ride?
That was the point where I threw the game out the window, so I can't comment on how it ends, unfortunately. The voice acting was pretty lame; I don't know who told Tim Curry he could do a New Orleans accent, but he can't.

Go to the next area, kill the monsters there (without the Resident Evil save-your-ammo-like-your-life-depends-on-it stratedgy which made Res Evil games so edgy), get the item, solve the obligatory puzzle, repeat.  The 'horror' aspect of Resident Evil games is completely gone which makes this one a bit heavy on the cheesy and not-so-challenging side.
It's also REAL short.
Good graphics, not so go voice overs, not too compelling storyline (save the princess...groan!).
I was disappointed, but I guess I might be in the minority.",positive
1940,"I played the late beta of this game and it was buggy as all get out.  I'm thankful for that because I was going to get it until I played it.  From what I've seen since, it still has lots of problems.  Bioware is milking the Star Wars license for all it's worth, charging a premium price for a non premium product.  It's fun in parts, but much of it is the same old, same old MMORPG.  Think World of Warcraft with a Star Wars skin, except for the voicing of missions in TOR.  There are better free to play MMORPG's out there right now.",positive
1941,"I came across Beach Head 2000 and decided to give it a shot, wanting a diversion from writing code.  Unfortunately, it isn't anything like the five star reviewers suggest.
This game would be perfect for children (who aren't technically sophisticated) to keep them occupied for about half a day (maybe more for children that are ""special"").  After that, it's more an exercise in repetition than entertainment.  Another plus is that the graphics are mediocre, so no expensive graphics card (or fast CPU) is required.  Adults will be bored within 30 minutes if even that long.
So, I have to agree with the one star reviewers on this one.  The game is reminiscent of the arcade games in the 80's, where you do the same thing again, and again, only faster.  It gets boring quickly.
If you run out of ammunition (and you will), you can't do anything except wait to be killed.
It is a one star game, but I gave it two stars because grandparents can use it to distract their grandchildren for an hour or two, on an underpowered PC.",positive
1942,"A few things about the game, the controls are horrible, steering is poor at best.  I can never win a race or let alone have a chance of winning because of the oversteer on these trucks.  I'm 34 and me and my son whose 5 play this game, he has fun driving around and wrecking things.  As far as racing he doesnt know any better.",neutral
1943,"Was a great product in the beginning. These were my first gaming headset, so I was very impressed with the sound. The quality though was much to be desired. They lasted nearly 6 months before falling apart around. The plastic was very cheap and begun to crack until it eventually gave way and was no longer usable. I was very careful with these and they still fell apart. I wouldn't buy them again.",positive
1944,"The campaign, I should open with that.  Games that are not explicitly online multiplayer (e.g. Battlefield series) should have a strong campaign that is more than a extended training system for multiplayer.  I often felt so frustrated when I couldn't get past a part (Driving the tank across the ice while being bombed) after several tries that I had to put the game down and play something else or just read a book.  While the story was much better than I had expected, it left a lot out and sometimes just made no sense (The lab... did the humans create the Locust?  I couldn't tell).

The game play was ok, there was enough variety in weapons to be fun without being confusing (Though I played most of the game with only the chainsaw gun and sniper rifle, occasionally a grenade but never a pistol unless I ran out of ammo for everything else) but the game just felt lacking.  I know, vague, but much of the game played the same way; get under cover, fire until everything is dead, find next cover, repeat.  The few times when you were given a chance to ride in/on something ended quickly and at times mind numbingly frustrating.  The ending was a little blah, circle the super-monster-bomb while it was bombarded by orbital satellites until it exploded, not that interesting considering you were riding that monster before it decided to mutate.

Multiplayer is just boring.  The game systems function great against the AI but when playing with other people it again was slow and often a situation of who had the biggest gun or brought a friend.  The game played like so many games before it, but couldn't pull it off as well.  I would rent this game, it is not worth owning.  Keep hold of Halo 3 and wait for Recon, those have the online gaming thing down.",negative
1945,This game is a waste of time. Very poor graphics and controls. Gameplay is good. I would not recommend this game.,negative
1946,"So before I list the negatives about this game, I would like to first give it credit where it is due. The online multiplayer (when it works), is an absolute blast. The amount of environment manipulation available ensures that no two rounds will ever go down the exact same way. Furthermore, the looks of the game are decent, as well as the controls and overall atmosphere.

That being said, there are enough negatives to bring this game down to 2 stars, at least for me. First and foremost, a common issue that many people have been complaining about is the status of the Rainbow Six servers. Even writing this review, at least a month after release, the servers have presented a massive gameplay issue; in the course of an hour of playing, you will loose connection to the server at least once, and in between these losses, the quality of gameplay ranges substantially (some games are super smooth, others are incredibly glitchy). While this is obviously not a negative about the game itself, it is a substantial detriment to the overall playability, especially considering that there is not much of a single player campaign, which leads perfectly to the next issue.

If you wish to play a single player campaign, similar to the ones in Rainbow six Vegas, or even campaigns in earlier games, you will be heavily disappointed. Instead of an actual campaign, Rainbox Six Siege is instead composed of 10 different 'situations,' increasing in difficulty as you progress, but leaving the player with an absolute lack of a premise or story (especially in contrast to earlier Rainbow Six games). Honestly, playing through them almost seemed pointless, like I was playing more of a tutorial than an actual campaign; better get used to it though considering how often the servers have gone down post-release.

Content is also a little bit of an issue in this game, at least for me. In the multiplayer version of the game, there are 20 different operators (10 for attacking; 10 for defending), that you may choose from, all with their own special ability. I absolutely love the some of the special abilities, and the big learning curve that comes with understanding how to use them most effectively. That being said, the amount of actual content beyond the operators is lacking. For starters, in each operator class, you may only choose one of 2 firearms (many are repeats among different classes). Once you choose the firearms, customization typically starts and ends with the gun sight (there are a few) and the camo pattern on the firearm. Beyond that, unlike previous rainbow six games where you could truly make the operator unique to you, you are unable to customize the look of your operator at all.

This game is another in a long line of games that expects the buyer to not only buy into part of a game, but also spend another $30 bucks on a season pass in order to more 'complete' the game. That being said, after you spend your money, you will still be left void of a campaign/story, operator customization, and adequate servers to actually play the game on.

My recommendation, wait for the price of this game to drop! Do not buy it until it is on sale. Hopefully, between now and then, the issues with the servers will be worked out; but truthfully, as fun as this game is (in its heavily limited state), it is not enough fun to warrant that $60 price tag, with a $30 season pass to add what should already be in the game.",positive
1947,"why couldn't they make the game to where you could just go straight to skating competitions in front of screaming fans & earning big bucks. here's something else: retro decks IN THE FISHTALE SHAPE not the bannana board, man i hate the bannana board.

1949,"This product could be dangerous if you expect it to calculate a ""balanced diet"" for you. What it means by ""balanced"" is that the calories of the food you have consumed are sufficient to ""balance"" the calories you have expended. I had been reporting the food I had eaten (you pull various food icons from the different food groups over to a cartoon figure) for over a week but one day, when I had eaten too many carbs and not enough vegetables, I started to get uneasy. While the program said the diet was ""balanced"" I knew it was not nutritionally balanced. The next day I calculated my food exchanges on a piece of paper, but instead of what I had actuall eaten I put down that I had consumed nothing but chicken. The program said this diet was ""balanced"". The next day I did the same thing, only instead of what I had actually eaten I told the program I had eaten nothing but candy. Again, it said my diet was ""balanced"".

This game is good in that it offers incentive to exercise, and a lot of good information about nutrition. It is a shame that it fell short when it came to the ""food balance"" part. Surely information about the food pyramid and healthy food exchanges is not too difficult to program into a game? Instead of the wonky pedometer, the manufacturers could have included a small calorie counter.

I think Nintendo DS would be a great platform for a program that encourages exercise *and* helps you select a balanced diet. I am looking forward to it.",neutral
1950,"I waited and waited for this game to be released. At first, it seemed much better than Wii Sports Bowling, but the fun soon wore off.

Multiplayer mode sometimes works, and sometimes does not. Half the time it makes you use the same remote for 2 players. I've found that cancelling out of the game and starting over will allow 2 remotes to be used with 2 players. I think it may have something to do with your choice of players.

I've been playing career mode for about 6 months now, and I am STILL using the house ball.  I cannot gain enough money to buy a new ball ([...]).

However, 3 things annoy me the most.  About every five seconds, there is a voice in the background. it sounds like an Indian male shouting ""Yamani"".  This is really annoying, over and over and over and over.  I have read a ton of reviews and this fact is never mentioned.

Another really annoying thing is the physics and sounds are not at all realistic.  When you get a strike - it ALWAYS makes the same exact strike sound, regardless of how you get the strike. You can get 8 pins, and by some miracle the next 2 pins fall - you still hear the same strike sound - yet no sound when the last 2 pins fall. When you hit 2 pins, always the same sound, regardless of how close or far apart the pins are. When you hit a single pin, always the same sound - you get the picture.

Splits are impossible to pick up. You can throw the ball dead in the pocket and not get a strike (I know beforehand by the sound of the pins). But pins bash into each other, yet do not fall. It's like this game is programmed once the ball is rolled - it seems pre-determined how many pins you will get, as opposed to the real physics of bowling.

The third annoying thing is ball control - there is practically none. i can hold my arm perfectly straight throughout the delivery of the ball, yet it will hook left.  I deliberately try to hook the ball left, and it hooks right.  i don't get it.  The screenshots show meters on the screen for accuracy and strrength - where are they?

I still plal, because of all the time I have invested in this game, I am determined to get out of ""amateur' status - even though in league Night, I win almost every single game, and by a lot.  I generally bowl 180 or better every game in league night - I just cannot win a tournament - then have to start over with 27 league games again.

Ryse has ""combat"" button mashing, but you have to do it the same way each time practically against every enemy you face. The graphics of course are the high point of this game (just like 99% of current video games), with a story that is as transparent and 1 dimensional as water. The boss battles are EXCEPTIONALLY annoying. Be prepared to ""be defeated"" in every section of this game.

I have only had the keyboard for a week but have had to reload software sevral times (seems to be the same problem I had with short lived Razer Death Adder Mouse).

1962,"i played this for about 4 hours and i definitey understand why this sold poorly. its just not that much fun. it has a well designed world, strong ability to interact and navigate in the evironment, good enemy AI but it just isn't fun. its not scary, its not very story heavy and when its there, there isn't enough to make you care. the best thing i can say about it. is it feels like a half life 2 game but one made just to have a fun world. if this is cheap and you like exploring a space station, you might enjoy this. otherwise i hope bethesda just accepts the loss and realize they should have left Prey as a dead IP.

Update: I decided to give the game a good chance and played past 20 hours to near the end. I got the point of having a choice between incapacating the bad guy or stopping him another way. But the game doesn't make it clear that there's a time limit, where to go, how to stop him, or even how to begin. If you just happen to save one specific person they make a suggestion and you're expected to figure out everything else from there.

Additionally around this point in the game enemies respawn constantly, and even on the easiest difficulty the game becomes surprisingly difficult. Im not a big fan of shooters but this becomes a shooter with survival horror level of munitions. These don't mix well to say the least. I went into this part of the game with about 25 medkits and a ton of ammo, and the very first fight took 80% of my supplies then keep up that level of difficulty.... And this was on easy. How can developers allow this? I basically got too annoyed at the game and gave up. I'll be selling this game soon and the only happy thought I'll have about is knowing it is considered a flop because of poor sales",positive

1965,"an ugly, dismal, dreary, nihilistic experience. absolutely none of the rollicking fun of vice city or san andreas, this is more along the lines of gta4 in terms of being absolutely miserable, but without a jolly cousin to take bowling to lighten up your miserable day. every character is miserable except franklin, michael is pointlessly aggressive and often does nonsensical stuff just to advance the plot, and trevor is such an ugly, miserable bully who kills so completely at random in such a way that it becomes disturbing in how disgusting and miserable it is rather than compelling or sickly charming like a Joker or Tony Montana. it's just ugly and disturbing and brings the entire game down. playing the paparazzi missions makes me depressed. playing just one trevor mission makes me want to stop playing the game and just get drunk and think about life.

that sounds like a real stupid reason to hate a game but it's so extreme in tone with the past sort of snarky, wacky ultraviolence of vice city or san andreas that it often feels less like playing a video game and more like a dysfunctional family/suicide simulator.

saints row series goes the direction of over-the-top wacky fun. gta series goes in the complete opposite direction and it's making me miserable like no other video game does. it's painful to try to get through.

in gta san andreas there was an entire series of missions in san andreas where you had to help a bunch of nerds wage a turf war with other nerds using RC airplanes and toy tanks and it's fun and hilarious as hell.

in gta5, one of your main protagonists repeatedly threatens to rape several different people

1967,"I got about six hours into it and found it laborious, but I stuck it out because many games get better as you go and I wanted to give this one a fair shake. I played all the way through and it did improve slightly, but I wish I had spent my time on another game.

There is way too much crafting involved. I don't want to walk around for hours looking for herbs so that I can craft a potion to give someone who might provide me useful Intel later (assuming that I chose the right path for that anyway). And the continuous Googling to make crafting decisions makes the game feel like a science project.

With all games you have to take the bad with the good. But the absolute deal-breaker with this game is the frustration with foot travel. This game should be called ""you can't get there from here."" Slight inclines are too steep to walk up. And you may struggle for 20 minutes to gain access to an area in the middle of the map only to find that an imaginary glass wall prevents further progress -- even when there are no visible obstructions. The game is trying to tell you ""Sorry, you need to spend another 20 minutes and walk around the mountain range to get there."" Traveling on horseback covers more ground and you can survive tremendous falls if you are mounted, but since this game is all about farming you'll miss a lot of crafting items.

On foot, your character must jump to clear tiny obstacles like tree roots. That's not good when you're in combat and the 3rd person camera is buried in a nearby bush. You have no idea why you can't evade the enemy. You just die and hope you come back where you can actually see yourself.

I played the Mass Effect series repeatedly so I love BioWare. And I didn't mind the first Dragon's Age and I like RPGs. But this one is absolutely painful to play.

For those that adore getting immersed in an epic science-fantasy novel, you may tolerate the excruciatingly slow pace. But if you want a game where you feel like you're actually making progress then you should look elsewhere. I suspect that all the favorable reviews were from Dragon Age veterans who knew what to expect.

That's cool that so many people loved this game. And I expect many down votes just because they don't agree with my assessment. I'm just trying to provide a perspective from someone who wasn't already steadfastly loyal to this series.",positive
1968,"I bought this just for the Team Fortress 2 gear. It is a difficult chore of a game. I think that I would rather play poker without the characters let alone with them talking. After a few games I just shut the talking to as little as it could be and that was still too much. There are four characters that you play against, Max the bunny, StrongBad, the Heavy and Tyco. There is no online or multiplayer support. Once I got the Team Fortress unlockables, I was eager to forget this game. It is not the worst poker game out there, but it was a chore to play. Excessive banter between the characters that I didn't care about. It just took so long for them to even play a hand before I adjusted the setting to have them talk less.

I will not buy this game.

I have rated games on Amazon, good or bad in the past, and while it makes you feel good - and it gives the media pundits something to ponder on and write about  - it has little or no influence in the real world (especially on the brass in the targeted companies ) because -  guess what, whiners or not , 99% of those putting ratings out have actually bought the game, and the rating will do very little to dissuade the mass of gamers from buying the game. Yes, we will abuse the game online but we have to buy it to justifiably be able to do it , no? Warhammer II, Assassin's Creed II , Prince of Persia, Empire:Total War - they all got bad Amazon rating due to draconic DRM and still had huge sales.

Few - like me - will have the strength not buy it, much as I've waited for it , realizing this is the only way to attract attention and force the matter on the idiots in charge.

1974,"Looks great & good concept since all you have to do is place the Wii-mote onto the panel. However, those are the only good attributes about this product! Not sure about other 3rd party rechargeable battery setup's (designed for the Wii-exclusively) however, I've got two VERY SERIOUS complaints about this product: 1) If you don't use them for 1 - 1.5-weeks then the battery drains completely!!! In comparison, I won't touch an xBox 360 or a PS3 controller for weeks at a time yet still have a rather decent battery charge on them & 2) Battery life's horrendous on this thing! I'll get lucky if I can get 3 - 4 hours of usage before I need to recharge it again. Fortunately for me, I've got spare double-A batteries at home if these things need to be recharged in the middle of playing. The only reason this product isn't getting a 1-star rating from me is because the charger looks sleek, it actually charges consistently & it was a decent price when I bought it (around twenty-dollars during a Goldbox deal).

1975,"Pros: Cheaper than a gym membership.
Cons: Lots of mediocre content. Poor body tracking. Annoying instructor.

Last year I worked out with a personal trainer twice a week for three months. It was great--I could lift more, jump higher, move faster; my girlfriend complimented me on how muscular I looked (""for a nerd""); and most importantly, I learned a lot about how to work out properly.

""Your Shape"" strives to be a virtual personal trainer, but for all the talk of personalization, it's as impersonal as any gym. For instance, some of the routines instruct you to use dumbbells, but there's no indication of what weight you should be using (5lb? 10lb?). Worse, the comments on your form are rarely accurate. When you're doing push-ups or mountain-climbers, expect a constant barrage of ""Face the same direction as your coach!"" no matter which way you're facing. When you're asked to do tree pose (standing on one foot with the other foot on your ankle), you'll get full credit if both feet are on the ground.

All of this would be fine if there were a way to turn the instructor's verbosity down. Just about everything she says makes my workout experience less pleasant. She sometimes says ""Take 5!"" when what she means is ""The next routine will start in a few seconds."" Does Ubisoft know what ""Take 5"" means? Why do they think I need to hear either ""Good job!"" or ""Keep trying!"" every 10 seconds, when I already have more than enough information for me to know how well I'm doing?

Recently, a software update was released. I'd hoped that it might address some of these issues, but of course it didn't. Instead it just made some DLC available. For a few bucks, you can get... more difficult variations on two of the routines that came with the game. Great.

""Your Shape"" doesn't do itself any favors by including several dance-based routines--""Latin Dance,"" ""Hip-Hop Dance,"" ""African Dance"" and ""Bollywood Dance""--which mostly just remind you that you aren't playing the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Central-2/dp/B0050SYYEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Central 2</a>.

1976,"I had the highest expectations for this game. I remember the first images that were released for Assassin's Creed 1 and thinking that it was going to be one of my favorite games. AC1 came and went, and I was pleased. It was fun, if a little repetitive.

AC3 was a no-brainer for pre-order. I played the spin-offs and enjoyed them enough, but watching the hype machine work itself into a frenzy over this game made me ecstatic. I couldn't wait until release day.

I began the game, and waited for it to start. For five hours I played it, waiting for the game to start. You don't play the main character for about that long. Little did I know that would be the best part of the game, story and mechanics considered.

Once Connor comes onto the scene, I was put through another tutorial. I'm almost double digits of hours into this game and I'm still treated to tutorials. But I soldier through because of the promise that was made. The story missions I try to pay attention to, but I begin to notice that they don't make a cohesive narrative. In order to hit all the main points of the American Revolution, we're treated to a highlight reel of events. This game barrels through Connor's life at breakneck speed. I would have spent more time doing side missions, but they're often served one at a time instead of all at once, This might have been to keep me from feeling overwhelmed, but instead I feel like I'm being led on and don't have any idea of when I'll be finished with the sidequests.

The gameplay is actually fun. If you do a block move and use your item you're treated to some pretty cool death animations. The guards in the city are more number and more obnoxious than I remember. Sometimes I can't tell between the people that I need to be running from and my allies, because it changes over the game.

The spot I pinpoint in the game is a story mission, the Concord/Lexington mission, where you're siding with the colonists, and at one point you are standing side by side with the militia. The militia all have the exact same face, which wouldn't be so bad if their faces were bare and somewhat nondescript, but instead they all have the same goatee and facial hair. It pulled me out of the moment and made me laugh.

Unfortunately, that's the level of quality control that I saw over the entire game. I can't truly say that I would recommend this game to anyone.",neutral

1980,"This game has too many annoying qualities about it. For starters, the way to win is far too easy, just guess the first answer, pass it to the computer, and they are guaranteed to bumble up 3 strikes and you can steal the points with ease. There is no strategy to this game and no competition. Then there is the questioning of some of the games questions that have answers that are ridicules!

The avatar system is yet again something these company's need to start realizing to stop making you play boring tournaments to unlock new clothing and faces... that sort of thing only appeals to 12 year old girls, not people who just wanna quickly make one if the game is going to force you to create one, (A random create would be nice) the rewards you unlock should have been something decent to unlock when you win a game.... not clothing you will never ever bother to use, nor care about.

-Mother-freakin' Rocketeer shout out
-Man vs Alien
-Vertical shooting mechanics that pre-dates Uncharted 3
-Nikola Telsa storyline
-Nolen North as lead
-Fun shooting mechanics and cover system

Past all those things, the game is bad. I ran into so many constant glitches (one was almost game breaking glitchy), that close to the end of the game, I wanted Dark Void to hurry up and be over with. It was a really fun, forgivable, guilty pleasure title...that was until the onslaught of glitches presented itself near the end of the game. Nice idea, just bad execution in flight control and too many system bugs. For these reasons, it's one of the best/worst games I ever played, if that makes any sense.",neutral

1988,"I'm a huge wrestling fan hoping for something to top the n64 wrestling titles and sadly yukes inc have disappointed me yet again! This game is possibly worse than WWE 13. Does it have lots of features, amazing roster, cool new story mode? Yes but at a price. WWE 13 had many features as well and features aren't yukes main problem, playing matches are.

During a match online or off you will experience many awkward-turbo-glitchy-collision-gravity defying-problematic moments! Yukes hasn't improved anything (such a lazy developer how are they still making wwe games????). They just presented things slightly different and called it a day. What were they doing in those special game testing sessions? How did they miss all these blatant technical issues?!! And online is nothing to brag about, trust me.

Next year yukes/2k has an opportunity to make a new wwe game from scratch not some trash thq left behind if it is the same trash as this I officially give up on new wrestling games!!! In short don't buy this!!!

**IMPORTANT** One more thing because this game is riddled with many technical issues it will randomly freeze your PS3 like say you're navigating menus, saving, or it's supposedly loading.

1993,"After seeing 10 reviews and this having a 5 star overall rating (9 five and 1 four), I couldn't resist picking this game up for under 20 bucks.

I'm a 34 year old male who usually enjoys sports simulations, rpg, adventure, and puzzle and family games.

It feels very much like the I Spy games or Hidden Mystery games on the PC. It contains very little story with very short interactions with the suspects.  You do virtually nothing to 'solve' the mystery other than find random items within a picture and solve some simple puzzles.  The items are completely random and don't even go along with the story or setting (ie: within the garden you find a bundle of junk the millionheir left there)

Then to top things off, you suddenly have to perform some silly task before you can get information from a suspect (like fix a clock or find some ingredients for a recipe).  I thought I was supposed to be a detective.

It had a few nice tools, like the usage of a flash light, x-ray pen, and straw (microphone) to blow things around the screen.

Professor Laytons Curious Village was a mystery / puzzle game that was much better than this.  It's puzzles revolved more around logic and reasoning rather than seek and find.  Millionheir feels more like a word search with pictures (I would choose this over a word search) that have little to nothing to do with the plot.

I skipped the rookie mode and chose detective mode (you are given a limited amount of time to find the clues within a picture).  I had at least half the time left for each picture except one.  I never felt rushed to hurry and solve the task at hand even without using the hint button.  Upon completion, you do get more difficult settings if you feel like replaying it again...but I don't have an interest in completing a game just to find different items within the pictures.

Other reviewers call this a 'thinking' game, but I find there are much better 'thinking' games out there (Professor Layton, Flash Focus, Brain Age, most adventure games, most rpg games, and most strategy games).

Based on the reviews, there is definitely a population that enjoys it, so be sure to read their reviews to see if you have similar interests as I seem to be in the minority and not the target audience for this game.

The nice thing about this game is the price relative to most DS games, BUT I would have enjoyed reading 3 new mystery novels for the same price (10+ used mystery novels).",positive

Therefor, for those 2 consoles, I cannot recommend this product.",positive
1997,"Package arrived damaged, disc was floating around.",negative
1998,"Where to begin?  Let me start by saying that ever since we were treated to ET on Atari, with rare exception, movie-based games have generally been pretty awful.  The reason for that is simple, a developer knows that a product's name will entitle it to a certain number of sales just because of the name.  There's no ""extra-incentive"" for you to inflate the budget of a product if you don't expect to recoup that dollar amount in sales.  'Superman Returns', I really thought, wasn't going to fall into that developer trend.

My expectations were raised, oddly enough, when the game was delayed and the demo was released.  'Superman' was originally supposed to come out in May of '06 to coincide with the release of the feature film.  When it was delayed, I mistakenly thought that was the staff at EA saying to itself, ""OK, there's more interest here then we thought, lets sink a little more time and effort into this one.""  The game was subsequently pushed to November to match up with the film's DVD release.  Then the demo for the game hit xBox live and I was legitimately impressed.  Metropolis was huge, the environment was interactive, the flight mechanics were solid; it reminded me of 'Ultimate Spider-Man', just with Superman.  The graphics and the combat system were a little below-average, but I wrote that off as a problem they're working on.  It was just a demo after all, I expected it to be a little rough around the edges.

While nothing that I enjoyed about the game was changed, I'm disappointed to say that none of these issues I had were fixed for the game's final release either.  Not to mention, there's very little to the game outside of the demo I played.  Instead of using the extra time EA took to get 'Superman' released to add content, EA seemed to just seem to multiply what was there already.  Just for example, there isn't enough diversity in the enemies Superman will confront.  You fight Metallo and his minions fairly early in the game.  You'll be fighting those same annoying robots the whole game.  There are only about five or six actual boss fights in the game, none of whom I found particularly difficult.  One of which is the same character twice!  I'd have loved to have seen more of Supe's rogues gallery.

There aren't many side missions you have to distract yourself with either.  It would have been awesome to involve more of Superman's supporting cast to pass along side objectives.  As I said before, there's not more diversity, it's as if they just doubled what was already there.

As far as the previous 'Superman' games go, this is definitely king of the hill.  Some of those games were flat-out awful, this is at least playable.  It's just that I wish they took the nugget of a good thing they had going and fleshed it out a lot more.  For now, it's nothing more then a ""... could of been.""

2002,"In the box you get the headset, detachable microphone, USB / 3.5mm jack cable with the in-line control box, tap cable for the PS3 setup, and an instruction pamphlet.

Setup for the PS3 is pretty involved with you having to use the supplied cable and the A/V cable supplied with the PS3 to tap into its audio out and then plug the 3.5mm jack into the tap and the USB cable into the PS3 USB port for power and audio control. It isn't the most elegant setup but it works. It does have a very long cord so you can be some distance away from the PS3.

Setup for the PC is as simple as plugging in the USB cable and waiting for Windows to detect and setup the headphones.

You plug the headphone themselves into the USB / Control box cable. You are able to disconnect the headphone from this and use them directly plugged into a cell phone. The audio there sounds about as good as you'd expect from a cell. The in-line control box has 6 adjustments on it, chat volume for PS3 / volume for PC, MIC Gain, Game Volume for PS3, bass, MIC on and off, and voice feedback on and off. The voice feedback feature is an uncommon feature. With it turned on your voice is played back in real-time through the headset. It is like talking into a phone. It also gives you a sense of what other people are hearing.

Overall the sound is OK but not great when compared to a Plantronics Gamecom 780 or a Corsair Vengeance 2000. The volume levels your are able to achieve sound low to me. The sound overall sounds flat. You have a bass control but a treble control would have been nice and perhaps helped with the flat sound problem. Without any kind of included software to go with this on the PC the only way I could get these not to sound flat was using music playback software that had an equalizer function. This would help for music played through the app but nothing else.

As far as the look and feel my initial thought as I took these out of the package was that the plastic feels cheap. After further inspection I found the headband has a springy metal band at its core so it does seem like it has some backbone. The ear pads and head pad feel like they are a that fake leathery feeling stuff that tends to degrade over time. The fit was not good. I had to pull the headband adjustment out to its max fully extended position and they just fit onto my ears. I don't have this problem with the other headsets mentioned earlier. I feel like if I had a little more they would feel a bit better but it just isn't there. Also after wearing these for a while they start to bother my ears. They have the fake leather cups that hold heat and moisture in. I had my wife try them and they fit better on her head but she also said that they bothered her ears after just a short time.

Overall these are just OK; there are definitely worse headsets out there. I feel that they might be a better match to a teenager or child but I can't see myself recommending these to anyone over other headsets that I have used.",neutral
2003,"I did not buy the game just played the trial. It has good graphics and is relaxing Match-3 game. You play Match-3 to earn points that translate into money to buy things for restoring the farm. Nice story line. A nice game to play to relax before bed or after school or work but might be boring beyond that. So I think it is overpriced at $10. It should not be more than $6.99 at most, since there is not much replayability and that is one thing i look for in purchasing a game (once you've restored the farm and bought everything what is there to do next but to start over).

You think they would fix alot of things that was wrong with it the first time before rereleasing it on the ps3 instead of just adding new features.  Far as i know they have since i have not played the xbox or pc versions so for all i know it could be a ton better but still kinda bad.

First of all this game is best suited for people who love sniping.  People who hate sniping or aren't very good at it will probably hate this game.  Does this game have it's faults yes many, but the sniping makes up for it(atleast for me).  If you can over look some of its faults you can really enjoy a game like this.  Now for the breakdown...

The good :)

Graphics aren't amazing but pretty good for a modern shooter.  Nothing Battlefield or Cod worth but definitely better looking than Medal of Honor.

Sound is great.  The music during the missions adds to the tension of being shot at while trying to snipe people and not getting noticed.  Also the sound that a silenced sniper rifle makes is just awesome.

Bullet cam.  This is the best part of the game IMO.  You setup your shot, measure wind, monitor your breathing keeping it steady (shooting during exhales increases accuracy for those long shots), guessing when to aim your shots so it won't get interrupted by the rain/wind, measuring bullet drop (the further your enemy is the more likely gravity will pull the bullet down so you need to aim over your target).  For those of you who are lazy Easy and Normal modes of the game come with all that factored in an easy to read red dot.  Point, shoot and then watch your shot travel all the way to your enemy.  Glorious!!!  Another use for the bullet cam would be to scope out the area to see where other enemies would be hiding since your bullet pretty much acts as a really fast disposable camera lol.

The bad :(

The AI is terrible.  Laying down in prone and picking off a battalion of enemies is fun but i was hoping for a challenge.  Why give us claymores and C4 when the enemy doesn't even come to look for you.  When one of their friends gets taken out they run for for 4 feet then just duck.  Yes they just duck.  For casual sniping fans who are playing on easy, normal this is awesome you just keep getting more crazy headshots and more bullet cams but i was expecting better than that.

Glitches galore. Some are good like being able to exploit the poor level/movement design and climb up rocks very cheaply and have great vantage points to snipe from.  Also you can use this same glitch to possibly bypass entire camps by glitching your way up a wall instead of having to carefully snipe/sneak your way through.

Then there is bad glitches, like the trophies glitch.  It's not bad if your not a trophy hound but if you are it is very time consuming to have to redo tasks over and over because the game reads things you haven't done yet as already done and therefore it won't unlock.  There are a number of trophies in the game that won't pop even if you have done it 5+ times.  Example ""One shot, Two Kills"", the shoot 2 enemies with one bullet trophy i've done atleast 10 times before i seen it pop.  Another notorious trophy is the ""Fallen Eagle"" Trophy where you need to shoot 10 eagles out of the sky.  Apparently if you can't unlock this trophy the other trophies in the game won't unlock causing some people to have to delete their saves and play the game over from scratch.  So its advised to get that trophy out of the way during the tutorial.  If it doesn't pop you don't have to go far when you start over.

The movement and level design mechanics are broken and annoying.  If you jump over anything you will end up slipping and getting stuck into crevaces alot!  When your crouched you can't climb stairs.  It is advised to crouch everywhere to avoid being spotted so being crouched when sneaking through an enemy camp is usually what you will be doing alot unless you need to climb something.  So you end up having to stand up and possibly make noise in order to climb stairs and risk being seen.

The rest :/

This is not a COD type game but if you wanted to you can pick up an Assault rifle and go through the game setting off alarms, shooting people and lobbing grenades to your hearts desire like in any COD game.  That sounds awesome to some people but for me i thought the whole point of a game like this was stealth seeing how its called Sniper: GHOST warrior.  But the game doesn't really punish you for setting off alarms so its possible to go through the game clumsy as hell just shooting people left and right with no regard for stealth whatsoever.  Meh...

The main game is pretty easy (even on hard).  As long as your used to setting up your shot, know about bullet drop, leading your bullets for moving targets and everything else involved the game isn't that hard.  It is extremely rewarding to pull off bullet cams without the red dot telling you where to aim and also very frustrating for some of the longer shots in the game.  Thank god a good chunk of the sniper rifles you use are semi-automatic and not single shot or i would have failed some of the time sensitive kill shots. I.e. Sniping a general standing on top of a moving yacht from 350 meters away before he sails off, or trying to hit a sniper in a communications tower from 250 meters away while jets are flying over head masking your shots.

The bonus missions and the challenge mode which is the new features in the game is the hardest part of the game and yet the most glitched.  It is very fun but at some point the glitchiness of the game makes getting those trophies a chore.  In every new level there is a possible glitch that will make you not get the trophy for that level, so you will end up having to delete your save and try again.

Much like the rest of the game the multiplayer is not great but pretty fun.  A big map with a ton of campers usually would suck for people who love action but there is also the choice of running around and gunning people down with your handgun.  I found the most fun playing on the tower map where you have to snipe people in other towers while trying not to get sniped yourself.

Far as i can see the game is imperfect that is probably why it was released for $40.  But it is definitely fun, if you into a somewhat realistic sniper shooter with long distance cinematic head/body shots.  If you like that sort of thing then i say give this game a try.

2009,"The cord stopped functioning properly and if you want a replacement cord it's the same cost as a whole new kit!
I just purchased a similar cord that was braided, costed less, and was longer and have had no problems.

Buy your own rechargeable batteries and do it that way. Maybe I'm the 1% who has issues but the cord lasted for 3 months. Too long for a return here at amazon and not long enough for a real life span.

I debated between 2 and 3 stars because while I have some negative comments, I also have positive, and 2 seemed unfair. So-deep breath-here weeee go!

GOOD
-Graphics(wow! Especially when you're going down the steps into the tombs.)
-Voice acting(going for the gold! Characters sound so alive, and not like machinery or anything.)
-Conversation pace(I used to get so bored with the talking, but characters speak...faster. It's as though they know I have a short attention span!)
-Character Animation(They look so real. Nothing like the cartoons from Secrets Can Kill. A few of them creeped me out, because I felt like I was talking to a real person.)

BAD
-Only three places to explore(And this is REALLY bad. What's the fun in that?)
-Too many Slider puzzles I didn't care about
-Can't dial random numbers on your phone.
-Some characters, Hotchkiss especially, annoy me.
-Game was rather short.
-Hard to care about anyone, as none of the characters is likable. An yeah, I really mean it.
-I just...didn't really care about solving the mystery. Egyptian curse mystery is a little corny.

I haven't beaten it yet as I've only been able to play it while a friend of mine has doctor appointments, but I feel like I have a very good sense of the game and where it's going. I also haven't played the original Resistance games for PS3 or the one for PSP though I do own them. I would say for the right price, this is a fun title to have for your PSVita.

Why only three stars then? Mostly technical stuff that I can't look past. I'll still play the game, but it's a bit away from a better rating.

First of all, the gameplay - totally linear. Game leads you down a path, you shoot some bad guys, maybe have a boss. It's also done in a weird campaign/not-a-campaign style? I'm not wildly familiar with a campaign element in a game, the closest I've had is with Left 4 Dead where each campaign was playable separately and you could attack any of them in whatever sequence you preferred. This one is brought about in these vignettes where part of the story will close and you'll be treated to a short cutscene where a politician or a news anchor will tell you the situation in the city, how Chimera are everywhere and forces have been employed to combat it, that humans will prevail, etc. Then it cuts you back in the game. Here's a weird thing though - I watched through a cutscene, and then an in-game cinematic leading up to the next part of the game and then I turned my game off. A couple days later, I load the game back up, and I have to sit through the whole pre-rendered cutscene and the in-game cinematic I already watched, totaling I'd like to say about 8 minutes of wasted time I could've spent picking up where I left off. I didn't even get to the next cutscene, but I got pretty far and had to turn my system off again. When I loaded my save that time, I ONCE AGAIN had to watch that pre-rendered cutscene but thankfully after was transported to the part of the game I left off at. I have a feeling anytime there's a cutscene with somebody explaining the situation, it's most likely just a cover-up for the game trying to load its assets and levels, making it seem like you're instantly able to play when in reality you're not. I honestly don't care, I would stare at a progress bar rather than have to watch these same clips over and over anytime I load the game. It makes it feel like before every cutscene, you're being readied for the next ""campaign"", and with how the game tries to tell its story, the whole campaign system seems a little bit out of its element here.

About the linear qualities of the game I was talking about earlier, that was more so just a warning and not necessarily anything that works against it. A lot of Vita ""Versions"" of major console games I've played have been the same story, the biggest example coming to mind is Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate. It's not a bad game, but it definitely sets you in one direction (Though Batman does let you choose in which order). And even that is fun. It reminds me a little bit of rail shooters like House of the Dead, the major difference in this being you do have some free range of your environments where in those games the camera just moves you along into the next room where you have to shoot people. The weapons are fun as well and their little bonuses are great, but the specialty ammo that makes the guns unique and fun is kind of hard to come by. Not to mention that a lot of the secondary functions of your rifles involve interactions with your touch screen, and every so often I'd find myself accidentally brushing against the screen with my thumb and almost sending out a grenade (A few times actually wasting special ammo like that). I gotta give them credit for trying to take advantage of the Vita's touch screen, but it doesn't really give any positive boosts to the game.

The story is interesting though. The actual game look is pretty good. Instructions are a little laxed - I found myself with only a vague idea how to fight at a boss battle only to figure it out and afterwards look it up online to see several people who had the same frustration. The game didn't really communicate well how to take out some of the enemies, but that's fine. Still not really a deal breaker as it was only temporarily frustrating. (If it helps, I've also been playing it on Normal mode, out of the three difficulties of Casual, Normal, and Expert. Those may not be the exact wording in the game for them, but you get what I mean. The game is probably much easier on Casual.) As far as instructions, anytime you pick up a new weapon it plays a small video showing exactly how its special attack works, and that was really helpful.

Another control critique is that there is a ""sprint"" button to get out of hot situations, but it's for some reason the Down button on the D-Pad? I could understand at least making it the Up button, but it feels very bizarre having it default to being the down button. I haven't really checked to see if there's anyway to change that, and for all I know the Up button might do something in the game later that makes perfect sense - I certainly haven't been using it for much else so far.

Those cutscenes, though - they just pull you out of it. And for some reason, they also look TERRIBLE. Like, it's not like they had a bad art department or anything, it still looks reasonable for the time being, the art looks fine, the animations that play are also good for what they need to convey - but the actual video quality of the cutscenes is ridiculously bad. On some of the scenes I watched, color lines and warping will happen at the top and bottom of the screen. If it's supposed to do that for added effect, it certainly doesn't look like it is, and it doesn't make much sense either way. The color lines and warping make the scenes look almost like they were converted digitally from VHS. There's no other way to describe it, and that makes no sense because this all seems to be happening in 1951. If anything, the scenes should be jumping and skipping, slowing down here and there to imitate a faulty reel projector. Not to mention that these scenes are heavily compressed to where scene of solid color stand out to be artifacted bricks blocking their way in around the illustrations of the scene. Each of those scenes (Before it heads into an in-game cinematic) can't be much more than four minutes. Would encoding these files which are mostly animation in a codec that could've at least been 720p HD without much artifacts present really take up all that much space? I can't imagine it being more than a few MBs.

From what I've played, for an under $20 title, it's a good buy. Would I have payed the full $40 or whatever the original retail price of it was? Hell no. But it's a fun, arcade-y kind of first person shooter and it deserves some love. You should definitely have it in your Vita collection, but don't expect it to be a new favorite. In fact, you might want to buy another game with it just to soften the blow.",positive

This one on the other hand shows while they changed things in the menu and setup did not operate as smoothly as prior games and I usually tinker with it for a while then shut if off as it just has to many things going on before you can fly anything.

2017,"If Fatal Frame proves anything, it's that it's not hard to make a scary game, it's only hard to make
a quality scary game. In a previous review I gave this game, I said the game was very scary but
probably not as scary as people were saying.  I might have judged this game too early. I guess it
happens when you judge games before beating them or at least getting half ways.
I finally realized that this isn't an ordinary survival horror game.  The developers of Fatal Frame
clearly wanted to make the scariest game ever regardless of how good the game was in general.
The game is horror from the time you insert the disc to the time you finish.  The games characters
aren't good, the storyline isn't good, Tecmo didn't care about good they just wanted scary.  Some
of the ghosts are disturbing, one ghost that stood out was a female child ghost with a burned face.
If some of the rituals and believes in this game, freak you out, it's probably because they aren't
made up.  The rituals in this game are said to be based on a true story.  This game however
received a TEEN rating, which is simply incorrect.
I think this is indeed the scariest game of all time.  The game is able to blend a formula
combining the powers of both Resident Evil and Silent Hill.  Some of the images are as
disturbing as those in the original Silent Hill.  The game creates the kind of tension off jump
scares that only Resident Evil does.  Both Silent Hill and Resident Evil are better games than
Fatal Frame, but when a game combines the formula of those two and lives only to scare you and
not to sell copies, you have the scariest game of all time.
What does this mean to Resident Evil and Silent Hill?  Well, to Resident Evil, I don't think it
means anything.  Resident Evil will continue doing what it does to sell millions.  Konami
promises that they've gone back to the roots of the original Silent Hill and are no longer
concerned with toning down their material.  As far as Fatal Frame, I haven't heard of any plans
for a sequel.  Fatal Frame didn't sell particularly well, but I think their only focus was horror not
success or quality.",neutral
2018,"Overall it was not a great game.  I am glad I played it, the combat system which I at first did not like grew on me.  I found it very linear which is not a problem for me.  I avoided most of the side quests so I could just finish the game.  So it filled a void where I did not have a RPG to play, so it gets 3 stars from me.",negative
2019,"Overall this mouse is just okay, after using it for a year and a half. I have medium sized hands and use a claw grip and it isn't the most comfortable mouse in the world. I find it really hard to find a good grip on it and most of the time my pinky is left dragging on the mouse pad. The sniper button is very very stiff and located way to far forward. It becomes useless for any in game macro that you would need fast access to and due to the force required to press, moves the mouse to the side. The cord is on the left side and is quite heavy and naturally the mouse wants to cock to the left.

Now for the pros: The mouse is very nicely weighted and is extremely sturdy and well made as with most corsair products. The aluminum frame is sexy and the rubberized coating on top and textured sides feel really nice on the hand. The scroll wheel is solid and satisfying to use and so are the left, right, forward, and back buttons. The software is deep and easy to use, though macros can be confusing to program at first. There are settings for lift height, and surface quality, and I really can't complain about stability as it's never bugged or crashed.

If you use a palm grip and have larger hands, this may be a great mouse for you, though for someone with medium or small hands, I don't recommend it. I would look at other models to suit you.",positive
2020,"The first game was smart, sleek, a little graphically ugly, and deep. There was enough gameplay to keep you hooked for days upon days... and then you have to learn how to use everything! Leveling up was difficult before, but now it is cleaner and more compact. Shooting is more clear with the Gears of War style. Your health regenerates (Blegh) and your ammo depletes (Double Blegh) but I will dismiss that. I just wish that combat was not the focus.

This has so much more to it than the combat though. EA did a good job with this game, intergrating elements from the first games choices into this one. Things you did in the first game effect the entire world for the next game. Even your character's look transfers over!

There are several things about this game warranting a purchase. It is an M rated game and you should be careful before buying it for your kid, there are romantic scenes that are sensored. It is deeper than Gears of War, but not as much as the first. Get it if you can handle it.",positive
2021,"Okage: The Shadow King (Called ""Me and the Demon King"" in Japan) is a  decidedly mixed bag of a video game experience that essentially delivers an especially memorable character in the Evil Shadow King Stan, who delivers some of the most definitely humorously droll dialogue seen in a video game for awhile, but inevitably falters in delivering an exceedingly entertaining Nightmare Before Christmas-segue video game experience. By neglecting to improve the game's battle engine, abundantly retaining its childishly obnoxious visuals, focusing to heavily on it's grievously clichd uninteresting RPG (Role-Playing-Game) stereotyped characters, focusing on a moronically simple game-play, heinously allowing exasperatingly redundant enemy encounters, and ultimately shying away from it's central appeal of comedy a third way into the experience restricts this exceptionally quirky title from living up to it's possible potential.

2022,"The problems with this game are the reasons I ""got off of"" superhero games a couple of years ago.
So, first the bad:
-  Similar to other past superhero games, each level/checkpoint looks exactly like the one you just left...with some minor changes.
-  Also, the enemies came at me in waves so familiar I could feel a spider web shooter slowly forming on my ring-hand wrist.
-  I always seem to be destracted by how the camera angle is not adjusted during play with the right stick.  The default angle serves you pretty well undr most conditions but I kept hitting the right stick late into the game expecting to move the camera.
-  I can't wait until technology finally catches up with the potential for superhero games.  I'm burnt out on the small character in the middle of the screen with limited powers and no ability to fly at will.

The Good:
-  The did a good job with the ring weapons.  There are enough I didn't get tired of them through the whole game.  And, you can't over-use any single one since your enemies will demand certain attacks.
-  The two player set-up is good, you're able to join in at any time.  I do not beleive the 2nd player can earn achievments.  But, that second person comes in handy for sure, especially if you don't play on the easiest level.

Lastly,
Come on video game makers! We need a new mindset or something when it comes to these classic superhero's being brought to life in games.  I'm guessing the desire to release these games in conjunction with the movie release is causing some re-hashing of old tricks with a slightly new look.  I can no longer fool myself into believing that this all-powerful, classic superhero's powers are limited to a 10' circle around him, and I can no longer believe that his power of flight is now reduced to a series of dashes and jukes.",neutral
2023,"I got the game based on the pc reviews. I bought the ps4 version the day it came in the mail all the reviews were coming out talking about how bad it is and how bad the framerate is. I thought about returning it but thought what the heck ill give it a go it cant be that bad.

And its not that bad at all. I don't notice the framerate being as bad as some have said. I have had 2 instances of framerate dropping but other than that its run pretty smooth. The motion blur is annoying ive gotten used to it at this point. Everytime you get to a checkpoint the game freezes for a second or two. Its happened to me in games before noticably skyrim and fallout. The story is interesting i haven't beaten it but i fully intend to as ive had alot of fun playing it. The spell casting and being able to make your own spells is really fun. Usually i don't play mage classes in rpgs as i find them limited and confined to the mana bar and potions. None of that here just cast to your hearts content. Makes you feel like a bada$$ caster.

This game does have issues i will admit that the graphics are hit and miss. Snow is laughably bad. If they patch it it will be a good time waster. As i said earlier im having fun with it and after logging off for the night i couldn't wait to get back to it and thats kinda what counts right having fun.

2025,"I did have greater expectations for it, hence the 3 star rating.  Yes, I do think Sony had dropped the ball a little bit and for some problems I am given the impression that the device was rushed out.  Before you get alarmed however hopefully my gripes are clear in what I hope is a constructive review below.

Things I like about this:

- It streams from your PS4/PS4 remote play.

- Access to various Vita and classic games.

- It's a Vita (sort of) but for your TV.

Things I don't like about this:

- There is too much lag in the PS4 remote play streaming, even for a wired connection with a 2ms ping.  You can see the problem just in navigating the frontend UI.

- The UI.  It's the Vita UI and this aspect isn't unreasonable, however there has been a very minimal effort to tailor it to an experience on the PlayStationTV.  Some aspects of it are just plain unintuitive and don't translate very well to a world that doesn't have a touchscreen.

- The music in the UI.  Sounds like something I'd expect from the Wii or Wii U.  I mean it really is awful.

- No media streaming directly from your network directories.  You are required to install software to handle this, which means you are SOL if you're using any more exotic than normal hardware or OS (Linux or a NAS for example).  Sony has better supported this in previous hardware - PS3 and bluray players for example.  This is a downgrade from that.

- I can download (and buy) games/apps that are clearly incompatible with it.  If I can buy or download it, then I think it is reasonable for me to think it might work on the device I am downloading or buying it on, but in some cases this is not true, even partially.  Netflix app is the most discussed public example.
- The emulation of the touch screen is a joke.  Try playing Jetpack Joyride which underlines this and puts the game into the category of 'this shouldn't be available for download on the PlayStationTV'.
- The fact that the memory card required is Vita specific and these are badly priced as far a $/GB goes.  Actually Sony, this is a rip off and a terrible aspect of the Vita ecosystem.  As part of the PlayStation ecosystem I would expect the same treatment as other PlayStation devices, which means supporting non-proprietary media.  Come on Sony...do something with the USB hub...please.

- No Netflix app right now (or any similar service), which is kind of a must have for the launch of any such device.  Possibly not ever a Netflix app for the TV (given what Netflix currently has to say about it)  (and for the record, the Vita Netflix app doesn't work and using the PS4 one via streaming - yes, a daft thing to do anyway but people will seek desperate alternatives right now - is blocked).

Things that might put you off, but IMHO are implemented reasonably (so they also have my suggestion/mitigation):

- Wifi PS4 streaming has way too much lag.  Mitigation : You really shouldn't be buying this for PS4 remote play if you were going to insist on using Wifi.  Unfortunately Sony does support Wifi streaming with a recommendation that you have a 'robust Wifi' (whatever that means).  If they support it, then all these 1 or 2 star reviews complaining about something that is supported but doesn't work well are fair game IMHO but my recommendation is obviously to consider this unsupported.  Incidentally, I tried both PS4 and TV on Wifi and one on Wifi/one Wired and neither were acceptable.  The latter at best was about 50/50 good vs choppy (stutter, lag and pixelation from over compression).

- No surround audio.  Not unreasonable given the Vita is just a stereo device (why would the TV be any different), however it's competing in a range of micro-consoles and streaming devices that do have this.  You'll really notice a difference when playing your PS4 games.  Suggestion : Ugh, but maybe it's best to set your expectations in line with this OR consider passing on the PlayStationTV.

- PS4 remote play, using a PS3 controller doesn't cover the whole functionality of the PS4 controller features...obviously.  Mitigation : If you want to use this for PS4 remote you really should get a PS4 controller for it, the cost of which should be thrown into your purchase the bundle or base decision.  Don't buy this with the idea of using something less in mind.

I do think this is well priced, however there is a value proposition that comes into play too and it depends on what you want to use it for and the extra things you might have to buy.  I bought this as a PS4 extender for which it does an okay job.  $99 is not an awful lot of money to spend to get this and while I think that experience could be much better, the benefit of this + the benefit of access to a few more games, trades off for a reasonable buy.

However, an actual Vita might be a better purchase.  Look at the math (official price rounded up to nearest $):

- Vita bundle (top game + minimum necessary memory card + vita) = $200

- Base PlayStation TV ($100) + minimum necessary memory card ($30) + controller (PS3 $55/PS4 $60) = $185 vs $190

- Bundle option of PlayStationTV, PS3 controller, minimum necessary memory card and a good (but not great) game = $140

- Bundle option of PlayStationTV, PS3 controller, minimum necessary memory card and a good (but not great) game ($140) AND a PS4 controller ($60) = $200

- Buying the components of the bundle separately - PlayStationTV ($100), memory card ($30), PS3 controller ($55), the bundled Lego game (currently $20) = $205

The bundle IS good value then, however not if:

- You are buying it for PS4 streaming, in which case you really want to (or should) add a PS4 controller (or you'll have to put up with some incompatibilities).  You're looking at either bundle + PS4 controller ($200) or base and all that entails + PS4 controller ($190).

- You already have the game, even if it is on another system.

- You may get more value out of spending an extra $10 or $15 and having the same/better functionality out of getting an actual Vita.

- You are considering downloading more than 2-4 fulls games, which according to Sony is the expected capacity of the packaged or minimum necessary memory card.  Yep, that's right...if you're downloading more games you better expect to pay more for a second or replacement memory card.

And as an aside, I think a bundle purchase intended for PS4 streaming use might be an acceptable buy when considering the PS3 controller as something for player 2.  Player 2 being on a PS3 controller is going to work for many cases.

People should seriously consider the option of buying a Vita as an alternative however.  The Vita is obviously more compatible with the Vita apps than the PlayStationTV is and it more or less supports all the same features, does so arguably better AND is more portable (which includes the remote play options...the Vita does this over your local network AND the internet).  The downside of the Vita handheld however is that:

- The current version no longer has a HDMI out, so it won't hook up to your TV.

- It's purely a handheld experience then.

- No good for two player experiences either.

For my use, I think the PlayStation TV is well priced, but the value proposition could be a little better.  I am somewhere between vaguely and strongly disappointed in several aspects of it depending on what feature you are looking at but despite that I am keeping mine because of the price for PS4 extending and remote play.  I would absolutely reconsider had I have intended downloading more full price Vita games and being forced into spending ridiculous sums on larger capacity memory cards and I have to admit I am vaguely tempted to just take it back and get a Vita anyway.

Update:

Eeek...two days into it and just by downloading half a dozen small games, the memory card is full.  What was I saying about that now?",positive

2027,"I got this game because I didn't want to spend the money to buy Guitar Hero when I'd never played it before...that's a lot of money! A friend recommended this and I decided we'd try it.

The minute I put it in the Wii, I was extremely disappointed. It didn't seem fun at all! I put it away after only a few moments and promptly forgot about it. My seven year old son, however, begged me to play it the next day, and I said yes.

As I watched him hitting the notes, my competitive edge got the better of me, and I grabbed a wiimote and went at it with him. He chose a song when I wasn't looking, and I was shocked to hear the chords of one of my favorites, Feel Good Inc. come over the speakers! He got ahead of me and suddenly I was listening to it from a mariachi band...not a good mix.

The fun of this game is for the competitive people as well as for those who love to hear their music a number of different ways. Unlike other games, this one takes the song and twists it into ways you've never imagined. Want to hear Feel Good, Inc. as a country song? No problem! Prefer to listen to That's The Way I Like It through the unique stylings of an undead mariachi band? Sure! (""that's the way, uh huh uh huh, mi gusta, uh huh uh huh"")

Is this a game we'll be playing for months? Probably not. But it is a great way to get a seven year old, a four year old, and two adults playing together. One of the best parts about the game is that I can set my level to hard while going against my 4 year old, who is set on easy, giving her a fair shot at kicking my behind (which then finds me nursing my wounded ego, let me tell you...)",positive
2028,"Well, the game itself is just great...  a few years out of date by now, but for flight sims, that's OK.  It's a lot of fun, and allows you to fly some terrific pseudo-historical missions set in the WWII era.  Visually, it's very nice, though I wish it had full head-tracker support (which is pretty much crucial for prop-era non-radar-equipped aircraft without AWACS/etc.

There's a problem with this game, though...  and if you run modern hardware, you'll very likely encounter it.  The problem is a so-called ""copy protection"" scheme which is bundled with the game called ""Safedisk.""  Safedisk encrypts the actual game executable (in an ""ICD"" file) and when you run the apparent game-executable, it merely decrypts the REAL executable and runs it.

In concept, not that bad of an idea.  In execution, a HORRIBLE one.  Because, for example, if you have a CD burner or the equivalent, and the Safedisk tools identify that, it will simply refuse to decrypt the file, and you will ""crash to desktop.""  It's not a problem with the program itself, it's a problem with the supposed ""copy protection"" technique.

If you want to run in a compatibility mode... well, that would work just fine with the ACTUAL executable, but not in this case.  You'll be putting the ""decrypter"" into compatibility mode, not the actual game executable.  And the decrypter will fail if you put it into a compatibility mode, most of the time.  Plus, of course, you're prevented from making settings which apply to the game executable which might allow it to run properly (through setting compatibility settings).

SO...  If you're willing to gamble with getting this running, I recommend it.  But if you're not technically savy, and don't have a LOT of patience... and if you expect what you buy to just work out of the box...  don't bother.  The odds are not in your favor.",negative
2029,This isn't too bad overall for the price but could be a little less repetitious meaning they could have added a bit more to the games to give them a bit more longevity.

I only played this through once because doing it again just seemed overwhelming; too much of a time commitment.  Additionally, the game is serious, something GTA was never really known for.  The missions and activities weren't really fun, they were just tasks to be done.

Once I started to get a good feel for the pace and the structure of the game though, I felt the developer was trying to stretch a decent, medicore action game a little too thin. The ""plot"" is a joke as is the dialogue. The swinging is fun, but restricted and the shooting and weapons are very disappointing. One of the game's highlights is the ""Challenge"" system that constantly feeds you gameplay requirements to complete. Most of them come with an in-game bonus along with a majority of them being tied directly to the Achievement system. In one playthrough, I had 90% of them complete, but the remaining few weren't enough to make me want to play through the game a second time.",positive
2033,"First off, let me say I was really pulling for this game.  Despite the bugs that the original had, I have a solidly entertaining run through, both times I played it from start to finish.  I was really looking foward to picking up my old character and making a new run through the NWN universe.

That hope quickly died as I started my first run through.  I opted to create a new character, as I was anxious to take the new genasi out for a spin.  A few min later my fighter/duelist walked out onto the scene.  Over the next few hours I found my anger and frustration growing.  First to rear it's head was AI issues, which had supposedly been worked on.  My wizard buddy still loves to both overspell, and cast spell types inappropriate for the situation (ex, spell resistance in a fight with all melee types).

I also seem to be having some issues with the scaling of combat.  Now, it's possible that it's because I made a new character (18) instead of importing my old one (20).  I'm starting over with the import, but even so, the fights seem incredibly difficult in places.  This almost makes the game unplayable.

So, I am going 3 stars because it's a blend of a 5 star plot (so far), and a 1 star implimentation.",positive
2034,"As of the time of this review, chat functionality on the PS4 is not COMPLETELY wireless.  In its current state, the headset will not connect to the PS4 via Bluetooth thus forcing you to use the 2.5mm to 3.5mm jack adapter that plugs into your controller.  While it works, it's still not wireless.

Setup is somewhat cumbersome in that I needed to get ANOTHER fiber optic cable to hook into the wireless adapter (sorry, the supplied cable is thinner than angel hair and doesn't warrant a ""why not"" from me) which acts as a pass-through for your home receiver in addition to feeding your headset the sound it needs for Dolby Digital Surround production.

And how is that production?  Well, I have mixed feelings on that front.  For $149, even with all of its ""wireless"" trappings, I would still expect bass reproduction to be on par with a $100 pair of headphones at least.  It's not.  It wasn't with the PX3s either and the Turtle Beach moniker has long worn out its welcome; the prestige that they once held in PC sound boards from long ago has left them quite some time ago.  My Afterglow's actually sound better than this set.  Chat is serviceable, but I wish that the game audio was better and had more punch.

The microphone does have a welcome feature of being removable should you choose to use it strictly for listening to game audio and not disturbing the entire household.

Another welcome and surprising feature was its ability to pair to 2 Bluetooth devices:  1) for the wireless sound transmitter and 2) for a phone.  Now you can actually answer a phone call while you're gaming and not miss a call as a result.  This is also welcome should you decided that you have a need to call a friend to see if they're having connectivity issues for a multiplayer session, etc.

However, it's still missing quite a bit for me to say that it's worth a buy.  The wireless aspect from a PS4 standpoint is not completely on Turtle Beach's end, but my take on this is that you shouldn't release a product until it's truly ready for what it's intended for.  Also, the audio setup for the wireless connector is simply annoying and the supplied optical cable is laughable - I'm afraid that this thing is going to snap like a twig if I inadvertently grab it the wrong way.  Sound reproduction from a directionality standpoint is decent, but I want to FEEL explosions in Battlefield 4, not merely acknowledge that something happened on mid/high frequencies.

The first few levels are great but once you hit the 4th mission it just gets boring. I loved borderlands but this is nothing like it other than the stupid conversations and the comic book look. I would give this game 2 stars but since I enjoyed half the game I'll give it three.. Only 8 missions in the game as well so that's pretty crappy but if there were anymore I'd probably shoot myself. It only takes a day to beat the 8 missions so I guess you better like multiplayer if you're going to buy this. (Which I don't),positive
2039,I was so excited when I got home to play this game and it turn out to be terrible. I still didn't play the single player campaign story but the multiplayer online was pretty bad. The graphics suck and the connection was terrible. The maps weren't that large than MW2's maps. This game was shocking to me. I say that battlefield is better than this game.,positive
2040,"Whoever did the programming and game engine for Final Fantasy XII deserves praise.  It's slick, it's fast, it's immersive and it's good fun - battles are more challenging than they've been since around Final Fantasy IV and V, and the whole system is clearly well thought through.  Perhaps it's more reminiscent of Baldur's Gate and Summoner than of Final Fantasy; and that does leave it feeling unlike Final Fantasy at times.  But all the same, it's very slick and well made.

The trouble is the characters.

Try as I might, I can't care about them.  I don't like them.  Only Balthier of the main party is remotely interesting.  The villain, too, lacks any presence; there's no real Adversary here.  Oh, you know who he is, and who you're going to be up against; but there's no conflict.  You're fighting an Empire, and he's part of it, but there's no PERSONAL adversary, like Cloud versus Sephiroth, Seifer versus Squall, or Tidus and his old man.  Or diverting to a less well-made but better written game, the challenge between title character and deceptive demon in Summoner.  The enemy in this game is more complex in terms of motive; but because the game doesn't have the space to really explore it in depth and develop a real DARKNESS to him, you end up with an opponent who tends to seem washed-out and weak more than he feels sophisticated.

You just can't stand him up against the other Final Fantasy villains, and not think that he's a pale shadow of them.

It simply takes too much time waiting to build to a real conflict.  The story may be good - albeit badly told at times - but that's not enough without strong characters to pull it together.  A good story with weak characters is worse than a weak story filled with genuinely interesting people.

Like other people have said; side-quests are most of the fun of this game.  That's where the game engine can come into its own, and you can ignore the story altogether.  And unlike other Final Fantasy games, you feel no pull from it; no drive to continue.  If it was a book, you'd have stopped reading.  And that's a sad thing, because for me, the story was why I played Final Fantasy in the first place.",negative
2041,"I'm not a huge RPG fan, I got the game just to take a break from COD,Battlefield, and KZ. To be honest, the first 5-6 hours of the game was fun, but after that it gets reallllyyyy boring and repetitive. There is no combo like God Of War, there is no detailed character customization ( just a simple face & hair ), the game is not open world as you might think specially toward the end in the Ice mountains which you basically run in a linear pathway.

There is crafting and leveling in the game and by the end of the game I was around lvl 27. Therefore, I don't know what the lvl cap is.
Graphics are just right. Nothing eye candy nor something ugly. Music & sounds are perfect. Lip sync is terrible, and so as the voice acting are very fake.
I finished the game in 7 hours by simply doing the missions and no side mission, and loot whatever was around me. However, I got to say the game is hard even on easy setting. You get attacked by archers from one side, and the crazy looking monster from another, and at the same time 2 more skeletons show up. You end up fighting like 5 enemies at the same time, but all you go to do is attack then block immediately after. Repeat this all the way to the end of the game, and throw some flames around just to keep things less boring.
  I recommend this game if you have nothing to play & have lots of patience. Get the game when it's cheaper around 35$",negative
2042,Great game brought back memories of old school ssx. Only wish it had co op/offline multiplayer,positive
2043,"Destiny is like a bag of chips, it tastes good but it's bad for you. Destiny is fun, but I was really let down on a good portion of this game.

Cons:
- Story, what is it exactly? Who are these guys, why am I killing them? All you get is, ""the story is too long to tell, so here you go into the world..."". It seems as if it's made for dlc to expand it as there's no climax, ending, what so ever, the plot is just so lacking. This is due I guess to the writer changes at Bungie so they had to scrap everything. Overall, I expected better from Bungie as I know they can write better stories.

- Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive... did I get your attention on repetitive it is? Missions, start at the same point on every planet, while going through maybe a part of the previous level you already ran through and then kill the same 3-4 enemies you've already killed hundreds of times, in later levels you just sprint through the whole level because enemies they don't give enough exp. Once at the end of the level, upload your ghost, and then fight waves of enemies til your ghost finishes while not helping, over and over again. Same goes for Strikes, w/out bounties, it's the same Strike boss over and over, w/ bounty, it goes up to about 3.

- Endgame: Bungie, ""The game will totally change after lvl20!"". Yea sure... except waay more monotonous grinding for the 5% chance you're gonna get a rare/legendary loot item to lvl up, oh boy! Sub-lvl 20 is a more fun than after lvl 20. Post-lvl 20 you'll want to start farming chests and other farm runs, so you'll see 20 plus lvl people running a chest farming circuit as chests will randomly spawn in certain spots so you'll see people going room to room looking for chests as it's the fastest way to get gear.

- Loot system: Where's the loot? Uncommon (although not very common) until about lvl10 won't be better than what you have, rare/legendary almost never drops, aaand sometimes aren't even better than what you have. Rare/legendary items are what they are, they should Always be better than what you have.

- Game is EMPTY. Most amount of people you'll see is in the main hub which is about 10, in level, I've seen 4 max, sometimes game is completely empty. The other problem is NOBODY joins your party, the game is lot more fun when you play w/ others but no one joins you! In the entirety of playing this game I had like a total of 3 people play w/ me.

- Public Events: Disappointing, I distinctly remember the E3 gameplay where 5-10 players joined up, NEVER happened to me! I'm claiming false advertising against Bungie. Nothing like this, I had 1, ONE person join me, Max on PE's. They're also pretty repetitive and not that fun.

- Constant disappearing of waypoint marker, you constantly need to hit the thumbstick to bring up the waypoint marker, why doesn't it just stay active?

- No party match for daily/weekly Strike, it says xbox live gold required like the other Strike missions so you'd assume you'd be partying up, but nope.

Pros:
- Backdrops, planets, all look incredible, seeing auroras, satellites, and a giant moon hanging over the hub just look great and you think you're on (or wish) another planet. Planets are very well designed, each planet looks like it should, great visuals, and it's a joy to be on the planets.

- Music: Again very well done, gets you pumped up before a battle, and just good background music.

- Graphics, for the 360, this game has pretty great graphics, especially for a game this size, looks better than much smaller games I've played and just as good or better than other big 360 games. Graphics should not be looked down upon if choosing a version to play.

- Menu!: Menu! LOVE the ""mouse"" free moving type of cursor instead of menu button choosing, if done right the cursor can be really nice w/ a thumbstick and it was refreshing to use, also gave the game an identity of being a more modern type of game. Wish more games had menus like this.

- Shooting/rpg aspects really well done, loved seeing the numbers pop off enemies as you shoot them, lvl'ing up upgrades well done, seeing the exp. bar at the bottom, all felt rewarding.

- Strikes: As they're the ONLY mission where you're forced to play w/ others.

Overall:
Sure the game is fun, but the repetitiveness, non-existent story, and emptiness just kills this game. I was disappointed, I was also falsely advertised to. I would recommend this game if you're looking for something to play, overall it's just not a good game, it's overhyped, disappointing, and it's just not a game that especially Bungie fans like myself expected. I would also recommend playing until lvl 20 and then quitting, there's nothing post-lvl 20 that's worth it, unless you don't mind monotonous grinding, Really want to get through Vault of Glass, and get that final achievement. Also, STOP, STOP, comparing this game to Halo, game is NOTHING like Halo, don't believe anything you read comparing this game to Halo, it does barely compare to Boderlands though.",neutral

2050,"Some of the Tales of...titles seem to generate comparisons to the Star Ocean series. While the two are completely different games, I, too, began to see similarities...and then the similarities grew as I progressed through this title.

Graphics

Cell shaded. The locales are quite nice, but some of them do appear rather flat and stale at times. The graphics during battle run very smoothly and are quite nice. The detail of the characters and monsters are quite nice.

Gameplay

You will love the combat engine. There are a few mini games scattered throughout the game that are quite easy to pick up and play. Also, navigation isn't too difficult; though, being on foot for almost the entire game on the world map can become quite tedious. The game has a short learning curve. You can easily compare it to Star Ocean.

Story

When is picks up, it gets good; however, when it slows down, its really slow. Even some of the main missions seem out of place as at times they do very little as regards to progression in the story. At times, the story does drag...The story, for the most part is solid, but not all that original. The story itself is somewhat predictable.

Characters

Entertaining, but not a bunch I would opt to travel around the world with. Some character's personalities are a little dry while some of the others are just plain annoying. Some of the characters are almost one-dimensional as there isn't much to their personality--story wise, there really is only one character who goes through a massive change.

Overall

There are some sidequests...and they take you way out of your way to complete them. It would have been one thing if your character had a faster means of transportation across the world map. With the amount of random encounters, its bound to annoy anyone who just wants to get the mission done. The story has a very light-hearted sort of feel; while not necessarily geared towards kids, the plot and progress may turn some players off as they may see it as somewhat immature. The game is good, but similar to Star Ocean in many aspects.

The Good:
-Short Learning Curve
-Enjoyable Cast of Characters (some)
-Nice Graphics
-Fun Combat Engine

The Bad:
-Considered an ""inferior"" Star Ocean
-Some parts of the game drag
-Appears to be geared towards kids
-Music is repetitive and forgettable

The Ugly:
-The character portraits during dialogue

---------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------

The game is good in its own merits; however, if you're anything like me, you still won't find this game as appealing as other role-playing games out there. Being one of the few GOOD Gamecube role-playing games out there, I see it not ranking as high among others.

My BIGGEST personal issue (which may apply to some others and may have to do with your style of RPGs) was its poor pacing. The game fleshes out a story I have come to like; however, there are breaks in the game where the story doesn't pick up for hours. I've logged a good 20 hours into the game and have just come across a shocking turn of events in the game; unfortunately, I'm back to running from town to town running through a series of events that are detracting from the MAIN and FAR MORE INTERESTING story.

I could get past running through the same labyrinths/dungeons/Ranches twice--once to progress the story, the second time to obtain a summon (pertaining to the dungeons/labyrinths), but the world map isn't the most pleasant to stroll through as random encounters are far too often (the onscreen enemies often come out of nowhere and attack you slowing down the progress). The worst part of exploring the labyrinths and dungeons would be the respawning enemies patrolling its floor.

Some of the dungeon's puzzles the game could have done without...it's as if they threw them in last minute. The overall objective of some of treks through these locations could have done away with some of the redundant puzzles (since there are so many enemy encounters) and the ring used to solve puzzles was more of a nuisance.

It's a tough call with this game as I introduced myself to this series when I purchased my gamecube a little while back. It starts off good, it progresses well for a little while, it gets better, then it begins to drag. It picks up the pace very well with a very, very interesting plot twist or turn of events, then it drags again. You solve some puzzles--some pointless and some clever, you go through a series of events that are seemingly out of place, and so forth. The most disheartening part of the game (to me) was trekking the world map as I wanted to immediately jump back into the story. Newcomers MAY or MAY NOT enjoy this game, long time fans; however, will love this game.

+Pros:
+The story is GREAT
+Engaging and Fun Battle system
+

-Cons:
-Pacing is very poor and the progression of story is spaced out because of side-events, obtaining summons, and random characters
-There is probably one or two characters whos personalities may wear thin with players
-Revisiting the same areas twice can be a drag
-No vehicle...scaling the world map can be a pain for the first...15 hours

??:
-Graphic style may or may not appeal to everybody
-Some may or may not be turned off by the character interactions",neutral
2051,"The gameplay is good, controls aren't so bad. Story Designer mode is cool, however my problem with it is you only get 2 slots in which to save your created stories. Also, it sucks that in this game, female wrestlers can't have male opponents. Not to mention, not even a created Diva, in the Super Heavywieght class can lift the ring steps. Have THQ, Yukes & Jakks Pacific forgotten that there is a former WWE Diva who can easily lift those things? To anyone from the above-mentioned companies who may be reading this, here's the name of that Diva: Joany Laurer, formerly known as CHYNA! And, let's see, the whole thing with female wrestlers unable to face male opponents: hmmm...from the very first Smackdown (PS1) through SVR 2009, you can have males and females face each other. SVR 2010, nope! At least, however, they've made a slight improvement by restoring the freedom to select female wrestlers for extreme, hardcore style matches. These guys keep wanting to make the WWE Smackdown games more realistic, yet they keep putting all this unrealistic crap in them. Oh, yes, also the Mixed Tag Team match sucks. Why? Because you're stuck with the damn DQ being on!",negative
2052,"Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest was one of those random games that somene picked me up for a birthday for VERY cheap at Target back in the day. There was a reason for it. :)

I do not want to be instantly harsh on it, because the reality, I had a good time with it. For those that do not know...Americans made this Final Fantasy. I could stop there. That is not to bash my country but back then, we were not known for our strong game development skills when it came to RPGs, especially with a strong pedogree like the Japanese studio Square was known for. (Namesake only for this one)

With JRPG's being all the rage back then, it was a shock that this game was even developed to begin with. It was simply not needed, but before I continue to bash it, lets talk about what it did good.

I really liked the idea of seeing where enemies were. For us Final Fantasy lovers, the random encounter system of getting into a fight is annoying and frustrating. You hope that you have just 3-4 squares left to get to the next story part and BOOM a fight. Usually just power mashing 1 button to spam the ""attack"" command and you were done. The reality, lets be real, that was a lot of our RPG experience on Super Nintendo, but we loved it. Anyway, that was a nice addition. The fights were the same old over and over, but showing us enemy encounter locations was nice. There was also no over map. There was but not one that you have full control over navigation. It basically brings you from 1 place to another and its not free running around like we were accustomed too in Final Fantasy 2.

It was crazy easy to get into because of its really simple design, which was nice, and the graphics were not TERRIBLE....though, surely not Final Fantasy 2 (US) level (which came out before this). The game also was not hard at all. I rarely recall ever dying unless I really was not paying attention.

The story was your standard bad guys doing bad things as always, so there was not much depth to this almost arcade feeling RPG, but in the end, I complete the game and was happy to say I did.
However, this is not a game that holds up well today at all and frankly, ill probably never play it again.",negative

2054,I like this game because I can test my knowledge on stuff I know and also learn new things.  I like watching jeopardy on tv.  I guess it is as close to playing it in person as I can get.,positive
2055,"First, a controller is a must (preferably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-360-Wired-Controller/dp/B003ZSN600/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox 360 Wired Controller</a>) to play this game.  As a PC gamer (snob) it's a little aggravating but this game is impossible to play without one.  The menu system takes a little getting used to as you use the controller sticks to choose your options.  Once you figure things out this game is a lot of fun to play.  ""Please support PC baseball.""

The commentary is amazing, frankly.  In 2K10 it started to get repetitive at times if you made the same type of pitch or hit to the same side of the field, for instance.  In 2K11 it really sounds like they're analyzing your game as you play it.  They even talk about specific milestones like your first day in the majors.  It really adds to the immersion.

The player behaviors, on the other hand, seem to have taken a step backwards.  One guy showed up to the plate half underground.  The game engine sometimes gets stuck for a few seconds after certain events.  You'll move your player around and the guy sits there for a moment then starts flailing around wildly a few seconds later.  Every time I leave the pitchers mound to go to the bullpen I run smack into the opposing team's coach and they dance around one another.  I'll do a stellar job in career mode with a ton of skill points earned and my coach will chastise my ""awful"" performance.  None of this is gamebreaking but it's a lot of really weird game glitches that didn't exist in last year's version.

2K Games *finally* fixed the problem with training drills.  The main reason I purchased 2K11 was because it was impossible to practice specific skills like hitting or fielding in 2K10.  It was just completely broken on the PC and they never patched the problem; at least on the Steam version.  In 2K11 when you start a career (My Player) you're able to work on your skills before starting a game.  Pitching seems a little slower in this year's version, I'm always swinging too early on the plate.  It's an adjustment.  Aside from that and new player stats it seems largely unchanged from 2K10.

If you're a baseball fan with controller in hand and just want to play some ball against a friend or the computer, you'll be happy with either version but I think 2K10 is the better game.  If you want to play career mode and build a player's abilities from the minors up, you'll need 2K11.",negative

While some were logically challenging, some of the controls were confusing, that is you could turn something, but not see any real on-screen indication of what was really going on.  I didn't really get a sense of satisfaction upon completing a world, or the game for all things.

Writing on the tablets was fun, and I don't agree with the comments that the game couldn't recognize what you wrote.  Even I, a really bad artist had very few instances where the game didn't accept what I had drawn.

2064,"Here is a game that could have been so much better than it is.  Even so, it makes an entertaining, if lesser chapter into the Kingdom Hearts Series.

First the good.  The game controls great.  Clever use of shortcuts makes magic casting a breeze and the action for better or worse in primarily controlled by mashing on the A button, occasionally using B and Y to jump and block/roll respectively.  The fighting is good for what it is, but mostly it is a bit simplistic.

Sadly the whole game is a bit simplistic.  It is clear the developers wanted to focus on graphics and story.  What they wound up with is a game that looks almost as good as its PS2 counterparts.  The story on the other hand is a bit muddled and what starts out as a cute bromance turns into a constant irritation.  My god, I don't care about them eating icecream for the 85th day in a row.

Also missing from the game is any bit of exploration.  The worlds are depressingly simple and small, generally consisting of a few large rooms or spaces with few more caves/rooms opening up later in your missions.  That brings me to the other big problem with the game which is the mission structure.  Simply put, it is not nearly as fun as just a regular Kingdom Hearts game.  85% of the missions boil down to either kill a bunch of Heartless or kill one specific Heartless.  It begins to drag with a flustering amount of sameness.  Every once in a while you will come across an exploration mission which generally involves running around until a question mark pops up over Roxas's hear and you press A.  There are also a few missions that you have to follow a character, which are about as dumb as they sound.

The characters from Disney and other Square series are pushed to the backburner here as well, it is mostly about Organization XIII and run parallel to the events of Chain of Memories.

The final problem with the game, as alluded to by other reviewers is the panel system, which seems to be an odd combination of a card game, the materia system from Final Fantasy VII and Diablo's loot system.  You can place different panels into your inventory to do basically anything including learn moves and magic.  The most irritating panel could be the level up panel.  This is certainly the first game where you have to equip a level up.  You get to make irritating decisions such as ""Do I level up or take 'cure' into the battle""  Do I want more casts of fire or to have the ability to block.  It seems some things, such as new tactics and level ups should be automatic.  I guess it adds in a new strategy to the game, but mostly I find it irritating.

That all being said, if you can look past the irritants, there is a lot of fun to be had here, especially for those who are already fans (for those that haven't played KH before, good luck following the story).  This one is for the fans only.",neutral
2065,"I am a huge fan of Breath of Fire 2 and can play it for hours and days on end.  I was hoping the first one would be just as addicting.  Unfortunately I was less than impressed, but at least I have yet another vintage SNES game within my collection. :)",neutral
2066,"UPDATED on 11/5/2010 after much more time with the game.

While this is a much better game than 2010, it is once again a glaring hole of issues that Yukes and THQ never disappoint on. You will have the regular amount of kids and adults who turn a blind eye to these things, claiming the game is perfect, but you will be SORELY DISAPPOINTED if you listen to these people. I have spent quite a lot of time with the game so far, and while it is a decent title from Yukes for the first time in 4 or 5 years, it just doesn't get up to par with what they promised (shocking I know.)

THE PROS
--------

-The new physics system is decent, but it will give you problems like anything else. The tables break on cue and work well, but some weapons like chairs, fall apart with one grapple attack. The major issue with the physics system isn't it's set-up how ever, just that in typical Yukes' fashion, they're too lazy to reanimate 6 or 7 year old moves, so getting someone put through a table is only doable with moves they fixed or are brand-new, which is about maybe 10% of them if that. Other than that, you have to REALLY get things lined up for it to work.

-Much larger and fuller roster gives you a ton of selection once you have everyone unlocked, and when (if) they release the DLC you will get another 8 or 10.

-A new ability allows you to counter certain attacks into pinfalls, which can be reversed into pinfalls as well. A friend of mine and I did about 6 reversals and it looked seamless each time.

-Match Creator gives you a LOT more options on what to do during a match, and you can even create your own match, though it's VERY limited.

THE CONS
--------

While I can go on and on about little aspects in the game... the list of cons are what will make it or break it for a lot of people with this game. Yes... playing with friends is really fun, because two human controlled players can have an awesome time and not get bored. In a 60 minute Iron Man Match, the time flew by like it was just a few minutes.

-Real life active Titles ONLY can be defended in Universe Mode. This causes a lot less replayability in my mind. You MUST have Universe Mode turned on, and only #1 Contenders can challenge for Titles... ONLY at PPV's. Basically, if you want someone to have a belt, you need to go into the create mode and assign it to them, unless you want to spend 2-3 hours working for it. This kills a major aspect of the game lasting as far as I'm concerned.

-Glaring mis-spells. So far in two RTWM's I have seen three clear spelling mistakes in the captions, and by default, the game has Taker and Kane labeled the ""Brother of Destruction."" To me at least, these is just really unprofessional by Yukes for allowing crap like that to go through.

-Most wrestlers by default all have the same regular moves. Almost all wrestlers have the following; Running DDT, running STO, shoulder block, clothesline, grapple DDT... the list goes on. It looks like they spent the better part of 2 hours assigning the entire roster their moves. Most of us will spend hours and hours reassigning all the workers, as half of them are missing certain moves they use all the time, which are in the game. Inexcusable for me!

-Backstage in RTWM. Boring... boring... boring! The area is sizable enough to where every character in the game could be hanging around, but usually only 3-5 are around at a time, and interaction is so limited, you wonder why they bothered! You can talk to a wrestler, which will almost always result in them insulting you. Then you can shove them 3 times to start a brawl. This is about 80% of what backstage interaction is all about.

-Too easy to reverse everything. Even with the meter turned all the way down and the difficulty cranked, it's too easy to reverse everything the computer does. Once you get the timing down, you really cannot lose.

-Matches are WAY too quick. On average, Easy to Hard difficulty your matches will last about 45 seconds if you're really pushing for the victory in 1 on 1 matches.

-Over 100 Universe cutscenes? I've only seen the same 4 repeat over and over and over again! Someone buys a ticket and sits in the front row... someone goes to the announce table and you never hear from them, and there is also the attack on the ramp, and the sneak attack through the crowd. After boasting 100 scenes, I'm really hard-pressed to find out where the others come in!

-Universe Mode gets boring VERY fast. It is nearly impossible to work your way up to a WWE or World Title bout unless you win the Rumble or MITB, because the system tries to keep you at Intercontinental or United States Title level at all times. Heck, I can't even get my CAW into a MITB match, and he's never lost a bout in 3 years game time! Even after a year's time from winning the World Title, I took it off him to see where he would rank, and is still nowhere near any contention to the World Title... JUST the US Title.

-For a mode that claims to be fully customizable, you are so limited with Universe Mode, it's almost absurd. If you edit a scheduled match for one of your own, it doesn't count towards the rankings. If you touch ANYTHING in Match Creator for a Title match, it will change it to a regular bout. You can't even add a manager!

-CAWs is much more limited this year. It seems as though hundreds of pieces of items and designs were removed. I can no longer make myself like I could in other games, because what I used for my attire is no longer there in any sense.

-Want to put a custom tool design on your CAW? Download one or make one and knock yourself out... but then you can't use that CAW online ""just in case"" it's offensive. I put the Nexus logo on my CAW, now I can't use him online. BULL!

-When you do win a Championship, Michael Cole will always proclaim; ""If this happens on Sunday, we will have a new Champion!""

-Online STILL HAS MAJOR LAG! I tried fighting a guy online last night, and I couldn't do anything. Apparently he has been playing with the lag for years, because he was spamming moves left and right, and used a ridiculous multi-tiered finisher that took almost 30 seconds to complete, and he used it almost 10 times before I couldn't kick out anymore. When you try to do something in an online match, there is a half second delay... EVERY TIME. Worthless!

-The Legends suck. Same old... same old. We've seen all these guys before multiple times. If you can't put anyone different in, Yukes, STOP PUTTING IN LEGENDS! You would think these guys are currently in the WWE since half of them have been in almost every single release since 1999.

-MITB is almost impossible to win past Easy setting. With the physics system, the ladder is always constantly being knocked down when you try to climb it. Any time someone does a move while you're climbing, the ladder goes down immediately, even it's barely touched.

-The RTWM's are terrible, aside from Christian's. Rey loses his memory, Undertaker's is filled with cosmic garbage set for a bad 1980's movie... INCLUDING a Bill & Ted Time Machine Phonebooth! Cena's is about his staler than heck feud with Orton, and I haven't even touched Jericho's because I'm sick of trying to play them.

All in all, while this game could be very fun for you, pick wisely. If you haven't liked previous Smackdown games, RENT IF FIRST because you may be very upset at spending $60 on a game when once again, Yukes promises and delivers on very little. The game will give me longevity because I play it a lot with friends, but as a single player game, you will get sick of it VERY quickly. I urge anyone who is thinking about buying it, PLEASE save your money and play it a friend's who has it, or rent it first. If you buy this game brand new thinking it's going to be a complete over-haul, and worked on greatly to be a better game, you will get a hard kick in the face by reality.

As I said, it's great fun with human players in the same room. My friend and I just recently spent 2 hours battling each other in a 6 Man Elimination Tag and it was just great fun.

But on your own... the game is just the same old repeating nonsense.",neutral
2067,"Just a quick review, I know there are a ton of reviews, so I'm just going to state the basics.

Please note, my unit came with two controllers with 'snes' style plugs, so it's possible that I'm using a newer revision than other reviewers.

---------------------
UPDATE: (NOV 2016)

This thing has eaten TWO of my save files already...

Kirby dreamland 3 (SFC) Plugged in second controller, (as I've done [mid game] many times) and the game froze.
 Restarted my system, and the save file was gone.

Super mario RPG (SNES) pressed the 'reset' button and it reset my save file.

Most other games I've tried worked without issue, but since it's happened more than once now, I'm gonna have to dock a dock a star.
-----------

Positive:
+ Plays every snes game I can throw at it. Starfox, fzero,kirby3, gameboy player? no problem!
+ Of the few NES games I've tired, it plays most with no issues.
+  I only own 1 genesis game, but it plays it fine
+ Fits and plays both Snes and (Japanese) Super famicom games
+ Supports real controllers(nes/snes/gen), and you can play nes games or gen games with real snes controllers!
+ compact power adapter. no more huge OEM plugs
+Supports S-Video! Nice and sharp video on snes/gen (nes works with s-video plug, but it's not true s-video, and it makes the nes look worse)
+ Compact and light weight.
+ Allows all slots to be occupied when running, and you can use the power switch to switch consoles

Negatives:
-Snes sound sounds very off. If you're coming from a real snes it's pretty noticeable, but most people will not care.
The snes had a dedicated sound processor made by sony, I'd imagine it's hard to simulate.

-NES support could be better, most the games I tried did work, but I could not get the duckhunt/mario bros double cart to boot.
and I had some flickering in metal gear.

-No Snes multitap support.
I own 4 super bomber man titles. it's a shame I will not be able to really use them on this system. the game's vs mode is no fun with only 2 people.

-NES DEATH GRIP, most of the systems allow you to remove the carts fairly easily, but the nes games hold on for dear life!

-No famicom support out of the box, how much more would it have cost to include an adapter? oh well,  it's not a big deal for most people

- Dose not support the snes official AV plug, not really a big deal, it uses normal plugs, so they are cheaper to replace.
But that means, there is very little hope for a RGB mod.

- Can't play gbc games.
It supports GB though the super gameboy, and gba games through their own adapter (sold separate), but it has no way to play gbc games. :'(

...And that's all I can think of.  I'll update this post when I know more.

At $60, it's still a good deal, a usa SNES alone would run you more than that. And no clone console is perfect,
But this one is as close as you can get!

Sure there are 'emulator boxes' like the retron5 out. But for something that give you the retro feel, and still works with CRT's  I'd go with this!",negative
2068,This isn't Elder Scrolls as we know and love it. I wouldn't buy this again in hind sight. It's a very different game and I don't really like it. Look at it compared to Final Fantasy's recent MMO for a better comparison. This is not Elder Scrolls as we know it.,positive

2070,"OK... Maybe I was expecting a little more from Wappy.

Wappy barks, sits, stands and whines. Kind of annoying... Not exactly my idea of long term entertainment except for maybe a child 5 years or younger. My granddaughter is 8 and after a while she was pretty much bored. Takes 3 AA batteries which are not included.

There are 6 mini games for home mode and 5 mini games for travel mode. The games are also limited and the technical aspects are almost too simple and plain.
This toy is definitely for the younger kids (3-5)",negative
2071,"I bought the Pets expansion pack in December of last year and I was really excited to try it out. Unfortunately it has been a huge disappointment - it isn't much fun at all. You can't control your Pets and if you have even a medium sized family - such as husband, wife, one or two kids - having to feed the pet, wash the pet (if you have a dog), play with the pet, teach the pet tricks, etc gets to be a bit much. I find that my families inadvertantly ignore thier animals because there are more immediate things to do, like build skills for work or network to make more friends or help the kids with their homework. The one thing I do like about having a pet is you can get them a job and they can bring in decent money. Some pet jobs make $800+ simoleans per day, which is a nice chunk of change to add to the family funds.
Besides cats and dogs, you can also buy a bird cage and put an exotic bird in it. You can teach the birds to talk, which also fills your Sims' social meter and builds the charisma skill. I'm not so great at taking care of the birds though, because I've had so many of them die on me when I forget to have someone feed them.
You can also buy a womrat, which looks alot like a ferret - womrats don't really do much and you don't gain anything by having one. They're cute, that's about it. I've had a few womrats die on me too.
When the cats or dogs die the Grim Reaper comes for them just like he does when a Sim dies - I can't say I've been sad to see any of my Pets go. I recommend this expansion pack to animal lovers who would enjoy adding a dog or a cat to their game. Otherwise I really don't feel that Pets adds enough to the game to justity buying it - save your RAM for something fun like Seasons or Nightlife.",positive
2072,"Problem 1:
Was my fault entirely. I gave it as a Christmas gift having no idea we needed a special Wii remote to play it. I didn't know motion plus was something different than we already had, since out Wii remotes buzzed and vibrated with our current games.

Problem 2:
The Wii motion plus is really sensitive no matter what setting my son used. This made game play very difficult for my pre-teen.

Problem 3:
Because of problem 2 my son had a terrible time hitting targets, flying etc. and has since quit playing without getting very far.

Problem 4:
My wasted money is wasted. I now have a fifty dollar controller and fifty dollar game no one wants.

Problem 5:
I am sad and my son is sad.

My son saved up his Christmas money and bought a used copy of Zelda Phantom Hourglass that he loves. Go figure.

Unless you REALLY love Zelda and are willing to practice a lot with the new Wii motion plus controller, or have a naturally steady hand, I don't think I'd recommend this game.",negative
2073,it is OK,positive
2074,"This game has a lot going for it, the most notable feature being a return to two-dimentions with 3D elements.  The concept of blazing speed and a game that practically played itself never quite translated properly to 3D, which  I personally attribute to the extra space.  Back in two dimentions it's possible to present the player with a fast paced course that will yank control away and give it back in just the right dosage to get the adrenaline flowing and at the same time present the player with a sense of unbroken speed.

I'd also like to heap praise upon Sonics stylus controlled Sonic 2 style bonus stages, and I found that the hang glider stage and the return of old classics like gravity varied levels, hydroplaning, and spiral loops have at last returned in a manageable 2D format, and a decent soundtrack is once again overlaid with this newest offering.  The introduction of jump tricks and Sonics ""dash meter"" add an almost Tony Hawk feel to large jumps and ramps, and give the player something new to do while the game plays itself.

However, this game has several flaws that I simply couldn't get past.  For one thing, the game suffers from the same campy dialogue and didactic ""let's all be freinds"" messages that have plagued the House of Sonic for the better part of ten years now.  The introduction of yet another new character is (for a change) welcomed in the form of Blaze, whose fire special effects make her an interesting play.  The next note is a problem that I have encountered hasn't really been faced by Sonic games in the past.  There are an inordinant number of bottomless death pits, which breaks strictly from Sonic tradition.  The idea of instant death upon failure to successfully complete a jumping puzzle has appeared before in the sky levels, however, in this game almost every stage comes with a large pitfall with no alternate route at the bottom.  The third issue I take with this game is the redundant bosses from stages 1 and 5 respectively, who present the player with an almost identical challenge.  Last, I find that this is probably the most easily defeated Death Egg variant that I've ever palyed against, and I'm deeply dissapointed.  I would call everyone to remember the Death Egg from Sonic and Knuckles, that presented the player with a genuine challenge the likes of which this newest Death Egg (or whatever we like to call the end game giant robot boss these days) does not.

Overall I'm very happy to see Sonic back in two dimentions, but I'm afrad that he's still getting bogged down with some of the campy sidekicks and failed experiments from his 3D career, and that unfortunately weighs down my opinion of this game, but I would still reccomend playing it, I'd just suggest that you borrow it from a freind rather than pay the full retail for it.",positive
2075,"It's a good game, with an interesting storyline. I couldn't help but notice all the hype going for this series, so I bought the game. Personally, the game started off with a gun fight, but that left me hoping for a game with tons of action, instead I felt like the game was a little slow at getting to the exciting parts. If you're a person that loves the call of duty series and is expecting this game to be the same level of action, you most likely won't find that here. For those who like adventure in their games with a pretty decent amount of action, you'll love this. I'm more of the call of duty guy, where there is action like every 10 seconds.",positive
2076,I mainly bought this because of C&C Generals. But most of the other games are fairly good. It's updated so almost every game is in HD.,negative
2077,"I ordered this because I was having trouble keeping my Wii connected to my wireless router. Every time I turned on my Wii to watch a movie, I was having to reenter my connect information every time. I read in a review that said this would help solve the problem. Well the problem was somewhat solved. instead of having to input all the steps of connecting to your wireless router, I only have to go through one step. I guess that's better than all 4 or 5 steps.",positive
2078,"I won't go into detail about the storyline and such since it's well-covered by other reviewers.  I will say that having played the original Fable, I enjoyed some of the changes Lionhead made but disappointed in many others.  Many fellow customers note the lack of depth in the storyline, and characters, especially the villains.  I liken this situation to the contrast between Batman: Vengeance (which was great) to Rise of Sin Tzu (total flop.)  Like the difference between the two Batman games , Lionhead didn't give us what we were salivating for these past years when we picked up wind of this sequel coming out.  Overall, good graphics, decent gameplay--through the non critical eye of a player new to the series, I think they would enjoy it.  But most of us have played the original and we are disappointed in this product that appears to have been thrown together and tossed to us like dog food.",negative
2079,just started to learn  how to use it,negative
2080,"If you are a Vandetta Fanatic or just a fight fan, DJFFY is definitely going to make you wanna spend a couple of nites at home.

 Right from the beginning the graphics are far better than DJV, but this may also be the source of the problem for this game as well(explain later). The ability to select your player's design is off the hook, especially with the clothes,and jewelery options (my female friend is loving that for sure).

  The biggest gripe I have on the PS2 version is it freezes - it freezes alot!! It's not enough to dislike playing but after a while it can be irritating, especially in the midst of a fight, you execute a move only to find out the computer was able to counter and crack you one.

  One review someone complained how easily the opponents get back up but my on advice to that is play an easier mode or learn to play your skills better.

  All and all, this is definite the best fighting game I've seen this year. Despite the freezing (which may only happen on a PS2) this game is a must have even if its just to see Kimora Lee and LiL Kim get at it.",positive
2081,"Impressive quality case. I was looking for basic protection for my new modded DS4 controller so I didn't expect a lot for the price but was impressed with what I got.

The case comes loosely wrapped in a plastic bag and along with the case they include a silver colored carabiner that actually seems pretty decent. The inside of the case also has a mesh elastic pocket on the top portion of the case which I imagine is to hold a cable for your controller.

The shell material is reasonably sturdy and feels of good quality materials. There are two zipper pulls made of rubber and the zip is smooth and nice. The most surprising part for me was the interior lining of the case. It isn't just that felt-like material, it is very lush soft material that looks and feels very nice.

Now despite me being pleasantly surprised by the case there are a few issues with the case and one that would be a deal breaker for some. The main issue is that when the case closes, there is little to no clearance for the standard joysticks meaning that any stress put on the case is directly putting stress on the joysticks. You can actually lightly press the outside of the case near the joysticks and feel the click of R3 and L3.  This seems to equal little protection for the joysticks which defeats the purpose of a protective travel case.

Now for myself, I modded the controller to use the Xbox One Elite removable joysticks so if I remove the joysticks for storage then the case can still work well to protect the controller. You could even store the joysticks in the netted mesh pocket but if stored loosely in this pocket, they will be loose in the case.

Speaking of the mesh pocket, it seems to be mostly useless. I've tried storing a cable but even with my joysticks removed, there just isn't enough clearance for the cable to fit well with the controller. You can make it fit but I'm not looking to squeeze everything into this case.

Considering this happens to work for me I'm willing to give it 3 stars but considering most won't have removable joysticks, I just can't recommend this for protecting your DS4 for travel. If you know what you're getting here, don't mind the issues, and appreciate the quality of the case then it's not bad but buyer beware. It is affordable at around $10 but the design deficiencies will turn many off.",positive
2082,"Fatal Frame 2 is a slick and atmosphere-laden game full of great graphics and spooky sounds. Sadly, it gets all of these great attributes by copying them from the highly effective first game, and not by adding anything new itself. Impressive games have often been followed by equally impressive sequels, so why did I find this one less effective than it could have been?
Well, to start with, the haunted mansion of the first game was foreboding and terrifying, a deathtrap that oozed menace from every corner. Collapsed masonry and rotten furnishings gave a realistic air of paranormal inhabitance. The second game uses an entire deserted village as its location, but a lot of it is quite drab and empty, and the sense of claustophobia is drastically diluted when you go outside, as you are meandering through streets and open areas instead of confined corridors and annexes. The other reason I felt less afraid was that the ghosts just didn't cause the goosebumps I got in the first game, which featured apparitions of people who suffered traumatic deaths like the girl with the broken back, or the woman with her eyes ripped out, as well as totally evil prescences like the man with the unnaturally long arms. The ghosts in FF2  often just look like real people, sometimes attacking you with sabres or flaming torches like any other survival horror enemies, so you don't feel the chill of having to battle a tortured soul who is crying in pain. In fact one set of ghosts in the sequel is a bunch of children who surround you and play ""tag"" with you...hmmm, I'm getting nostalgic for the first game just writing this. There are plenty of hidden and vanishing ghosts to test your reflexes on, so at least that provides the same level of fun. Sadly, the control system is also still the same, and it's still awful. Mio and Mayu are devishly hard to control because every camera angle change means you lose the direction you are going in and bump into everything (which led to much screaming from me when trying to run towards some of the valuable ""miss 'em and they're gone"" ghosts). But luckily the Options screen does give you the choice between this and the Resident Evil-style of movement, so if you can't make this one work, you can switch to that one, which is a definite plus. But, once again the ""run"" mode is nothing more than a dainty trot which looks far too twee coming from characters who are supposedly fighting for their lives.
Actually, the two sisters are far less engaging characters than Miku in the first game, who looked and acted a bit feistier, and had some really horrific events to contend with. Although the plot in the sequel does gradually reveal some interesting twists and fateful turns of events for our heroines, the atmosphere never gets as dark as it could due to the fact that this pair are drawn like two big eyed, cute-faced girlies with doll-like expressions that barely change, so they did not get my sympathy or interest, and were just too drippy, especially Mayu, who spends 90% of the game as your computer controlled partner and just gets in the way all the time.
So, even though a sequel that simply refines it's predecessor can result in a better game, that hasn't happened here in my opinion. For anyone that is a newcomer, and likes the sound of this type of game, go and get the first one immediately. The whole camera sytem and the power ups that can be earned for it, the ghost attacks and the horrific explanation behind the unfiolding events  work perfectly and effectively in that one, producing an all-round classic game. This one is a simple retread with two lead characters instead of one, and a re-hashed but less gripping plot. Plus, the explanation of why taking pictures of ghosts will actually defeat them is mostly just glossed over here, whereas in the first game, Miku had a personal connection to the mysterious camera, which made its supernatural abilities a bit clearer.
 I'll balance this rather negative list with a few pros; namely that the game seems a fair bit longer than the first, with more chapters and more places to go. And at some points along the way (just a few), the ghost encounters prove exceptionally difficult. The battles are still fun, though. Plenty of tactical planning is needed, as well as nerves of steel because once again, the most effective photos can only be taken the moment before a ghost moves in for the kill. But in conclusion, I have to say that although the whole package is well delivered, and probably above average for a ""survival-chiller"" game, this time I just don't feel the hairs on my neck standing up.",negative
2083,"The first thing you'll notice is just how expansive and beautiful this open world game is. It almost puts GTA V to shame in its draw distances and overall performance - especially remarkable given how limited the horsepower is of the Xbox One. Overall the game is fun but not enough to drag me into a 30+ hour commitment.

It feels like more of the same to me. Yes it's slightly different than other military shooters out there. Yes it employs a good amount of strategy into the mix with your squad and commands, etc. Is it fun? Sure. Uninspired? Yes.

Just like the motion picture industry big budget game studios pump out the same stuff with more technology or a slightly different twist on a genre to differentiate a game just enough from similar ones. This one does that. It looks gorgeous but after awhile you'll feel like you've played this game before.

Ubisoft needed a redemption and this title certainly does it for them. Unfortunately playing it safe and keeping the company afloat doesn't move the needle on creating new and innovative gameplay that would captivate me enough to invest any more time in it.

If you're into these kind of games you'll love it. For the rest of us? Yawn. You've been here before.. and likely again.",positive
2084,"3 might be a little harsh, but I'm hypersensitive about this game.  They should have done better, and in some ways I think the game is worse.

First off the gameplay is different, more organic, more rag doll, not as l easy to cheese.  This is the best thing about the game.

If you are a 2K collector, or just a collector, sure get the Kobe Legacy Gold Edition.  However if you aren't a collector I wouldn't bother with it. The best part is the 100K of VC, but you'll blow through it fast.

I got it cuz I'm a huge Kobe fan, but disappointed what you get.  A Kobe poster that's just a replica of the cover, a mouse pad of the cover that I thought was lame, but if you need a mouse pad sure.  A Kobe Topps card, that I thought was cool.  A Kobe controller skin, but that won't last long.  The in game Kobe My Team is a 5 game card, I thought that was weak.  Were paying $100 for this edition and we can't get a permanent Kobe card ?

The shoe collection isn't complete only some off his shoes, that was false advertisement.  The jerseys are team USA jerseys and one yellow Laker jersey, and a Team USA Jordan Jersey which looks better than Kobes jerseys.  Also you get a Kobe in game jacket that one is pretty cool.

Don't get this if you are a Kobe fan IMO, only get this if you are a collector.

Soundtrack again is awesome,they hit it outta the Park every year to me.

My Team Online is a little different, a little better, more goal driven I like that.  There's Also a single player goal completion thing that you earn coins  if you complete to unlock player.  That's cool.  However collecting cards is harder this year, will take longer.

Gauntlet is now called Blacktop.  Again the gameplay is improved so that you'll like but blacktop is not as well done as last year.  You get to open one flipping card if you win, one ! Plus your random players you play with are generally better than last years, not many bad cards, but the way you get them by picking colored cards off a fast conveyor belt is lame.

Substitutions is hilariously bad it's like a puzzle to sub guys in now it's a joke. Horrible.

You can't match up in the Park and Guantlet like you could in 14, still auto matches you to your opponent.  Lame.

The Park has a camera screen tear as it rotates after a made basket where I am blinded from the court for a few seconds, so annoying ! They didn't fix it with the first big patch and that ticked me off.  Wouldn't respond to me on Twitter when I asked nicely about it.

What else ?  I don't care for my career mode storyline,.  Same shi# every year with different actors.  However I did enjoy Spikes dark story last year and his awesome Jazz music, few liked it but me.  The prelude was more fun than my career this year but didn't go in depth this year, just played park games to get my guy up.  Park is the same as last year other than that screen tear issue and  will take longer to be a legend.  You get 500K VC when you become legend so you know it will be a war to get there.

That's about it.  So get this if you are a collector, but if your just a Kobe fan like me,bjustvgetvthe standard.  But I gotta say I just sold it for $50, cuz these things above ticked me off and I expected better. I'm  going back to play 16 myself.  COD is about to come out, really want to play old school MW.

 Again the gameplay is better, can't cheese as much, only get this edition of you are a collector.  Buyers remorse as a Kobe fan myself.  Just get standard edition if you are a die hard, or pass on it and wait for next years.  Hope this helped, just being honest.

2085,"Reading the review section for Kings Bounty: The Legend I couldn't help myself and had to write my own review. I see a lot of references and comparisons made to Heroes of Might and Magic and I wish to add my point of view.

I have to point out that I have played Heroes of Might and Magic 1-5 with all official add-ons. Therefore I feel qualified to compare Kings Bounty: The Legend (hereafter KBTL) and Heroes of Might and Magic (hereafter HoMM).

I could simply state that comparing KBTL and HoMM would be to compare Fallout3 and Counter Strike, both of the later are First Person Shooters, but, oh, what a different gameplay! Since that would, however, be a cross genre reference I will go into detail about those two Turn Based Strategy Games.

KBTL offers a compelling story and one of three Heroes (all male) to explore the game world. The heroes look different and offer a different gameplay in battles, but except for one specialty skill, they all use the same skill tree. There are plenty of side quests and each decision will have an effect on the further game experience - that did not surprise you now, did it? The player is in control of his one hero and will, for the most part, just have to take care of him and his army. Gold and runes are the only resources to keep track of - runes to buy new skills and gold to hire new units. An interesting factor is leadership, which controls how many units of a certain kind the hero can control. Exceed that limit and the unit will do what it wants, even attack friendly stacks. The main story line is linear - until you do what you have been told, no new creatures will be available for hire, no new quests will be given and you are confined to the areas open for exploration at that time.

HoMM is a different kind of game, as it is not centered on an individual hero under the player's control, but is a strategy game. The player uses one or more experience gaining heroes to conquer recourse producing mines (there are six recourses), cities and other dwellings; uses the proceeds to fortify and upgrade the cities under his control and to hire new creatures for his armies. Build certain dwellings in your cities and more and better creatures are available for hire. Several races and their corresponding cities are playable, each with their own heroes and units. Hero skill trees differ greatly from race to race, and each hero does have his/her unique specialty. The game offers multiple maps and even a map editor, or the option of the random map generator - a unique map on the spot. In these maps the player will compete, with the AI for a fixed objective, most often total domination. HoMM has multi-player options for online play or in hotseat mode to play in front of one computer. For the solo-player there are campaigns for each race that follow a story line, but the story will usually unfold step by step on different maps.

In summary, besides the fact that the player controls a hero(s) with stacks of units and battles take place on a grid, Heroes of Might and Magic and Kings Bounty: The Legend do not have much in common.

The story drives Kings Bounty: The Legend, but that also reduces the replay value for me. I think Heroes of Might and Magic is a better buy and offers more repeated and therefore longer overall entertainment and enjoyment.",positive
2086,"I'll start with the biggest con - the image quality isn't all that great. That's it. That's the con.

The build quality of this thing is good - Sony could have put slightly better cameras in here, but I understand that they're trying to make this thing both affordable and long lasting. There are two lenses here, which means future connectivity with 3D content, and depth perception for applications that will use it.

At this point, the primary reason for buying one of these is to stream your gameplay. You can either stream full screen, which will put your face in the top right corner (right on top of any HUD elements or gameplay) - which will make you unable to read any messages viewers may toss your way. Or you can crop the gameplay down to about 80% of the TV. The remaining 20% are for messages from Twitchtv viewers and your own face on the camera.

At the moment, hundreds of thousands of players are streaming. You're going to need a VERY GOOD REASON for people to watch your stream instead of the other hundreds of thousands out there (This number is increasing. There may be more than a million streams by the 1 year anniversary of the ps4). Are you famous? Are you one of the best players in the world? If the answer is no to either of these - chances are not a lot of people are going to be watching you play. If you have an ego to sustain - well, just remember to wear some clothes - in the extremely rare event that someone actually does drop in to view your stream.

Now, streaming aside, there are several other reasons to use this device:
1. Voice commands. Not sure why you would rather say ""Show the world map"" rather than click the R3 joystick, but you have the option. Maybe some people want to play games with 1 hand?
2. In game communication - theoretically, you could run a video feed with people you are playing against or cooperatively. This would be awesome.
3. Skype/General communication. Also fantastic. It may be possible in the future (if not already) to communicate using a 3d camera. This would also be awesome

As of now, many of the features/usability are very limited. I would wait until a future firmware upgrade to get more functionality out this device. Hold off until more features are announced in an PS4 update before buying this because there aren't any features worth the investment yet.",positive

2089,"The game itself is great but to get the game to start and run is a nightmare. After installation all I got was that it was initializing. It was waiting for the Social club to give my computer the go ahead to run the game. It said I needed an internet connection and Explorer and Chrome and my email were always working fine. Anyways, After fighting this for a day I finally was able to put in my ""code"" by starting it in safe mode and then I had to run renderer.exe before I hit the Enter button and social club then asked for my code. I entered it and then I was able to play. The next time I played I started the game in the regular mode by using the renderer.exe trick. Unfortunately this does not always work and I find myself rebooting my computer till I can get the game to run. It is way too much of a pain and frankly I wonder where Rockstar is about all this. So many people are having this problem and they do not seem to be even be alive. They obviously are not reading the reviews or even reading their support emails. I got almost through the whole game and I will give up, so, I think I will stock this one in my old game box and move on. It is much too aggravating.",negative
2090,This is a fun little mouse to use and play around with. It fits great in your hand is comfortable to use. For the price having the adjustable DPI settings is awesome too. However around the 4 month mark the right click started to become hit and miss. Then by the 5th month stopped working all together. I took it apart out of curiosity and it looks like the mechanism for clicking just consists of a little nub soldered onto the main circuit board. So if this situation happens there really isn't a good way of rectifying it without potentially soldering a new nub in it's place and hoping for the best.,positive
2091,"Allow me to try and write a review based upon countless hours of play and analyzing the layout and structure.  First, this is a 4x, DEEP strategy title.  When first starting the game, leaving the help hints on and seriously reading them can help you better understand the workings.  The manual; I use only to look up a reference if something is confusing me (a.k.a. what Casus Belle was).  If you try to understand the game by reading it cover to cover you won't succeed.  It takes TIME to understand how the game manages the A.I - and YES, you WILL be using the A.I. in LOTS of cases.  The programmers wanted the gamer to feel like he's the leader/president/emperor of a galactic civilization, not a viceroy of a particular planet or solar system, therefor micro managing is definitely out of the question.  Looking back over your systems from time to time to fine tune is what will get you ahead, not working out each detail of each planet each turn.  Another part of the game - shipyard construction, can be very confusing if you don't know how each style of ship can be used.  The only way to decide is to play, create ships, and see what happens.  It's now second nature to me to create fleets and ship types, but it took many hours of understanding before I could finally do it `on the fly'.  This review may sound cryptic, but really the only way to understand the game is to dedicate and play, with an open mind and a willingness to use your imagination.  I personally believe that the A.I. could have been fine - tuned to balance ship and troop construction (It seems to build too much of a certain type).  The game is slow, but consuming.  I recommend it for anyone who loves deep strategy and has a willingness to learn.  It could have been better though.  Try to borrow or rent before you buy ^_^;;",positive

2093,"I like the concept of this game, and it does have some funny moments, but so far it's been a lot of long cut scenes and character dialog (text boxes) with action here and there. A bigger problem for me is the aiming mechanic - I've killed more walls and lamposts than zombies so far.  You might be able to master it after a lot of play, but I think many potential fans might quit early on in frustration. I suggest renting before buying this one.",positive
2094,"Harry Potter Game series are one of the games I'm looking forward to play and of course when PoA gam is out, I thought, what the heck, lets try it. And try I did.
Graphics are the well satisfactory but I like to turn around and see my enviroment more than it can offer me. Storyline is well along the line of the book and I don't have to tell you about that, or I would spoil you from reading the books.
The most let down of this game is that it is too damn short! It's shorter than what they have done to the movie itself, I don't have to tell you how many scenes they cut from that book *winks* There are only a few tasks and not much exploring in this one, as I would compare to the CoS game.

2096,"Only played this for about a week with friends and after that never played it again. Great idea but the gameplay mechanics are something to be desired. The sound effects for the guns in this game feels like you're shooting pellets instead of bullets. Animation is not that great as well and breaks immersion at times and some broken mechanics hinders gameplay.

The only reason I got this was because it was recommended by a friend and because it was only $5 during a promotion special. Recommend only if you are really bored and have nothing else better to do.",positive
2097,"I used to be heavily into adventure games. This was back in the heyday of the Commodore 64, when Infocom was king. Those people really knew how to tell a story and make puzzling fun. Then the graphics revolution came, and adventures became more about pretty pictures than actual adventuring. I got tired of paying $40-50 for games that looked lovely but bored me. DOOM came along, I got into first-person shooters and I never looked back.

 Well, I might have peeked once or twice. That's how this game caught my eye. It was reasonably priced compared to what I was used to seeing, and I remembered reading positive things about it.

 I've found that not much has changed.

 In this game, you play a lawyer named Kate Walker (an appropriate surname, since she does an ungodly amount of it) who has left her job to assist an elderly toymaker named Hans Voralberg in realizing his dream: that of reaching a legendary island called Syberia, where mammoths still roam. Basically you are his errand girl, making deliveries, doing maintenance, and retrieving items because he's too infirm to do it himself, and his robot companion Oscar is too timid and absolutely refuses to go out into the cold. Will Hans make it? Will you end up wanting to tell both Hans and Oscar to get lost and hightail it back to New York? I won't spoil it for you.

 (I hadn't played the first SYBERIA game, but that was okay because this sequel - or continuation, really - comes with a cinematic recap.)

 SYBERIA II is easily the most beautiful game I've played to date. The setting, a remote area of Russia, is a veritable winter wonderland, and the attention to detail is superb both in the graphics and sound. Snow slides off roofs to land with a satisfying ""floomph,"" wildlife roams or flies in the background, old structures creak. Kate makes footprints that disappear as more snow falls. It all contributes to an atmosphere so enveloping that I forgot that I was playing it in the middle of summer. There are also some amazing and truly cinematic linking sequences.

 The gameplay, however, is another story. The game is heavily scripted, which means you spend at least half the time talking to various characters. Repeatedly. In many cases, several times in a row. It's a very awkward and tedious way of moving the plot along. Why not at least have the conversation continue automatically rather than make the player keep clicking over and over again? As for the puzzles, they aren't so much difficult as simply obscure. At one point, you pick up a cleaning brush. (Why? Because it's there.) It's used to scrub away part of a painting in another room to find a clue. But why would anyone do that, or even think of doing it? There's no indication that the painting is relevant, unless you happen to run your cursor over the hotspot and see it change. That's just one example. A lot of the puzzles require you to pick up random items that seem to be of no significance, and which are very easily overlooked - and then do incongruous things with them. In one scene, you need to know how to operate a HAM radio, and the controls in the cockpit of a small plane. If you're not the game's creator, you're lost. Needless to say, I used an online walkthrough to get through most of it.

 When you finally do get to the end of the game, it's so sudden you'll feel like someone pressed stop on a tape. It's a huge disappointment after so much buildup, though the animation is, as always, stunning.

 It's a shame that so much obvious care went into the look and sound production and so little into playability. Perhaps SYBERIA II is better looked at as an interactive storybook than a game, though the story does need work. My recommendation is to wait for it to drop to a budget price, find a walkthrough, and enjoy the sights and sounds. Otherwise, it's frustrating.",positive

2101,"This game's fun factor is worth 5 stars but overall it deserves only 3. This game has all the minigames from the first with 14 extra ones thrown in.
MINIGAMES:
The minigames are were this game shines. Each one has specific controls and different elements. There are racing games,FPS games, side-scrolling adventures, bumper cars, trampolines, minigames, and other misc. games.
GRAPHICS:
Nothing spectacular. Rides and minigames are detailed but people look pretty bland.
GAMEPLAY:
The game's controls are good and it's easy to build rides and navigate through your data. Hire mechanics, janitors, and entertainers to do their jobs around your park. Play or ride whatever you build in your park. Talk to guests in your park to get their opinions and their needs.
ALL-IN-ALL:
Minigames aren't worth it if you have the first. Don't buy this if you don't enjoy games for younger audiences. But if you don't apply to either of the above get this game.",positive

I liked the variety of missions, from spec ops sneaking around to sniper missions to full-out battles to helicopter gunnery.  The effort to honor our brave men and women in uniform is also a nice plus.  It also gives a wide variety of difficulty settings to satisfy different types of gamers.

It was fun, but it was short.  I finished the single-player game in a few hours - surprising for a game like this.  Worth buying, but probably better to wait for a discount given how short the single-player version is.

Also, beware Amazon pre-orders and the promo codes they offer.  They only work with games you put in your cart later - they refused to honor the pre-order credit for me bc of the sequence of my pre-orders.  Amazon customer service was useless, as was their Executive Customer Service group.  Clearly their claim to be customer-centric is selectivly applied in real life.",positive

Much cheaper construction, cheaper plastic'y feel to the material, when I pick it up and put it down to move the mouse it makes a clanky cheap toy sound and the middle scroll wheel is basically non-functional after just a few months. I think Steelseries doesn't intend people to actually realistically use the middle mouse button because my Ikari Laser has the same problem, I use the middle mouse button frequently for games and for browsing (open and close tabs in browsers). Both my Ikari Laser and the Sensei RAW (Na'Vi edition) had this same problem. I'm going back to an ergonomic mouse because neutral designs just aren't for me I guess. The accuracy was amazing and it's a very consistent tracking experience for this mouse, nothing wrong with this sensor at all, but I'm going to Mionix Naos 7000 because I feel the build quality of Steelseries is on the decline for a while now.",negative
2106,"Pros (in my opinion -- some of my pros might be cons for others):

+ The high-point of the arch is toward the back of this large mouse -- this shape and size are well-suited for those with large hands who prefer a palm grip. Nevertheless, there was something about the size and/or shape that did not suit my grip (see Cons below).
+ Despite the lack of rubberized side-grips, the mouse was easy to pick up without slipping.
+ Lightweight (90g) and balanced -- no extra weight gimmicks.
+ No-nonsense style and design -- no LEDs (except on the underside to indicate the DPI setting), no software, and a tasteful understated logo.
+ Cable is flexible rubber rather braided and stiff.
+ Huano switches have a precise feel -- I like them better than the Omron switches found on most gaming mice.

Cons (in my opinion -- some of my cons might be pros for some people):

- Something about the shape and/or size was not right for me -- my hand felt cramped after using the mouse for only a few minutes.
- Ambidextrous design with side switches on both left and right. Because I am right-handed, I prefer an ergonomic right-hand design with side switches only on the left. However, the right-side switches did not get in the way as I thought they might.
- Surface of the top shell feels sticky after only a few minutes of use.
- The switch for changing DPI settings is inconveniently located on the underside of the mouse.
- Noisy scroll wheel with 16 notches instead of 24. This was the main deal-breaker for me. I much prefer a 24-notch scroll wheel that is virtually silent.",positive

2108,"I was really hoping to love this mouse. Unfortunately it has several problems. First, it feels cheap. Everything feels like thin plastic. It's hard to describe but it doesn't feel like it has good structure. Like if you dropped it, it might shatter into a million pieces. The grips are nothing special -- more a marketing gimmick than anything else.

But the biggest problem is that the laser is exposed. In a perfectly clean house, this might be fine. But I have pets, and I get pet hair stuck near the laser all the time requiring me to clean it out. To a lesser degree you can have the same issue with dust. For whatever reason, this mouse seems much more vulnerable to pet hair and dust than any other laser mouse I've used.

I was also hoping it would be more comfortable in my hand. If you use the ""claw"" mouse grip (look it up) this is not comfortable.",negative
2109,"The game itself is enjoyable.  However, I didn't like having to play against a timer, and there's no option to remove the time constraint, so I took one star off for that.

Another complaint I have is that the installer puts both the game and an online interface onto your computer.  You don't have a choice about whether or not to install the online component, and that application immediately begins trying to download other games onto your computer -- again, without any authorization from you.  I took another star off for this.  In fact, once I discovered I couldn't play the game without this unwanted additional component, I uninstalled the entire thing.

2110,"I only rented this game a couple of days ago, but so far I have gotten a nice picture of what it is. This is the very first RE(chronologically) in the series. It has all the stuff of the other RE versions, including the mansion and the lab. First the complaints, and then the pros.
***Complaints***
1. The ""partner"" system.
It's not that there is a partner that I don't like, its that they are overly used. I found myself switching between characters constantly. You can set your partner to stay put, or come with you as a team. You can tell them to help in battle, or do nothing, but that is all. Each has a special ability. Billy can push or lift things Rebecca can't. This is used WAY too much and almost all of the puzzles use the buddy system.
2. Excessive backtracking.
I know this is common in the RE games, but you only get 6 item slots, and many of the weapons take two slots to carry. Then you need 2 spaces for ammo, and your handgun, which leaves you one space for an item. There is no way to expand your storage, like insome other versions by picking up a utility pouch like in RE2. Problaby my biggest problem is that there is no item boxes, but to make up for that you can ""drop"" things. I have left all sorts of things all over the place. On the map,though, it tells you where you left them so backtracking is a little easier. But it was a bad move to ditch item boxes.
3. Too short
Even thought this game needs 2 Cd's, I have heard that there is overall less than 7 hours of gameplay if you know what you're doing.
4. More of the same.
This game is just like all the other RE ones, but prettier. The train is a new thing to try and break it up a little. You still go through the mansion, get to the lab, and beat the final virus-beast. I will get a lot of disagreements here, but I thing the next RE should be completely REdone with a different scenario, different characters, and something NEW. I feel that the existing RE scenario is just getting old and worn out.
***Complements***
1/2. Audio/video.
All I can is WOW. The graphics are awesome, maybe even a little better than the REmake. I didn't see any slowdown during the game at all. Everything looks real.
As for audio, the music is fitting and is placed well. SFX are very real and convincing. However, there is a lack of music in much of the game and SFX take over.
3. A nice deep story.
Even though the story is old and getting worn out, it is still nice. I'm saying that it is a good story, not that I like it.
4. A few good scares.
 There is certinaly a few good scenes where you will jump out of your seat, but a lot less than the REmake.
Well, the game barely broke even. A nice game, but not without its shortfalls. A solid rent,maybe two, but think twice about a buy. It looks awesome at first on the train, but I was dissapointed when I had to go through the mansion again, like in the other ones. Please think about buying this game before you do it.",positive

2119,"I've played this DJ game in on an arcade machine and I really like it. When I played the demo, I absolutely loved it. So I went ahead and purchased the full game. Here's the problem:

1). The demo had 5 or 6 songs (I'm sorry I don't remember the exact number because I deleted it after I got the full game.) and most of them are really nice English songs, including rock and rap I've never heard of. When I got the full game, I realized the VAST MAJORITY are Korean songs. The demo songs are still in the full game, but what I'm trying to say is the demo was definitely not a fair representation of the full game. I honestly I felt like I've been cheated into buying the full game. This is borderline fraud. They picked the only 5% English songs in the full game into the demo to suck you into buying the remaining 95% Korean songs. But if you like K-pop, this wouldn't be an issue for you then.

2). The difficulty level. The demo's difficulty was perfect. It was challenging but after a few tries, I really got the hang of it. The full game has a RIDICULOUS difficulty level. I'm a dedicated gamer myself for decades and I understand challenges make the game more fun, but let me explain why I hate this one. In most other music games, there's a health bar and every time you press the wrong note or off key, you lose a bit of health. But in this one, you can lose the entire bar 3 seconds into the song if you press the wrong note. Or even if you can keep up for a while, a small simple mistake can cause you to die and the song will stop right away when it's just about to get to the best part. I find that very irritating  and too harsh.

Other than the two problems I mentioned I above, the game was overall ok. The graphics are especially good. If you don't mind spend 5 hours trying to play through one Korean song, then I guess you will like this one.",neutral

2128,"I had purchased the Infinity 1.0 for my then 10 year old son, since he enjoyed Skylanders so much.  He did enjoy the Infinity games initially, but the playsets really didn't offer much for replay value.  Once you cleared something out, you couldn't go back and do it again without doing a new game.  So once we did the very short play time needed to complete a playset, it sat.  Unlike Skylanders, that gets played often.

I hesitated to do the Infinity 2.0 purchase because of the lack of play we had on the first one, but I had purchased the Xbox One version anyway more out of curiosity than anything, and then accidentally got sent this PS 4 version from the Vine program.  There's not any real noticeable difference between the two as far as graphics and such go, so other than gamer points, there's no advantage for us either way.

I have to say, graphics are considerably improved compared to the Infinity 1.0 on the Wii-U that we had.  So while this is not at the level of some of the first person shooters on the next gen consoles, it's definitely a step up from Infinity 1.0.

Gameplay seems to be mostly the same though, although the playsets are considerably more expanded.  But it's still the same basic play experience.  You're still breaking things, gathering the sparks, opening up upgrades.  The upgrade tree is considerably more advanced as well, with some granular control over what paths of skills you want to focus on.

We picked up a few extra figures and another two play sets, and while some of the controls are fine, I've had moments of real frustration when things are just wildly inconsistent.  The Iron Man figure, for example.  Upon the very first time playing him, no upgrades yet, I would randomly fly.  I had no idea what got this to happen, and most of the time then playing I was unable to altogether.  Then after the first upgrade, I saw some flight options that would have to wait for me to get enough experience and other prerequisite upgrades for, but that just begged the question about why I could fly at the beginning, but only sometimes.

And it's the little things like that which really detract from what may have been a more enjoyable game.

But the downside is that they're competing against things like Skylanders, which really is, for my son and I, a better system.  The graphics are better, the animations are better, and there's more playability there than with the Infinity system.

So while it's neat to be able to play as characters he likes from things like Guardians of the Galaxy, or Marvel comics, the novelty wears off quickly with the repetitiveness of the gameplay and the inconsistent controls.",positive

2133,"First of all, I've played the original several times, and it's one of my favorite RPG's. I'm a sucker for remakes, namely so that I can relive the experience in a whole new perspective, and when done right remakes can even surpass the original. With that said this remake is definately above average, and should be a model for other remakes.

But as much as I wanted to give this game a 5-star rating, there were some serious flaws that I could not overlook.

1) The infamous glitch. When you search for a town or dungeon or item on the map, sometimes the screen ends up getting cut off and you are unable to proceed forward unless you enter a town or dungeon. This in itself isn't so much a major flaw as it is annoying, but when you are hanging onto a thread of your life and have just traveled several paces, only to realize there is a (well, I guess you'd call it a blue box of some sort that prevents you from moving forward), the last thing I want to do is try to run back the way I came and see if I can avoid potentially powerful monsters only to find the town I just passed and make the glitch go away. There's also issues with the screen shaking from time to time, especially during cut scenes.

2) Lacking voice dialog in the FMV sequences. I could forgive the original PS and even the early days of the PS2 for leaving off voice talent. But this late into the PS2's life? Don't get me wrong, I don't mind reading. In fact, part of the joy in Wild Arms comes from reading the various books and speaking with the locals to gain knowledge on Filgaia's past. However, the actual movie sequences should have been voiced. In fact, the event file key you find in the outfield allows you to play back the movies you've seen, except this time they are without any dialog (scripted or spoken). This would lead one to believe it was voice was intended, but never included.

3) Battles are very tedious and overlong, and building your characters (with the exception of Jack and Emma) just was not as fun as the original. Part of the fame of the original was getting sucked into battle just to see it unfold in 3-D, which was quite a treat back in the days when 2-D was the rule outside of battle.

4) Cecilia know longer has the ability to use magic outside of battle. This requires that you now use your hard-earned items for healing, and you are not able to use magic to exit dungeons. In addition to that, you no longer have the advanced magic that was part of the original. All of your magic can be discovered in the first town (whether you have a crest graph or not), so there's no mystery as to what you will get later on. Group enemy attacks are now done through a Guardian, which is fine, except you don't find this guardian until late into the game and you are forced to watch the Guardian movie each time you use the attack in battle, until you find the key that allows you to turn the Guardian movies off.

5) I can understand that each character has a special weapon/ability, so naturally they removed the weapon shops. But what about an armor shop to help increase your defense?

6) You find your secondary characters so late into the game they're almost worthless (not that any of the secondary characters were worth the hassle to begin with). They could have had access to these characters spaced out better throughout the game. At least Jane has the Follow Me command to ensure you're first in battle, and Emma's Great Booster will really pump up Rudy and Jack's attacks.

Don't get me wrong. There's still potential here and this game is worthy of the remake it became. New puzzles, new locations, advanced storylines, and some of the best movie sequences I've seen in a long time, just to name a few, make this game worth the time. I just wished they'd waited and worked out some of the issues before releasing this game.

Updated 12/4/08: When I first played this game, I reviewed it right after completing it without going back to the original, so my fond memories of the original did effect my overall scoring with this game. I still think this game had some hurting flaws (especially considering the amount of glitches present in the game), but the game itself was very impressive. The story was much more detailed, the characters were well developed and deeply involved, and the layout was very well detailed. Some of the gameplay was certainly awkward (not being able to use magic outside of battle and not being able to escape from dungeons, no higher magic, no upgraded weapons or armor, not having to fight to learn your new sword techniques, missing dungeons and villains from the original game), but other aspects of the game were well improved (acquiring multiple characters, being able to swap them in and out of battle at your convenience, the ability to walk to avoid certain traps or plummeting over an edge, each character having their own set ability and/or fighting style. The music was great, although I still wished for voice dialog. Overall, my opinion of the game has certainly increased, and glitches aside (as this has more to do with the developers than it does the game), I give this 4 stars.",neutral

Although there are plenty of ways to work around these issues, I found the version of Android on the Shield Portable to be much easier to deal with, and not fight you at every turn.

2139,"Playing F1 2013 I was struck by several contradicting qualities.  The graphics are quite outstanding for 360.  The racing model is great.  Like other Codemasters racing games, the AI of computer drivers is very satisfying.  There are lots of modes and content.

At the same time, the difficulty and learning curve is unreal.  It is a bit like Dark Souls in that regard.  Even playing on the lowest settings took me quite a while to finish races in the upper half of the cars.  Also, there is a ton of unexplained things in the game.  These are things that F1 fans would know, but if you are a layman or have no experience with F1 it is virtually impossible to figure out.
*Prime vs option tires.
*""The guy behind you is running full revs""
*Some cars are much faster than others, but the game doesn't give you car stats like in Gran Turismo or Forza

What made it even tougher to figure out is that I got this game free with the ""games with gold"" promotion, so no user manual.

I posted on numerous forums questions on these and other topics.  After about 30 hours of racing I am now mid-pack with Red Bull, who is supposedly the fastest car.  This is on the second lowest difficulty setting.

Probably a 5 star game if are an F1 fan, but virtually impossible to a newbie, especially if you don't have tons of patience.  I can't say it has been much fun.  But I did learn a lot about the F1 sport.  So it felt like watching a good documentary.

Lastly, I picked up an official MS wireless force feedback wheel (cheap on Craiglist) and it works pretty well.  If you go on youtube and search for AOR fisi you will see some incredible league racing.  Some of the world class racers like TRL limitless do fine with a standard pad.  So I don't think the control method will determine your success.  It's just a matter of logging tons and tons and tons of hours of practice in this game.  Learn every inch of every track, and perhaps give up other videogames for a while and focus.",negative
2140,It an alright game :(,positive
2141,"By now it goes without saying that GR2 bears little resemblance to the original incarnation of the game, or even the console ports of it.  It's really less a sequel and more a Rainbow 6: Black Arrow, for Ghost Recon. Which is to say: a game that's acceptably faithful to the original but clearly engineered for consoles rather than the PC.

The core design isn't really the problem with this game as, for the most part, it plays pretty well and still manages to convey an authentic GR experience; even if it does lack some of the finer points. Unfortunately as with Black Arrow, your squadmates are pretty much fixed so there's no element of strategy to the pre-game aside from picking your own loadout. Multiplayer options abound and I think the only thing I found lacking about the off-campaign missions was the inability to run a Firefight with a squad to back you up or to use something besides US weaponry in general. It seems the only place you get to play with the foreign hardware is in the true multiplayer modes.

While I was initially quite disappointed to see how stripped down GR2 ended up being in general, it works, so I can't objectively count that against it. With that aside there ultimately ends up being a good number of other things beneath the surface that serve to hinder overall enjoyment.

If you've played the original GR you can vouch for the fact that your squadmates were often the first to pick out and gun down enemies, more often than not before you even knew they were there. It seems that your new squad of ghosts are a bit on the nearsighted side as they generally end up doing exactly the opposite. Compound this with some occasionally schitzophrenic pathfinding and you have a recipe for annoyance. Teammates who randomly run across your field of fire, take cover behind something that occludes their shot of an enemy, or... just not shooting at them at all. The AI commands are pretty limited and none seem to be especially useful aside from ""surpress"". Telling your mates to flank often just sends them off wandering in a random direction and ""hold"" seems to wear off by itself and send your little buddies hurrying off to find where ever you've gone in their absence.  As a side note, ""hold fire"" strikes me as almost entirely useless due to the fact that any element of stealth within the game is all but broken and works on only the most basic of levels.

Your opposition on the other hand seems to have no problem finding cover, falling back and repositioning to get the drop on you. The enemy AI isn't brilliant, but its enough to be challenging without a few of the game's more annoying mechanics backing them up. First of these is the fact that enemies will indeed spawn out of thin air. You think you've cleared the area behind you on the way to an objective? Well, you probably did, but now there is inexplicably a hail of bullets comming from that direction.  Now make no mistake, the original GR -did- do things like this on occasion but in GR2 it seems to be much more of a staple, or thorn, to the point that its readilly noticable and becomes expected that you can pretty much never safely turn your back. Somewhat in line with this is the fact that when enemies -do- start crawling out of the woodwork (and I don't mean on missions where they're supposed to) they tend to do so in mass numbers.  Even in its stripped down form, GR is still not well suited as a by-the-numbers shooter; especially when you have half-braindead AI backing you up.

The mission design is superficially pretty well-varied but alot of the missions end up boiling down to, ""go here and protect this from 100 enemies that are swarming out of the treeline"".  The new ""Defend"" mode is built around this idea but there are also a few others which place you in the same position. Some of the maps are more linear than others, though once you take into account the randomly spawn-reinforced opposition you may come to appreciate them more than the wider open ones where you're more or less a sitting duck waiting to be ambushed from an area you just cleared out.

The only real ""enhancement"" to the game, also exacerbates one of its most annoying quirks.  The M29 (and that other one, I can't think of right now) are pretty neat little toys that can make it feel more like you're playing Kill.switch than Ghost Recon 2, but they're not without their downside.  Though it seems to be more of an issue when using 3rd person, the problem can also crop up in 1st person as well.  Your launched grenades (this does apply to any underslung grenade launcher, its just more problematic with the unique aiming of the IWS rifles) seem to have a really large collision box.  This basically means that its really easy to unwittingly grenade yourself in the face when behind cover.

I think that's enough ranting so in summary: GR2 could've ultimately been a solid, if stripped down and somewhat halfhearted ""sequel"", but there's alot of little things counting against it that could be grounds for a good ammount of frustration.",negative
2142,"Her Interactive has redeemed itself with this game. On the positive side, I enjoyed Bess' pluck, determination, and ingenuity -- and the fact that she had the opportunity to infilitrate a secret society (like Skull & Bones.) The game was well structured and interesting....and the graphics were superb. This game also drew from of the clever affects of previous games -- including overhearing private conversations from hidden passages/behind walls and being able to acquire info by spying on others from peep holes (think Blackmoor and Message in Haunted Mansion).

However, I found many of the puzzles in this game rather tedious (especially the marbles and wasps) which relied more on hand-eye coordination and mouse functionality than wit. I would have also appeciated more character development/interaction...and the plot, while interesting and well structured, still fell a bit flat. Would have been nice to have seen more of New Orleans as well.

It trys too hard to be GTAIV, but lacks nearly everything that made that game great.

The targeting system and guns are far more entertaining to use in this game than they were in GTAIV. You gain ""perks"" by completing certain task, like getting 10 headshots or 10 melee kills.. which is awesome.

Had it been designed for the 360/PS3 exclusively the graphics would probably have a lot more detail than they already do; it feels like it has a case of Xbox1/Wii-itis. It's good fan service but as a game seems more like a $39.99 title. ""Travellers Tales"" style production values mixed with Virtua Tennis 3 controls; which isn't a bad thing just a bit generic. Certain courses seem to have either slowdown or a slower framerate, not sure which but it's a bit annoying.

2155,"Although this is a newer version of Mario Party, I was a bit disappointed by this game. I had previously bought Mario Party DS to play on my 3DS and was excited because it reminded me of classic Mario Party on N64 and Gamecube: longer, updated versions of the classic mini games--essentially same concept but Is;and Tour is almost nothing like that. For one, there are fewer options to play in party mode or at least, it sure seems that way as the games are really short. A lot of the games are more about boosters and spots that let you move again on boards that are already less than half of the size of older party mode versions. Even when you are set back by a baddie in the level, you can easily get back to where you were and most likely avoid the bad guy on the next go around. Concerning mini games, the majority of them are similar to Mario Party DS but in a different theme which I found odd. Levels are more like a game of hopscotch and developers even rid stars and items like star pipes which jumbles the concept of Mario Party. Semi appealing and also similar to the DS version is the Mario Tower where you race to the top of Bowser's castle by beating his minions--this time in bubble form (so frightening--in mini games. For each level of the tower, you have 2 options for mini games. You do not restart from the bottom if you lose and in fact have the option to select the other option if wanted. To sass it up, there are quirks in the game that could even remove at least one of the bubble minions, increasing your odds in defeating the level and in certain levels, Bowser sees your improvement and spins a wheel which decides your fate. Funny enough, one of the options is to go to the top but if this space is landed on, Bowser changes his mind, wondering why the space was on as he thought it was removed. The tower unlocks SPOILER Bowser Jr on 1st completion which makes Bowser angrier and thus, it gets harder to defeat the tower. Overall, the game is average. I would have preferred longer games, or at least more options to play. A neat idea if it was a game board inside of a game board where you would have the option to stop and shop to upgrade boosters like in the level in order to bring back stars and items that help you on the board. I am unsure if I would recommend this game as my opinion is still that Mario Party DS is better if you are looking for the classic Mario Party (looking for stars, similar mini games, boss interruptions, etc.) and this game is not that.",neutral
2156,"If you have ever played any of the Grand Theft Auto games on the Playstation 2, I'd probably recommend skipping this game.  It's plays exactly like the GTA series, but without the ""Mature (M)"" rating.  They've toned it down to get a ""Teen (T)"" rating, although it could've easily been spiced up for the Mature audience.

The gameplay is near identical to the GTA series; you have core missions that must be accomplished to ""beat"" the game, plus there are tons of little side missions that can be accomplished if you choose.  Also like GTA, there are hidden items that you find as you travel through the world; this is one aspect of the game that somewhat annoys me, inorder to find everyone of these little items you would basically need to buy the Game Guide, or have a walk-through tell you where each and every one is.  Too much hassle for me.

So, if you haven't play a GTA game yet, or you thought they were to violent for your kids (which they are), this is a great alternative, however it does have some violence, language and suggestive situations in it so pay attention to the ""Teen"" rating.  If you've played, and liked the GTA series, save your money, you'll most likely be bored with this title very quickly.",neutral
2157,"The game itself is good, if just a bit too short. If you played the first Bioshock, this is more of the same, although I didn't enjoy the story nearly as much.

My one big gripe concerns the use of Windows Live. I have no problems with games requiring online activation. But once you go online and enter your serial number, that should be the end of it. This game required me to create a Windows Live account, which I do not want....and since I only play single player games, I shouldn't have to do so. Then I had to wait 20 minutes to receive my ""activation email"".  Then I was required to sit and wait for over an hour while updates downloaded and installed (2 or 3 different updates, which then required reboots). It was therefore almost 2 hours from the time I sat down to install, until I could actually play the game. And it was only after reading online that I found out how to create a ""local"" account so that I don't have to log in every time I play. Absolutely ridiculous and a very BAD user experience. I will not buy any games requiring Windows Live accounts in the future.",negative
2158,"When Outdoor Retreat was released, I was thrilled with the price point, so let's talk about that first.

Past incarnations of The Sims have given players two options to expand their game: Expansion Packs and ""Stuff"" Packs, which included objects and sometimes clothing or other items that would enhance the game. Stuff Packs occasionally added some interactions to the game, but their focus was on the objects and clothing (and still is). Expansion Packs cost $30-$40 and Stuff Packs cost $20 (for The Sims 3).

Breaking that standard, Outdoor Retreat set me back a mere $20 and provided me with a remarkable amount of content, particularly when compared to what I had come to expect from Sims 3 Stuff Packs (to the point that I'd stopped purchasing them, as they didn't seem to be worth the money to me by the time the game was outdated).

If you don't read anything beyond this point, let me assure you that the price point makes this pack an incredible value for only $20. Anyone who loves The Sims 4 should enjoy this pack for the price thanks to what it adds to the base.

With that said, let's get into what this game pack adds to the base game, and establish that it was the first pack of this type to be released for The Sims 4.

First, the game added what one would expect: Tons of new objects focused around a singular theme (in this case, outdoor activities), as well as CAS (create-a-sim) content such as hats and clothing. New objects include tents, blankets for cloudgazing and stargazing (new interactions, see below), and outdoor games (such as the horseshoes game). New clothing includes outdoor, hiking-type of gear and outfits, along with a bear costume that will appear in the woods around Granite falls.

I love the objects that came with this game, particularly for when I'm struggling early in a Legacy Challenge. The coolers allow my sim to have access to quick meals as well as somewhere to sit down to eat them, and this is definitely a bonus. Inexpensive beds also came with this game, as well as tents. Each has its own rating for how well your sim will sleep on the bed or in the tent, and this will expand or reduce the amount of sleep time that the sim needs. All of this has been useful for me.

The outfits are cute and I use them regularly with my sims, particularly if I plan on sending them on vacation to Granite Falls.

In addition to the objects and the new outfits for your sims, the game pack comes with the world of Granite Falls. This isn't a new world like those which came with the game, as your sims can only access it to go on a limited vacation and won't be able to live there. It comes complete with cabins for your sim to rent, or campsites if they would prefer to put down a tent.

I don't use this part of the game pack all that often, though I will readily admit that I should use it more. I'm one of those players who finds it difficult to balance everything in the game an I rarely want to pay that much for my sims to go on vacation to Granite Falls. This leads me, however, to the features of the game pack that I really love.

For the low price point of this game pack, I didn't expect the additions to game play, but this is what makes it a game pack and not a stuff pack. Additions include a new skill (herbalism), new collectibles (fish, plants, and INSECTS), a new Aspiration (Outdoor Enthusiast) and a new trait (""squeamish""), along with a new type of party (weenie roast), and new recipes.

This is what got me excited. I love new traits added to the game to work with and play with, and I find herbalism quite a challenge because of the variety of components involved in it and the mysterious nature of the plants required for herbalism. For me, this, was where real game expansion became possible, but again, for an irresistible price point.

For me, the best elements of the game are its social elements (though I'm not great at playing them, I'll admit!) and what I really love is the Weenie Roasts, along with the new foods to expand your cook's repertoire. The only issue I found with this is that Sims using the fire pit do tend to catch on fire, making the Weenie Roasts a disaster if you're not able to get it under control. As of this writing the game pack is over a year old and this does not appear to have been fixed.

All in all, I highly recommend this pack for The Sims 4!",positive
2159,"To display here how much I have enjoyed the Creed series to date would be impossible.  The franchise took a chance and ran with it, I remember how new it felt, then Ezio came into the picture, and blew everything out the water, visually, and narratively.  Altair was a engaging character, and Ezio was a fun loving personality and a half, which is probably why they centered 3 games around him.  Now we are at Creed 3, and just what happened?  Like everyone else, I got frustrated at chases in previous itinerations, especially getting a little too close to a wall, and our hero would try to run up it, ok, what did I expect?  Here in 3, I could be feet away from a wall and I teleport just to attempt to run up, or attempting to get to an objective in a time limit, mistakenly jumping on a rail/ledge, and he won't get down, no matter how many times I slam the B button, or even try to jump off in one direction, and just jumps to another rail that I cant get down from. really?  This has happened more times than I can count.

Some of the mechanics have failed more times than I can describe as well.  Examples include defense, blocking and countering, typically while in the Animus (not as Desmond) you have indicators that let you know an enemy is about to strike, sometimes they just don't feel like showing up.  I don't have a problem using my counter button without them, but they are helpful, especially when you have a very large crowd of enemies surrounding or crowding you, and you can't tell who is going to strike from where with all the movement.  Some of the mission challenges are perplexingly painful as well, without giving any story away, a challenge that stood out was to ""Not take damage from firing lines"", no problem, so for the first volley, I managed to grab a human shield, almost immediately a second line prepped to fire, I attempted to grab another shield, and I couldn't do it, the option showed on the screen, but Connor just would not do it, at all.  Even after retying several times, it just wouldn't execute the contextual movement.  After getting frustrated, I decided to bypass that area, and found another way to the target, which worked out very well until I actually killed my target, right when I got my mark, a random enemy managed to shoot me with his musket before the cutscene, failing the optional objective, not a firing line, but a random enemy I couldn't see, wow.

When causing a stir in the towns, some of these can be frustratingly bad as well, especially if trying to escape.  Somehow, despite the amazingly slow reload rates of a musket, when climbing a building to run off, they turn into semi-automatic weapons, and fire repeatedly, most times they miss, but there have been times when I would be hit numerous times in a row only to fall and see...2 people standing there with muskets.  To capitalize on this, I have had areas that were clear when I had no noteriety whatsoever, then Reds would start chasing me unprovoked, which, more times than I care to admit, when I took care of the few coming for me, another group shows up, then another, another, another.  I stood my ground with no where to run for upwards of 30 minutes, but they kept bringing in more for the fight.  I finally gave up and just allowed myself to die.

Visually, there are typical pop-ins, clipping, etc, as with any other open world style game, but for the most part, the game is beautiful.  The setting is gorgeous, lush forests, populated towns, with lots of color.  Aside from the occasional issue, I can never mark the Creed series for having ugly, or drab settings.

Story wise, it's a bit thin, Connor has the personality of a brick, and is very hard to connect with his struggle.  But don't let that sway you at all, he is a good character, but you will be missing Ezio fast.

To sum up, everything is here for Die-hard Assassin's Creed veterans, but you may feel quite underwhelmed.  If you are new to the series, you won't be lost, this is a whole new time period with all new characters, but you may be thrown off by Desmond's side by not knowing the events leading up to 3, but the opening cinematic, or looking online will catch you up real quick, but as a new player, check out Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations first, which you can get for beans now, or pick up the Ezio Trilogy Box Set.",negative

The fun is there if you are patient enough to stick around for it, but I can't help notice that this version just feels kind of plain or unfinished... I can't describe it exactly. It has no proper multiplayer and the small problems at the core of the gameplay really hinder this from being as fun as it was on the Console versions. Unless you really want Modnation Racers on the go, I'd probably skip this one unless you can find it for under $18. I paid $19 on launch day so it didn't hurt as much.

Cons. ok here we start getting into the disappointing stuff.

- Control scheme is awful. not the actuall button. they can be remapped. but the ninjutsus controls. awful. really bad. and very hard to excute in some situations. what happened to the two buttons down, two buttons up mapping. that was the best ninjutsu mapping

- 1 NINJTSU PER CHARACTER? WHY? HOW IS THAT A GOOD IDEA? JUST 1. AND 1 ULTIMATE JUTSU. GAME TURNS TOO REPETITIVE DURING A GAME

- Some jutsus and Ultimate jutsus aren't as good as they were shown in the show. some of them are completely not what were shown in the show. but some other jutsu or something made especially for the game. why did they do that? no idea

- fake open-world. what do I mean by that?. well. its a corridor walker. not much space. not open. shame.

- the camera is a Resident Evil static camera. does not let you look at the world from your POV. I hate this a lot.

- you only have one Ultimate Jutsu per character. some characters have multiple versions which each have a different Ultimate. but as I recall some PS2 naruto games. when you go into awakenings. you get a different Jutsu. or when your health drops below 30%. none of that is here

- lacks beat 'em up style fights like the ones in ultimate ninja 4,5. there are no gangs and bandits you find around. the world is too empty. its a corridor walker anyway. shame

- Substitutions have their own gauge. this destroys PVP. its really not good. your gauge expired. tough luck. you must get an item for it to heal back or just wait until some miracle happens. it should be the same as CHAKRA meter.

- Ultimate Jutsu execution is PATHETIC. absolutely pathetic. all you need to do to succeed is to hit the enemy with your charge up attack. there is no Get the Most correct buttons type of thing of ultimate ninja games and PS2 games. it makes it not challenging and freakin pathetic. I don't like this.

-since not all characters have awakenings. most if not all awakenings are unfair. it doesn't last long. but you're pretty much invincible in some awakenings. not all of them. like Deidara. you can just spam his ranged attacks. the opponent will just try to dodge them. thats all he can do.

- Some characters should have been included . that were on the show in that timeline. yet they're not there.

- You can't change character jutsus from other ones that have been on the show. I don't know why many are not included. and why don't we have the option at all.

- Even though I said graphics are awesome. they're. except the character models. so many lines are screwed up. no aliasing on them at all. they just look so jagged and not-alive. plasticky

- And this is my BIGGEST  complain of them all. NO 2D FIGHTING MODE. WHY NOT? 3D arena's simply don't work well. why? its just messed up. sometimes your jutsu won't hit for no reason. some of them and some ultimate jutsus don't even go the direction of the enemy even if he stands still. what is he supposed to walk into them intentionally? dumb

- The story mode. is very basic. its basically only fights. ONLY THE FIGHTS. in the show. there are side missions. but pathetic ones that I don't even want to do them. I did a lot of side missions in older naruto games. they were just interesting. new areas. felt important. but this doesn't. and even the main chapters. all you do is run from area to area. and get into a fight. really? What happened to getting information. or something else. or all the stuff that happened on the show. you know getting intel and few missions that they did. NOTHING. the Story is just the MAJOR fights from the show. not even all of them. PATHETIC. and SHORT. might as well not play it. well you'll need to unlock characters so you have no choice. NOTHING FEELS CONNECTED. shame on you CC2 and bandai.

- Not all DLC is included. Goku Naruto, Hokage Naruto, and Hello Kitty sakura are not included. Why? isn't this the ""Full Burst"" Edition. damn

- Not enough RPG elements. the world doesn't tell much of the story. nothing to explore. Nothing I want to explore. camera does not move. so you see the same side every time. and its a narrow corridor. everywhere is a corridor.

- Online is screwed with people that use the same character. 99% of everyone online uses Minato. why? because hes glitched. he has that 1 attack where it is supposed to be blockable. but its not from a certain distance. you can't do much about it. they just spam it. and his awakening is instantaneous. hes invincible. and even if they don't use it. well. you're screwed because online is about who has more substitution bars. if you don't have them you're done.

- Items are nearly useless in battle. considering we each have 2 health bars. the ones that do damage. don't really matter at all. and the ones that give you perk or the ones that give him some negative thing. lasts shortly and it doesn't impact the battle much

- Only 3 Game modes. story (which is a sorry excuse for one). PVP (which is just ok) and multiplayer PVP (yeah. good luck dealing with players that take advantage of glitches).

I've been watching the show for 8 years now. Played a lot of naruto games on my PS2. this is my first PS3 game. I've played the other ones a little on the PS3. and I was expecting this to be a mediocre experience. and its very disappointing and incomparable to the PS2  counterparts. casuals will like this. serious Naruto fans. not so much.

and by the way. the ""extra chapter"" this version has. is 1 extra fight. yeah. just 1 fight. and you access it from the timeline menu. you don't actually go to its place. so its not worth getting this edition all that much.",negative
2162,"Frontline was designed using an older style of graphics. It doesn't measure up to some of the newer more advanced games out there today and it certainly doesn't take advantage of the XBOX's capabilities. That being said, the game isn't bad.

The reduced price makes it affordable enough to buy despite its shortcomings so you won't regret blowing $50 big ones on it.",neutral

2166,"I am not a picky gamer cuz I enjoyed most games with hammered reviews.
However this game really disappointed me and not worth $39.99 at the time.
Story line is plain but not too bad, don't feel any connection between characters.

Pros:
1. Graphic is awesome and in details.
2. Cutscenes integrated seamlessly with gameplay.

Cons:
1. Weird fighting system with unnecessary complications. Many times an accident happened you have to follow hints to press buttons which is not in your control and hard sometimes yet boring as hell. Shooting part is merely okay.
2. No freedom to walk around and can't even walk fast in most scenes. You don't have chance to walk on streets and look around, everything is restricted into story line.
3. No strategy is needed to complete tasks, absolutely no brainers.
4. Game is not long enough. Many chapters are only custscenes and gameplay is probably only half of total time.
5. No side tasks.",negative
2167,The figure and I idea behind the game is pretty cool but its way too difficult for an average child. Which takes all the fun out of it. Stick with Skylanders instead. 100% more fun.,positive
2168,"Don't give in to current price trends (as of December 14th, 2015). The game may have limited to no stock across major retailers in the US, but Amazon does plan on restocking in a week's time! Also, this game isn't worth more than $60.",positive
2169,"Just got around to seeing what the hype is on this game.  The visuals are stunning!  I had a nice time just roaming around and watching the scenery.  The rides from city to city on the horses were alot of fun for me, but the Middle-Eastern names and storyline made it a little difficult for me to keep up with at first.  I really had to pay attention to know who was who.  Some subtitles would've been very helpful.  (Did I somehow miss those, because I sure did search)

Even though there are places to hide from guards, I never saw a reason to do it.  It was easy to kill them in large numbers without dying.  I think the game is too easy in that regard.  I had a few odd glitches also.  Sometimes Altair would freeze in battle while everyone else continuted on.  And there were times when horses would sink halfway into the ground when I approached them, or their hind legs would be stuck out horizontally.  If I sliced at them, they would run off with their legs still stuck in a horizontal position.  Very very odd.

This has to be the most redundant game I've ever played.  The first few missions are great, but it never changes.  You go to a city, you climb large towers to open up the area, you pickpocket, you eavesdrop, you look for flags, you get chased by guards, you go to the bureau to get orders, and you kill a major target.  The same thing. Over and over again.  It never gets any harder and it never changes.

I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this game.  Someone else who got bored with it and couldn't finish it gave it to me.  I'm more than willing to pass it on to someone else for free as well.",negative

2171,"Keyboard is nice and solid.  But the keycaps feel cheap. I pulled one off to change the keys to the red gaming keys and it totally stripped the center out of the cherry-blue switch.  I was able to fix it and get it working again on my own.  But that should not have happened as I used the tool correctly.  Other than that, it's a nice small keyboard good for gaming and typing.",positive
2172,"Decidedly average platformer. This game is not good and is demonstrably a product of yesteryear. While the Sly gameplay is a lot of fun, combining generic 3d platforming with a stealth twist, the game becomes unfun when you're forced to play as sly's friends. Games mario galaxy have brought 3d platforming into the next decade while games like sly cling to old unpleasant mechanics and designs.

Also, the humor is really, really lame. I like that they try to give the game some personality, but it all feels very fake and lame. The jokes hit you like overstuffed pillows and you're left wondering if you were supposed to laugh.",positive
2173,"These three games are presented more or less acurately, but the graphic quality is much poorer than I expected.

2174,The game is fun but I can never get the lighting just right in the game. Not sure if it is the crappy camera that the 360 has or the game.

I am sure you will have fun watching the movies playback as well.,negative

2176,"There's no cutscene skip. One would think that Square Enix would include this feature since this game is over 10 years old and the large majority of people buying this game have already played it. Not only that, but there are scenes that can't advance more quickly by mashing X that you otherwise could have in the original version. The first clear example being during a scene at the entrance to Kilika Temple (within the first few hours of the game) with the Luca Goers.

Why is this a big deal for me? It's a JRPG. The story in X is pretty good, but it's not stellar. I mostly play games for their battle system, not the story. It would be nice to be able to skip at least some of the cutscenes, even just the ones that are FMVs. Plus, I would have liked to attempt to speed run the game, but with cutscenes, the best times on the PS2 barely cut 11 hours. An extra hour is added on this version for seemingly longer load times and previously partially-skippable scenes. Such a shame.

Well, now that I'm off my soapbox, I'll say some positive things. The updated graphics look really great, and it's good that they added in the international version, which was previously unavailable in the US. I'm excited to try the new sphere grid.

If I ever get around to playing X-2, I'll add on to this review.",positive
2177,"Finished Resident Evil 5. It looks amazing. The African environments are stunning to see. I applaud the game creators for making levels that are more than dark cramped spaces. This game adds Sheva as a co-op partner. She aids you when you need it without distracting from gameplay. The control schemes stink. You are limited to a small number of choices for controller configurations without opportunity to customize them. Lastly, zombies use motorcycles & guns?! I wish Capcom had spent more time coming up with something that fit the survival horror genre better. If you can adjust to the odd controller schemes and can forgive the genre bending design decisions, then you will like this one.",positive

2179,"I couldn't wait to play this game so much I bought xbox 360 version before the ps4 version released.xbox holds a much more fun game even though they copied and pasted 90% of the game with glitches..I found the match creator and match options far more rewarding on 360.ps4 has the most beautiful arenas I have ever seen..but the characters look better on xbox..shawn micheals eyes look white blue and is creepy,summer rae has the worst mouth ever in fandangos entrance especially..simply put visually the arenas are the best part..they didn't focus on accuracy in characters like ufc ps4's only sports fighting game.as a fan I was hopefull that this would crush it..sadly the comentary is not new or fluid and while they have new lines its nowhere near what they promissed!! The pace is very slow often to slow with no option to speed up..the chain grappeling is nice but last gens predator 2.0 technology was more fluid. I often felt like I was stumbling around the ring instead of wrestling..the entrances and cutsceens all struggle from frame rate issues when it tends to lag and feel super old school computer generated..match types are hardly an option if you buy the game or already have you'll see exactly what im talking about..as for music no john cena & wiz exclusive included which was lame..music cant even be change to another song so get used to dealing with it unlike the xbox 360 version of the same game..last gen gives you so much more of a video game and sadly more realistic faces on some superstars..more creative options and feedom all around..ps4's version of the game feels instantly constricted and dictated to be one way to play and nothing more..even superstar threads is gone and replaced with a new system that makes you create a new superstar in order to edit any detail and save it in one of the 25 created wrestler slots...so if you want to edit the full roster sorry no can do..the game on ps4 does have new animations like...steel step irish whips..crawl pin..pull back to your feet using the ropes..and charged finisher which links a wakeup taunt and finisher automatically like in the shows.the lighting on ps4 is amazing and 100% accurrate durring all entrances in all arenas! The titles are super shiny and you really feel like its a real treat on ps4 especially during undertakers entrance or the rocks even triple H and I cant stand him.

overall : xbox 360 is the fun action packed version with nice surprises along the way like the exclusive creative suites and returning enviornmental hotspot for steel cage matches when you drag you opponent to the ropes and press LS down+A and NXT arrival arena which is nice to have even though its similar to the NXT arena..its just more arcade type fun!

PS4: provides stunning arenas with 100%accuracy,the best lighting in any game yet,GREAT new animation like steel post,steel steps,finishers,crawling motions,and more..in addition to a rediculous sense of realism both good and bad.

2181,"I had the logitech mx 1000, the mX rev, G518, G5, G9, and G9x. I personally like the G9 & G9x. But they are not wireless, so they couldn't work with my current setup. So I skipped G700 and got this one instead. a friend used to have the G7, but the battery life was terrible. Well so far G700s is not bad at all. Took me a good hour to get use to the keys, and experienced zero lag. Nice to be able to plug the charging cable to any usb charger (used my phones charger). So I can save one USB for something else. Therefore even when the mouse is ""plugin"" it's working as a wireless device.

The grip is not G9, so it's different. Had to adjust a little for head-shots. But the buttons are perfect, very fast and responsive.
The best part was the fact it came with Eneloop battery.  I got enough for backups, in case of emergency :-p.  I mean at almost $2 a pop they better be the best there ever was right!?

update 5/17/14: Had to put it down to 3 stars, really wanted to like this mouse, but the sudden slow downs are really killing my gaming. 99% of time it works perfectly, but once in a while it would suddenly act weird lag for a few second, tried to change the refresh rate etc, does not help.

2185,"I found this game to be an enjoyable Half-Life knockoff.  The most notable thing about the game is that it seems to have every weapon ever used in an FPS and you get to carry all of them at the same time.  LOL!

Graphics were decent, but contrast seemed low compared to most other games.  Adjusting it only seemed to make everything dark.

Also included in this game are bio-enhancements that give the player the ability to see through walls, slow down time, shield himself from attack, and become invisible.  I used this capability sometimes, but probably not as much as I should have.

The most irritating thing about this game is that it doesn't have a traditional manual SAVE function.  It has checkpoints that are sometimes spaced quite far apart.  There are rooms you can go to to save your game, but they are not a good substitute for manual or quick saves.  In any case, instead of automatically saving your game when it gets to a checkpoint (and even between levels), it asks you first.  I've never seen that in a game before.

There were some vehicles at one point, but the game was mostly played on foot.  Enemies consisted of soldiers and various bots, including spider bots that attacked in numbers.

Overall, I found the game to be enjoyable, although somewhat short.  Graphics and environment were about average for a 2005 game.  Having all the weapons was fun, if unrealistic.

The game did crash a couple times, closing and going back to Windows, but nothing terribly serious happened and it didn't happen enough to be an annoyance.  I just restarted it and picked up at the last saved game.  Incidentally, I am running Vista x64.

For the $2.55 (plus shipping) price I paid (new from an Amazon third party merchant), I found this game to be well worth the cost and good for about 10-15 hours of fun.",positive

2196,"This game has a lot going for it: good graphics, good sound, and an innovative idea.  You command a squad of foot soldiers: ordering them to move and take cover, or to lay down supressive fire.
But after a while, the game gets very repetitive.  Before long, it seems like you're doing the same thing over and over: move a squad to cover, have them lay down suppressive fire while the other squad moves, then throw a smoke or frag grenade.
The enemy AI is pretty shoddy - oftentimes they don't realize when they're being flanked.  Enemy units take up defensive positions and never press your position.
There's only one plane of play.  In other words, you can't move upstairs and fire down on enemies (although they may be positioned above you).
Finally, the multiplayer is pretty weak.  On x-box live you can play co-operative through the levels that are avalible on the single player mode (one person command one squad while the other commands the other squad).  And if you don't have x-box live there is no multiplayer.

2199,"This is the first Assassin's Creed game I've played, so I can't compare it to any of the previous installments, just give a few general impressions. It's a fun game, but unless you're particularly invested in the AC franchise or gameplay certainly doesn't stand out.

GOOD

I take it one of the main draws of the AC franchise is the ability to play around in a variety of historical settings. The game does a great job recreating Victorian London. There are some fun cameos from famous historical figures. If you've ever wanted to get into a brawl fight outside a London pub, this game might be for you.

Having the player divide time between two characters, Evie and Jacob Frye, a male and female, makes a lot of sense. It makes the game more accessible to male and female characters. It also means you don't have to commit at the beginning of the game to playing as in stealth or brawler modes (I always hate making that choice before I've even played a game). The interaction between Jacob and Evie is quite witty, often a highlight of the game.

BAD

The gameplay just isn't very exciting. There are a limited set of combat moves. There are also only a limited number of enemy types, most just brawlers who punch or use knives. The game ends up feeling repetitive very quickly. Compared to the Shadow of Mordor gameplay, which has an expanded move set and dynamic enemy types.

Also, the story is pretty thin. Basically just a set of excuses to go kill people. Granted, this is a combat game, not an RPG. However, it seems the game hasn't fully decided to abandon the story. There are a lot of cutscenes, to the point where it undermines the pacing of the game.

Overall, AC Syndicate can be fun, but with so many other great games out there I'd put this one lower on the wishlist.",neutral
2200,"I've played several RTS games out there - so I had high hopes for this one.

But let me just say this - if you play in skirmish mode (open maps vs. the computer) - you're probably not going to be able to win anything above easy - because the computer cheats.

And even in the easy mode - the computer doesn't seem to have to follow the same resource rules that you do.

Case in point - I had gotten the computer down to one low ammo resource point - yet it was able to have an unending supply of tanks come in from off screen.

And, as somebody else mentioned - when you start the round, and you only have enough resources for a couple of rifle squads, the computer has already gone through the upgrade tree - and has top of the line tanks.

Personally, I think it's just laziness on the part of Relic to have to resort to the computer cheating in order to create levels of difficulty.

And, as others have mentioned - your unit AI isn't exactly that smart either. You order a unit to attack an enemy unit - and half the time, you unit runs right up to the enemy and starts shooting at them - instead of finding a good spot (or even attacking from where they were when you told them to attack).

The rear of the tank is the weak spot - yet I've watched tanks on my team advance on the enemy backwards - with their weaker rear armor exposed - rather than turning around to face them with their better frontal armor.",positive

2205,"I wanted to review this game back when I pre-order it but I forgot to review it so here I go and share my opinion and experience on the game. First off, I want to say thank you Amazon for the best pre-order deal that I have even gotten!!! The pre-order was a free digital copy of the original Crysis game if any new buyers didn't know. That was a pretty sweet pre-order deal right there if you ask me. So anyways, for my review on the game, I'd like to say this game is good, but not quite at that level where more people would want to play it. And I 'm talking about multiplayer wise. The multiplayer is good. It give it more of a challenge compare to CoD and Battlefield because of the cloaking system Crysis 3 have. One thing I wish Crysis 3 had is more weapons. The more variety of weapons there are, the more fun it will be. Same thing goes to maps. (Not sure if this game has any DLC yet...I should check though.) But to sum it up about the multiplayer, it was really fun.

For the story mode in Crysis 3, personally I thought it was too repetitive. Like for example, when you're fighting enemies during every new chapters in the game, you can really see the game play repeats itself. In the gameplay, you can either fight your enemies stealthy/hacking/using bow& arrows or just go gun burst which mean if you go gun burst, more enemies will come and try to kill you. That game play I mention; you do that over and over as you progresses in each chapter of the game. That sort of made the game boring to me. I know some people play for the story Crysis offer. But I'm the kind of guy who love a good story plus fun game play. I still like Crysis series story line though.

Overall, this game got potential for its multiplayer. They could change it up a bit with more weapons and upgrade like I said. Game play in Campaign mode could have been done better. Honestly, I thought the game was just OK. Would I recommend it..? Well...it's up to you guys. Watch Youtube videos about this game and see if it fits your game style.",positive
2206,"When it comes to the television show Family Guy, some of the best episodes out there are the ones in which Brian and Stewie travel together and actually don't feature the rest of the cast. One of the better episodes was an episode in which Brian and Stewie traveled through the Multiverse. Apparently the creators know how popular the episode is because they made a video game that was a sequel to it. Back to Multiverse can be considered fan service in just about every respect. If you really love the show and its humor you'll really love this game to a certain extent. And while it's packed full of references it's hard to say this is a game worth forking over sixty dollars for. If anything it would've easily sufficed as a downloadable game on PSN or XBOX Live Arcade. There isn't really enough content to justify the price tag (though it's sure to go down eventually).

Back to the Multiverse begins in typical Family Guy fashion. It's as though you're playing through an actual episode of the show. It plays the opening of the show--credits and all--as though this really is going to be a typical episode. It then shows Brian and Stewie. Their banter is quickly interrupted when Bertrum shows up from a different universe. He wants revenge on Stewie and is about the travel the multiverse to amass an army. It's up to Stewie and Brian to stop him by following him through the multiverse. As far as Family Guy goes, the actual synopsis for this episode is definitely pretty cool. And it's got some great humor in many respects. The cutscenes themselves are full of some nice witty banter between Brian and Stewie but once you get into the actual game only your fan devotion is likely to hold you. And you'll need to be a die hard fan of the show for it more so than just someone who watches it every now and then.

There are ten levels in Back to the Multiverse. Each complete with objectives. You'll never get lost as there is a marker that will always show you where to go and where you should be. Each level seems to have its own theme. There's one level where it's all filled with Amish. Another where everyone is crippled and you must battle through their fortress and a few more surprises I won't spoil. Although there isn't much to spoil. Any die-hard fan of the show will have seen this all before. You don't get the sense there was much created from scratch for the game.

You'll play as Brian and Stewie and be able to switch between them on the fly. Each of them have their own set of weapons at their disposal. Stewie has his trademark ray guns and inventions while Brian has the standard stuff like pistols, shotguns and rifles. Characters also have secondary weapons and items they can use. You can throw diaper bombs with Stewie or molotov cocktails with Brian. It seems like there is a lot of variety but Back to Multiverse puts an emphasis on shooting your way through. And hordes of enemies will come at you from everywhere. The difficulty spikes seem a little unbalanced. One minute everything seems manageable, the next you're overrun and barely able to survive. It's okay though, because a lot of health packs and ammo are plentiful throughout each level. There isn't really too much variety in the objectives, though. Many times it's usually finding something to open passage so you can move forward, or it's something along the lines of killing a certain enemy to move on.

As you kill enemies you'll also collect cash. You'll be able to use this to buy more weapons and costumes, as well as increase your health or the amount of ammo you can carry.

Every level is filled with references to the show. But this is actually part of the problem. You'll find characters in levels and hear your enemies and people close by spouting off their lines. The thing is... you've heard nearly all of it before. Many of the lines are lifted directly from the show. Every now and then there is something original but for the most part, if you're that familiar with the show you've heard all these lines before. This brings about another small issue with the game in and of itself... you will hear them constantly. These lines pop up again and again. In the very first level you'll constantly hear a frat boy saying, ""I'm angry, but not because I'm gay."" It gets old really fast. Whenever Stewie picks up ammo he'll say the ""This is my rifle/this is my gun..."" line from the episode where he and Brian went into the army. It's constant, though and after a while it's just annoying. At first you'll probably enjoy this. Then again, with so many lines throughout the entire history of the show you're apt to wonder why they didn't lift a bigger variety of them.

The biggest drawback is that the game is relatively short with little replay value. The game can easily be completed in 3 to 5 hours. It's brief, just like an episode of the show. And while some of it is funny and witty, it's really only the cutscenes that are really that fun or engaging to watch.

At the very least fans of the show will be happy to know that the writers and voice actors did step up to the plate to help out with the story and characters. The cast is here to deliver their lines and it's done rather well. The graphical presentation is a little jarring at first. It's cartoon like, which is a good thing. On the other hand, some animations seem a little stilted. Mostly the cutscenes and the lip movements from time to time. Likewise, the game being in 3D makes certain aspects look just a tad... strange. Such as looking at Stewie's hair or Brian up close. Nevertheless those are small nitpicks. There are also moments in which you might feel the game could use a couple more details. A lot of environments strangely feel scarce or empty. I like that it looks like the cartoon, but you sometimes get the sense that they could've done a little more.

Back to the Multiverse isn't a bad game at all. It is a little steep to pay the full sixty dollar price tag for a game that's this short and doesn't offer nearly as much replay value. There are a few extra things to do outside of the main story, but it's really nothing special. It's a great amount of fan service at least and if you're a die hard fan you may like it. Otherwise you may want to wait for just a little bit.",positive
2207,"The People who made this game ruined it. First - they used the Super NES version from ""Super mario all stars"" and did even more enhancing to it (beside the graphics). They made mario talk. That is so annoying. This should have been made into a classic NES series like Super Mario bros. 1 was. The updated graphics aren't bad but it just doesn't make the game the original version",negative

2211,"It's not often that I find a game that I really enjoy and get into to the point that I'll spend day after day engrossed in it. This game is like that. Unfortunately though, most of my playtime with it is trending heavily towards ""redoing stuff I've done 5, 6, 7, 8 times"" and ""manually saving every 5 feet""

 The auto save Just makes no sense in terms of when it decides to save and is totally unreliable. Complete a mission objective? Save. Walk through a door? Save. Complete a more crucial mission objective and die a minute later? No save. You're going back through an hour's worth of mucking around again. Kill a guy you meant to keep alive? Auto save. You're going back even further to whatever your last manual save was.

I'm not particularly interested in completing every single thing or even making it through undetected. I just want to get through the level and try to keep the main targets alive on the first play through. and between managing my saves like an old school NES game and a couple of small glitches that make you fall through floors and shows your location to all the NPCs ""enthralling"" is quickly getting replaced by ""infuriating""",positive
2212,To me it wasn't a great game but not bad.  Its a free roam shooter.  It is a fun game but after a while I was getting sick of people invading my city.  I also wasn't a huge fan of how long it took to lose the cops.  The really cool feature in this was hacking into peoples phones and learning about them.  It made you think twice about hacking into someones bank account if they were a good person but there were also immoral people which made it a little easier to not only rob them but perhaps rough them up a bit.,negative
2213,Hello. My wife bought this game for me. Just a friendly warning. This game is region locked so if your console is not NTSC it will not work so please check your region before buying it.

It turns out they work on my machine because they are universally compatible games and can still work in other regions despite being made for the US. .,negative
2214,"Overall, I found this game to be fun, though it is a series of mini courses, which is not what I was expecting. I do like that there are a variety of themes, but expected there to be more than three holes in each theme. The load time lagged a little, but it was no slower than most games. The trick shot courses, obstacles and additional bonus games are pretty fun and different, in that you can use the wii remote in a variety of ways. I think the game would be more fun in multi-player mode, especially in a party or family setting. I don't think it's for little kids though, unless they are just trying to hit the ball... I'm no golf pro but I did unlock two different sets of puzzle pieces on my first, which gets you accessories like new golf clubs.",positive
2215,"Visually F.E.A.R 2 is impressive. It features some terrific maps (although it's still a bit too much of a corridor shooter), cut-scenes, and in-game animations, the character modelling is good and it has a host of nice atmospheric touches. It also introduces some imaginative new enemies not seen in the original, including the reanimators, who bring dead grunts back to life as flailing, gun-toting zombies, and pesky, shrivelled guys in shorts, who scurry about like Gollum on speed. F.E.A.R 2 is also pretty creepy at times -- it actually made me jump once or twice. It's a shame, however, that these jolts are isolated to brief sections of the game with long gaps between. The story's okay though unremarkable. The combat ranges from quite easy to pretty tough (on the normal setting). The tasks are typical: finding keycards and whatnot -- nothing particularly inspiring. So far so whatever -- it's a good game but not a great one. On to my main criticisms. The PC controls are a bit twitchy, but more of a problem is the way your character moves. The amount of head-bob is insane. I mean truly bonkers. Beckett bounces along as though on a pogo stick. It irritated the hell out of me and significantly reduced my enjoyment of the game. Then there's the lack of humour. Aside from a few quips within the intel reports there is none. Overall this is a visually and technically striking game that's well worth playing but won't linger fondly in the memory or have much replay appeal. 3.5/5.",positive

2217,"Xenosaga 2 looked like it would be a great game, I mean updated graphics, continuation of a good storyline, and probably one of the most noticable changes, Shion's makeover.  Unfortunately, this game falls a long way below the expectation I had.

Where to begin, the first noticable change is the graphics system, which is a good thing.  It's easy to tell how the character is reacting or feeling.  Also, the more realistic environments add to the seriousness this game has.

Anothing new change are the costumes, which work but are, in some cases, kind of creepy.  Shion now sports an outfit that shows a little more skin (it's not that I don't like scamply clad women, I do, it's just not the Shion I know), Momo gets a navy-like costume, Jr. gets something similar to the past game, and so on and so forth.

The biggest change you notice though is the voice actors.  Shion, KOS-MOS, MOMO, and chaos each have different people doing the voices.  Shion, MOMO, and chaos don't bother me as much as KOS-MOS' because now she sounds almost human as opposed to the cybernetic voice in Episode 1.

I figured that wouldn't bother me for long, but then I get into the game and find out that they messed up the battle system.  No longer do each character have their unique moves, but instead each character can learn the same moves depending on what they spend their points on.  The only good change to this is the Dual Techs which allows two characters to do a move on an enemy.  Physical attacks also suck in this game because you have no control as opposed to the ability to change them in Episode 1.

So, we start off with new voice actors, an even worse battle system, and some really confusing battles.  The battles get confusing because now you have to Break the character to weaken it by using the right combinations of buttons, which is really annoying to do.

So what are the redeeming factors you ask?  Well, we've got the storyline, the graphics, and the new costumes.  If that's all that you want, then great, pick it up, otherwise stay far, far away from this game.

Pros:

- Continuation of the epic saga

- New costumes for the characters

- More mature look

- Dual Techs

Cons:

- The change in voice actors

- The battle system

- The long loading times to get into battle

- Taking away the unique abilities that each character could learn.

- The side quests are more annoying this time around and more bountiful, but if you want more dual techs, you have to do them.",positive

2223,"I'll keep this review short and simple. I am semi-new to the MMORPG genre, but I know/ have played enough to say that this game is nothing special. It is basically a Star Wars WoW.... That's it. The only thing that separates this game from WoW is the interactions for quests. Now that is actually a really AWESOME thing about the game. In fact, arguably it's strong suit. This is 2012; there should be no excuse for the downright horrible graphics. I understand that they want to tailor the game to as many people as possible... But does that mean use a Nintendo 64 graphic engine? This is arguably the worst quality of the game. I find myself not really caring about my character, their progression or anything that is really happening. Zones or ""planets"" really don't feel big enough... They're just sectioned off areas with some windy tunnels, buildings, etc.. No, you can't just whip on over to Tatooine and explore at will. This game doesn't work that way. There isn't really freedom to explore. Basically a roller coaster which really is unfortunate. So if you are looking for an average MMO with horrible graphics but great story. This should be it for you!

Side note for those of you who were avid fans of KOTOR and KOTOR 2: this game does not follow along with those games in the least. No mention of them or any characters in those game's... It's as if they never existed, in fact, I don't even think this is in the same century as those games. I think they got the time period's wrong with this game but... I'm no expert.",positive

2229,"There's a lot to like about this game, mainly the great cel-shaded 3D that looks very much like an actual episode of the Simpsons.  The cut-scenes look almost exactly like a Simpsons episode, and the voice acting is superb (obviously, since all the original voices are used).  The game has a good amount of humor as well, considering it's a Simpsons game.  There are even some very obscure jokes for superfans (in one level there are some solid gold ""dogs with bees in their mouths, so when they bark they shoot bees at you"").

Unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily make up for the gameplay, which cannot fairly be called anything but boring.  Even the traditional side-scrolling platformer format can be fun (see The New Super Mario Bros), but in the Simpsons game it seems they just copied and pasted a bunch of terrain and bad guys and left it at that.  The most exciting moments are where the cooperative play (you switch off between Simpsons family members, each with different abilities) is used to its fullest potential.  Of course, even that is overused and becomes tedious.

Overall, actually playing the game will make you angry and sleepy, but you'll probably enjoy the cutscenes, jokes and voice acting.  Keep an eye out for Futurama cameos.  Pet homer is kind of fun for about 2 minutes, as well.

I can only recommend this game to curious Simpsons fans.",positive
2230,"Mortal Kombat, back in 1991, dominated the arcade scene and gave Street Fighter II a run for its money. So when news broke that it was coming out for the SNES and Genesis consoles, everyone rejoiced and the bragging rights for best version of this game was up for grabs. When the dust cleared, it was obvious each version had its pros and cons.

For the SNES this was, for the most part, a faithful port of the arcade game. It had all the stages and the ""Test Your Might"" mini-games, the original music, the original characters plus the secret character and the end boss, Shang Tsung. The graphics were crisp and clear while the music sounded just like in the arcade game; controls were easy to get used like in the arcade game. However, the game came heavily censored; the blood was changed to look like sweat. Some of the fatalities were toned down considerably and replaced with ""non violent"" finishing moves (Kano, Sub Zero, Johnny Cage and Raiden.) They even went as far as to make sure you could not send anyone through the spikes at one stage that takes place on top of a bridge when you wanted to fulfill the requirement to fight the secret character, Reptile. The controls, while easy to get used to, were slightly changed from the arcade game and some of the basic moves were taken out entirely.

So it was a major gamble for Nintendo that didn't pay off; the Genesis version, while regarded as inferior to the SNES version because of its fuzzy graphics and featured different music for the stages, had the gore and fatalities available as long as you entered a secret code. Sales wise, it beat out the SNES version as punishment for the backlash against Nintendo's family friendly policy.

Pick this one up only for nostalgic reasons as Mortal Kombat II, is the sequel and better game and it came out fully uncensored.",neutral
2231,"I can't find a pad that works with the Wii at any retail outlets, so I ordered it here. It took about 2-3 months to get it shipped to me (Amazon even wrote to ask if I still wanted to wait for this product to get to them so they could ship it to me).

I unpacked the pad 3 days ago. Still have not danced on it. WHY? Because of the plastic chemical smell. I am leaving it outside on sunny days to burn off the smell that I find a little annoying and my husband really can't stand, it makes him a bit ill. (I got the pad for him as with the game you can only play with others if you have 2 or more pads). Think I am picky and overplaying the smell? I opened it in the living room. Our roommate who's bedroom is all the way down the hall, a good 75 feet away came out after about 20 minutes to find out what the smell was that was wafting into his room.

The smell is less and I figure it will bake out soon. But I would hate to be in the factory or the warehouse that makes these pads. Plus, if they make it so hard to get the pad, no wonder the game is not selling so well any more. But as it is the only one I could find I am gonna give it a full week to air out, then try it out. If it works I am keeping it.",positive
2232,"I must first start off this review by saying that I genuinly had a lot of fun playing Rygar on PS2. This sequal to the original NES classic holds up well in some departments, and fails in others, but nothing that would keep this game from well, being any less fun to play.
Now let's start with the goods: The graphics. Yes, the graphics have to be the number 1 thing to mention first because they have got to be probably the most amazing things I've seen in a video game. Now, if you play this you may disagree with me because  a lot of the graphics seem more ""fantasy"" oriented then in a game like Metal Gear Solid, but talking in that point of view I stick with my previous statement. Rygar is created with the upmost detail and his movements flow very well, offering plenty of realism. The levels are monumental, everthing from shadows, to different auras of light are absolutely flawless and breathtaking. I swear some of the levels were just so vast and beautiful I couldn't help but just stare and say ""WHOOOOAHHH!"" This makes exploration in the game very fun. The controls in the game are also very crisp, responsive and variable. Using your diskarmor (you can knab 3 kinds) you will hack and slash you way through levels being able to use different combo's of moves to destroy your opponents. The diskarmor is truly one of the best and most fun weapons you will use in any video game available today. And third, the soundtrack consists of a very creative and enjoyable symphonic orchestrial type music almost to be able to match wits with Castlevania on PS1. Now, there are other things that make up a good game, like story, challenge, and creativity. This is where Rygar falls.
When it comes to a good story, Rygar is pretty basic but still very tolerable. It's not very fun to follow, it's a little uncomprehendable and sometimes boring where you don't care for the cinematic sequences but just to get on with the action. You come across lot's of different writings which you pick up throughout the game, these are like memo's and such to those who are familiar with Resident Evil or Silent Hill games. You read these to figure out what actually happened to this ancient Greek world, who the bad guys are and what they are doing. Unfortunately for these, they're also not very interesting, and not very easy to follow, so you end up discarding the information as it doesn't seem relevent to the game as a whole. Another dissappointing aspect is the overall challenge in the game. It's too easy. Now, a lot of video games lately have been too easy for the simple fact that games that have too much challenge tend to turn off today's gamers and are seen as unmarketable, so this in turn makes a lot of games nowadays too easy, like this one. The enemies aren't very smart, as they will mostly dance around you and hit you about every 4 or 5 seconds and at the same time, take off very little energy. So all you need to kill these baddies is just the tapping of one of the attack buttons. This is dissappointing seeing as how the diskarmor is such an amazing, versitile weapon but seems never to have to be taken full advantage of. The first couple of bosses add some of a challenge but then as you go further, these guys just become so easy to kill it's almost laughable, it's just too hard to die. Something else that most gamers will find dissapointing is the game's length. I found to not be too long or too short but if you're a die-hard gamer looking for something that'll keep you busy for a while, don't look towards this one. One 5 day rental from this one and you'll most likely be done with it within the first 3 days. Those who don't have as much time on thier hands will find this game a decent length, but will ultimately be unsatisfied with how quickly they got to the end.
Unfortunately due to these downfalls, I had to give this 3 stars, but I do HIGHLY recommemend a rental on this one as it is a whole lot of fun to play without any technical problems like controls to be frustrated with, and if you ignore the bland story and lack of challenge which don't ever hurt the gameplay as a whole.",positive
2233,"While it is a great way to store games for travel, it is somewhat difficult to get games in and out of it.

I'm thinking it might just need some breaking it to get the games to start slipping in and out of the compartments with ease, but for now it's a hassle to do so",negative
2234,"Ok, like I said in my title, this game has amazing graphics, and a very decent story. I really enjoyed the whole scope of the game (like driving across miles and miles of alien infested highway while you're making you're way from town to town. Another aspect I loved was the whole switch from the military look to the shootout at the abandoned gas station (truly classic material!) I do however have some serious reservations in reccomending this game.
1. Poor Dialogue. This game has pretty cheesy conversations and not the best voice acting either. : (
2. No Real Sense of Apocolypse or Terror. This game manages to out ""shiny"" itself (losing the grit of a true sci-fi terror game.
3. Feels Generic. I'm afraid this game has fallen into the rut so many have nowdays, and forgot to establish it's trademarks. tsk tsk. The game has no memorable main theme, no lovable main character-hero and no interesting twist of plot or theme.
Overall:
Area 51 is a highly entertaining shooter, that relies far too heavily on shiny graphics and generic action to solidify itself against other recent FPS ventures. Worth a rental!

2236,"The first thing I liked right off the bat was that it was just as simple as putting the figure on the portal.  No codes to enter, no disc to install.

I've got some really mixed feelings about Infinity.  They're as much of a money grab as Skylanders is - never expand an existing set, just keep putting out whole new ""master"" sets that you have to get if you want to continue.  My second complaint is that driving a vehicle in Infinity is, to put it mildly, insanely frustrating.  It's nothing like driving something that's WELL done, like Mario Kart, or Sonic All Stars Racing.  Driving in Infinity blows chunks.  I've hated it every time it's come up.  So I really was afraid this was just going to be more of the horrible controlled vehicluar frustration.

And it was.  Granted, it's a LITTLE better than the standard driving is, but it's still just as awful for ""feel"" while driving.  Drifting is really just an intermittent thing.  Sometimes it isn't horrible, other times it really just stinks.  You can go into the same turn at the same speed with the same car and character and one time it's better, one time it's worse.  And the car really just seems to pick random directions sometimes to go in if you hit a wall.  Nothing more frustrating than suddenly finding yourself going at a right angle, or worse, the wrong way, after bumping a wall in a turn.

Then there is just a TON of screen tearing, and long load times both starting a race, and trying to get out of one.  All this is on an Xbox One.

The graphics are about on par for the Infinity system, so sub par from any other racing kart game out there, but not too bad.  My son is far more forgiving than I am about the actual physics and behavior, and enjoys the tracks with familiar themes.  He is a big racing game fan, but this one he's not holding to the same standards as the others since it's characters and places he enjoys.  So he's less competitive here, and just enjoying the scenery more.  So I've added a star just based on that factor, since for me, it would've been a 2 star result, but because of his enjoyment of it anyway, I'll give it three.",neutral
2237,"Minecraft inspired gameplay with simple rpg elemnts and world of DQ. The games story isn't supposed to be grand in any fashion or taken seriously because that was the intention. But when it comes to the exploration and freedom it feels quite limited and lacking. There is a free mode in which your free to do as you please on your own pace and time but It requires story completion to unlock islands and items, even so after story completion it feels rather empty and recycled. The joy of it comes from building things to your liking with supplies and some combat but It does get old halfway through.

The combat, story and mechanics are simple which is nice for a pickup and play. Apart from what I have said, I do like this hybrid of crafting and Rpg, There's potential for it to grow and expand on everything it has done in a probable sequel, I found this game interesting enough even If I never played Minecraft and had no interest in it. I only once had to force a character death to get me out of a stuck glitch while I was doing a defense quest but apart from that this game has been very stable for which I applaud because so many games come out broken and rushed. Version of game is 1.0 which is a surprise coming from this day and age where the industry is full of greed and corruption.

I really don't see this game being worth its full price at $60 plus, But if its under $30 bucks I can recommend it, it felt short and the replay value from free mode doesn't cut it.",positive
2238,"In late 2002, I took a second job at a major electronics retailer and decided to use my employee discount on what looked like a cool game: Civilization III.  That game changed my life... in the gaming sense.  It was everything I ever thought a computer game should be: turn-based strategy with multiple avenues to test my ego and self-promoted genius.  Above all features of Civ3, however, my most favorite was the customization of the game through the map editor and the wonderful online resources of the Civ community.  (I've downloaded more Civ3 files than MP3s.)  This allowed me to express my self-proclaimed genius with new rules, technologies, and units (and all the accompanying chronologies and requisites) at my discretion.  Nothing could get any better, I had thought.

When Civ4 was being talked about, however, I couldn't imagine on what grounds they could improve - except perhaps making the game even more customizable and thorough.  Well, you've already read about the differing features of the game: less micro-management, more diplomatic and trade features, new technology trees, enhancing popular mechanics found in previous Civ titles, and of course, going 3D with it all.

When playing Civilization IV, you sense an overwhelming POTENTIAL to be a really great game.  In my mind, that potential has not been fulfilled, and I hereby advise you to purchase Civ3 Complete instead and forego Civ4 if you haven't chosen so already.  If you have already purchased Civ4, let's send a message to Firaxis Games that they need to do better - let's stop purchasing Civ products until they are actually without so many bugs, that aren't rushed to be released for the holidays, and that don't insult our intelligence by requiring expensive ""expansion packs"" which merely add content that should already have been included in the original release.

Here is a list of comparative reasons to only own Civ3 and not Civ4 and boycott future Civ titles until something changes for the better:

1.  There is no map editor in Civ4.  Instead, they included a ""World Builder"" which is so awkward and strange.  It is not like Civ3's map editor where you can set starting positions, resources, civilizations, and terrain BEFORE you play the map.  The ""World Builder"" of Civ4 only allows you to alter scenarios from the installation or randomly generated maps.  You cannot create maps from scratch - you can only change what has already been created within predefined parameters.

2.  Who needs 3D graphics for a turn-based strategy game?  Civ4 is not fully 3D; it merely allows a tilting view from ground level to overhead.  That can be cool, but consider the offset: it is unnecessary for this genre, it diverts computer resources from other cool and more thorough features, and it makes the game extremely difficult to modify.  For Civ3, there are well over 1,000 things you can either download or make yourself and put right into the game.  You don't have to know XML or Python programming languages as you would in Civ4.  Civ4 requires advanced education (like a graphics design or computer science degree) to simply alter things like governments, units, buildings, and game rules.  Waiting for others to design them (like the amateur online community or the professional expansion packs) isn't so fun anymore.

3.  Expanding content for more money?  This was a problem with Civ3, as well - its first expansion pack was a total waste of money because everything was later put on the second expansion pack.  People bought the first expansion pack because they loved Civ3 so much and didn't know it was a waste.  (Many video game makers are taking advantage of gamers in this way, not just the Civilization makers.)  My point here is to fight back.  We already know what they are going to pull: Civ4 has an expansion pack out there titled Warlords.  It basically includes elements intentionally left out so as to somehow formulate a ""new"" product.  In the base version of Civ4, you have the Great People: artists, scientists, merchants, and prophets.  Hmmm... now we get the warlords, eh?  Oh, and a few other civilizations and buildings left out from before.  Nice try...  Boycott this type of marketing out of sheer principle.  Play Civ3 Complete until Civ5 comes out if you have to.  Maybe Civ will be less of a cheap shot then.

4.  The last reason why you should be content with Civilization III and completely forget that Civilization IV was ever made is the most simple.  Purchasing Civ3 Complete right now (1) will cost you less than half of Civ4; (2) is fully expanded while Civ4 is still looking to make more money off of us; and (3) Civ3 has the very same level of addictive game play as any other Civilization title.  If you have already dropped the cash for Civ4, simply do not support Civ4 any longer.  In fact, uninstall it and put it in your drawer as a sad chapter of shameless marketing.  Yes, Civ4 is fun, but it is does not live up to its potential in most ways.  Playing Civ3 will take up your time quite nicely until they release a REAL title that doesn't take advantage of us so blatantly.

To conclude, my overall point to stick with Civ3 and forego Civ4 is this: without an easy, efficient, and overwhelmingly powerful customizing interface (like an awesome map editor that allows FULL customization), we are simply asking for ""re-tread"" products.  The fact that Firaxis did not include a kick-butt map editor proves in my mind that they expect us to wait for their ""expansions"" to come out and spend at least $150 each before they move onto Civ5.  Hold out with Civ3 Complete and wait until Civ4 goes away.",neutral

2241,"Maybe I'm an idiot or didn't take my time but putting them on ruined my rubber analog sticks on my Microsoft brand controller. I nudged each one in but then noticed a good amount of rubber was being sliced off on the outer edges in doing this. If I decide to remove them, I'd have damaged analog sticks. Probably will just have to leave them on now. This also created an uneven-ness on the analogs sticks cause of the sliced up rubber. They're slumping a little bit to the side (not from broken analogs but of the tiny bulges from the sliced up rubber). Attach at your own risk!

On my 2nd pair, I put them on my 3rd party controller. The Turbo Fire 2. The analog sticks are made of plastic and are flat. It snapped on fine. The problem is they spin around. Kind of like the ball top to an arcade joystick. I just did a ghetto mod and used clear scotch tape to keep them down. Worked!

On the product themselves, noticed a little difference in better accuracy. A lot better on my 3rd party controller Turbo Fire 2 cause the analogs were garbage plastic and flat. Not worth if for my Microsoft controller since its now damaged. Hard to remove. If I did, I'd probably damage the rubber even worse.

UPDATE #1: I have just received my replacement Hori EX 2 Turbo controller in the mail (see the reviews for those issues). They fit perfectly and is very snug. The shape differs from the regular controller which why they fit so nice. It didn't rip up the analog sticks themselves even using slight force and taking about 5 second putting them on (though you should take your time just in case). Removing them isn't a problem in which takes a couple seconds but it did leave minor indentations (which didn't bother me). It does improve the precision and accuracy for me. The analog sticks on the Hori EX 2 Turbo are a little bit higher than the standard controller so adding these make it even higher. Cause of this, it may not be for everyone. Didn't really bother after using them for a bit.

Update #2 (12/29/10) - Just wanna update my review about the fitting of these items. In my review above, I stated it can shred and rip apart the sides of your analog sticks. I recently tried them on my friend's controller. I carefully and slowly fit them on the his analogs. It fit pretty snug and w/o any damage or indents to the analogs. It seems they were different sizes. I can't explain it. Looks the same and the colors are the same. We both bought our controllers the same holiday season when the Xbox 360 was released. I don't know why they'd be differ sizes. I bought a pair of replacement analogs from ebay to replace my damaged ones. Gave them a try and they fit nicely on those too. I felt so happy about this product that I purchased another 2 pair.",neutral
2242,"Unlike the console versions of mega budget feature film video game tie-in, Transformers for the DS has been split into two different games that reflect the warring robot sides.  The Autobot version of Transformers for the DS allows you to play as the heroic Optimus Prime and his team of Autobots as they battle the evil Decepticons on Earth.  The best thing about Transformers: Autobots and Decepticons respectively is that you will get a different gaming experience out of both versions, even though there are plenty of mirrored core mechanics to be found as well.  First off, you'll notice that the robots themselves look great and are nicely rendered as well.  Not to mention that scanning other vehicles is a nice touch, and the open world environments (while limited) are nicely done as well.  The overall presentation of Transformers: Autobots is great, but what really hurts the game is the assortment of bugs and glitches that you'll come across when playing.  The game's camera can also be unforgiving, and the environments are lacking in overall detail.  Despite all that though, Transformers: Autobots manages to succeed in the departments it could have easily failed in like so many licensed, movie tie-in video games often do.  In that respect alone, Transformers: Autobots, as well as the Decepticons version, are worth checking out for Transformers fans and DS owners alike.",positive

2247,"This game seemed to have good potential with good music, good and fun gameplay, and nice features like customizing your teams and players.  Unfortunately, the AI in one-player mode is the cheapest I have ever seen (even with difficulty level set to easy).  For example, don't expect the opposing team to need more than 20 seconds to score on you.

The opposing punt returners are evidentally he-man capable of busting through five guys consistenly to always return no less than 60 yards.  When I return a punt, even with my clash turned on, I get laid out like floor tile as soon as the first guy touches me.  Even worse, if I am fast enough to juke a couple time and actually get some yardage on my return, as soon as someone hits me I fumble at least half the time.

Usually on the second or third play of the opposing team's drive they throw the most beautiful pass you've ever seen and all of the idiots on my team are no where to be found (no matter what play I call in the huddle).  I swear, I have to be the one to make the tackle like 80% of the time.  And if my guys are actually covering someone, a majority of the time they get pushed aside or run over like a little girl.

As for the throwing game--even when my guys are wide open they drop the ball at least half the time.  Even after you upgrade your guys and buy nice gloves for them, whenever you throw to them the ball will bounch out of their hands twice, then float about ten yards over to the left, and then: interception!!!  Needless to say, my running game is my only hope of ever scoring.

The play book is really skimpy too.  Seriously, I have like three running moves, and one of them is an awful fake that fails every time.  How many times can I use those before they start moving their entire line up to the left because that is where all my running plays go?

This game might be fun with a buddy, but playing the campaign mode against the computer is enough to bring even Lawrence Taylor to tears.",positive
2248,"After hearing how great this game is, I bought it on the day of the release.  Yup, I have to admit that it was fun driving anywhere around the city (even subways and water) to pick up/drop off passengers.  The computer comments were pretty funny and there was no slowdown when number of items were on the screen at the same time.
But after about 2 hours of playing, I realized how disappointed I was with this game.  As others have eluded to, it gets old driving around the same city.  There was no drivers or cars to unlock.  This makes longevity of the game questionable.  Also the fact that there's no 2 player mode made me cringe.  I'm not sure if the 4 characters had any differences between them either (though I heard they're suppose to).
Though this was a fun game, I ended up returning it after few days.  If you're looking for a fun driving game, you might want to pass on this one and try Rumble Racing instead.  Now there's an idea - incorporate Rumble Racing's unlock track/car feature on Crazy Taxi (or have a new track add-ons or something to keep the game going after a week or so).",positive
2249,"I have played almost all the total war series and there are some amazing games in that line up.  Rome 2 however is probably the worst so far for several reasons.

Cons:

The end turn is insane- 1 to 2 minutes wait at the end of each turn is a sin.  You can no longer pursue a defense or economic/ trade approach because you would literally spend 75% of the game waiting on the AI to process. Your only option is to attack as much a possible to give you something to do each turn besides sit and stare at the faction emblems go by.

It is buggy. Some of the releases have made it better but I have still had units attack for no reason, get stuck at various points throughout the game and most of all the game still crashes somewhat frequently.

They did away with the 3 tier command, manage, influence for characters and made an illogical and complex system to replace it that even once you ""figure it out"" it isn't fun and doesn't make a lot of sense.

There are about 2 videos that continually play when your generals or characters die or become triumphant (no explanation of what that means) and since they don't give you an age anymore you have no idea if your ""superstar"" general is about to die or live for another 10 turns. Also the faction aspect is incredibly confusing and your actions don't really have any major effect on the game.

Pros:

The graphics have improved but they also had a decade since the last game so...

There are a lot more factions and the map is more realistic.

There are some cool new units from Rome 1

Basically generic stuff that you would expect a sequel to do.

Closing:

My biggest complaint isn't the lack of advancement after having a decade pass from the first RTW.  My biggest complaint is that they took away or changed several major factors that made Rome customizable, personal and fun.  I will play through RTW2 one time and then just go back to RTW original if I feel the need to rule the world with the SPQR. Very disappointing! Unlikely they will fix it but hopefully some mods will come out to make it actually playable and fun again.",positive

I was really excited by the interesting storyline presented on the box, but it certainly wasn't a very big part of the game! Enough ranting, here is my review.

Plot- D+ What plot? I never really figured out the plot. There is no creature, so don't get your hopes up there!

Graphics- A++ The fact that the graphics were beautiful was the only reason I gave this game 3 stars. From the waves lapping the beach, to the lush forests, the graphics were incredible! A++++++++++ (This is practically the only good thing I have to say about the game, but it was great!)

Puzzles- C+ There were very few puzzles to actually solve, and you spent most of your time sorting... frass. Frass, in case you don't know, is a fancy way to say insect poop. Lovely. My dream way to spend a few hours! Oh, and you get to study it under a microscope! Aren't you excited already!

Ending- B This game took me about six hours to solve total. Then it ended very abruptly. It was a very, very, very, very short game. There were only four characters in the game, and two of them were involved in the crime. How can you be surprised when they reveal the culprit!

Content A++++ The only other good thing about the game besides the graphics is that (unless sorting frass for hours would somehow be against your principles) it is clean for everyone. No language, no violence.

Overall- C Don't waste your money on this game unless you are a die hard fan of the Nancy Drew games like myself. At least then you can tell yourself that you are being loyal to the games that you used to love. I do still love the old games!",positive

2260,"First, Dead Rising is my favorite zombie game.

That being said.........

There is something to be said about a game that sticks to one simple purpose, and does it well.  Point A to point B, killing as many zombies as you can on the way there.

With more weapons and colorful locations, this game is certainly an improvement over the last one. There are several new multi-player modes and 'villain' creatures that are nice additions.

Core gameplay is basically the same, and in many ways one could almost look at this as an expansion pack of the last game.  Either way, it is still fun when you are in the mood to do some slaughtering.

Of course, the only problem is that all you do is pretty much kill along the way. It is more of the same to some degree but there is something about this level of guts, gore, and intensity that keeps you going.  However, there is still that sense of 'been-there done-that';

For gamers looking for more depth in their FPS, this may not be their thing; but if you are looking for a very bloody good time and want to vent some frustration, then this is def. for you. Being an older gamer, I am sort of at the point where I am looking for something w/more of a story and a 'point'. But when I just want to have mindless fun either in a campaign or online, there is no faulting a game like this that knows what it is and  does it so well.

2264,"Despite all the negative reviews, this isn't even a horrible capture card, it's decent actually. However, it is improperly listed.
This is NOT a high definition capture card. It utilizes the eMPIA 2828X ""USB Grabber"" video chip. This chip maxes out at 480i. This capture card was clearly designed to capture standard definition video and not high definition. Any signal above 480i will not be registered by the video chip. I couldn't even get 480p to record.

Now, that doesn't mean the capture card is horrible. Some people, like myself, don't care about high definition video capture but wanted a device to capture old, retro video game consoles like the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Assuming you're one of these people, how does this stack up?

The outside is designed pretty well, actually. This is the first capture card I've had with a pass-through, meaning, your video signal comes in one end and leaves the other end. This is great because it defeats the need for a splitter since the signal will pass through the device to your television. This device also has a port for a microphone, which is a neat little addition if you don't have a microphone port, and the form-factor is nice. My Easycap would damage my USB ports since it was such a heavy dongle, while this uses an external USB cable to connect to your computer so no weight is actually placed on your USB port.

The inside is where most people's complaints come from, mainly the eMPIA video chip. This chip maxes out at 480i, so if you were hoping for 480p or even 720p/1080i video recording through the component ports, that's not going to happen. The deinterlacing also isn't very good, so interlacing is very noticeable in the actual recordings. The recording also look a little washed out. All in all, the video quality is not good, but it's not atrocious. If you are streaming something like the Wii or original Xbox, it will be quite noticeable because those games visually look great, but if you go something really old school like N64 or PS1, or even NES or SNES, the video artifacts become less apparent. I am fine with the video quality on this device as someone who records and streams retro games very very casually. You should definitely not get this card if you are expecting to high quality professional-level recordings, it won't give you that.

A lot of people have had trouble getting this device to even work, I've had no trouble. It works fine in my experience. The issue is that the eMPIA drivers are Windows-only and are required to be installed from the installation CD. There's no Linux support (believe me, I tried) and to my knowledge no Mac support. This is by no means a plug-in-play device. After you setup the divers, you should easily be able to import the device into OBS for recording and streaming. If you switch between using the component jacks or the composite jacks on the Gamecap, you have to open up VivaStation and switch the input source and then restart OBS. OBS won't automatically be able to detect the change and will just give you a white screen. Also, don't forget that this cannot record above 480i. So if you are still getting a blank screen, make sure your device does not have progressive scan enabled.

I bought this device for standard definition recording as someone who extremely casually does so. The video quality is not amazing but it is good enough for someone like me. The device is very nicely designed with the pass-through video ports, the external USB connection and the additional microphone slot. But the video chip is not the best and it's annoying when software isn't plug-in-play because it takes some time to setup and does not work on every machine.

I think Amazon really needs to fix their listing for this device. I think this device would get much better reviews, at least 3 stars, if the listing wasn't so misleading. This isn't even the developer's fault. The device never claims to be an ""HD recorder"" on the box.",positive

2266,"I am a huge 2K football fan. I played all of their games since the initial 2K release on the Dreamcast. When EA took the license, I was crushed. I was basically forced to play Madden but opted for the PC version (where I can at least save a game in progress.)

When I heard 2K8 was going to come back without the license, I got pretty excited. So, I purchased an XBOX 360 just to get this game.

So, I came home with my copy of All Pro Football 2K8, popped it in and got to a game. Initially, I was like ""This is Next Gen?"" I was a little upset that this is what I waited and paid $60.00 for. (I actually picked up a cheap copy of Madden 07 and played it for a while.)

But as time passed, I kept getting more and more curious about the game and started to play out the lackluster but functional season mode. I started to become more impressed with the animations and the presentation of the game.

Then I headed online..despite a problem where someone disconnected instead of quitting fairly, I am loving on-line play. You get a more competitive game and I've had some real close ones. I am interested in the leagues but it doesn't look like they are getting off the ground well (no one has generated their schedules yet.)

The presentation is great as always. Despite the commentary being 80% recycled from 2K5, this is still miles ahead of any other sports game out there. The halftime and postgame shows are back too.

As a whole, this is not the great ""next gen"" football we've been looking for and a lot of it seems like 2K5 repackaged and stripped of ESPN. But, given the realistic game play (QB's feet need to be set, etc) and good animation and presentation, this one beats out Madden 08 this year and when they get the NFL back...look out!",positive

The graphics are great, obviously, but that doesn't make a game fun. It didn't feel compelling, it felt repetitive and weak on the gameplay side. Be warned...while playing this game you wouldn't believe how loud and hot your console gets, I'd be afraid of it catching fire. I had to use headphones to play this game because of how loud the fan gets.

I ended up deleting my saved data before finishing the game. It took up 50 GB for this short game...I ran out of space after that and I don't plan to play it again.

2270,"Oh boy, Starfox zero.

This is why I bought a Wii U. Starfox is the reason I've bought every Nintendo system. Starfox is love, Starfox is life.

Unfortunately, this particular one has to be the second worst one in the series, with command still holding the lofty title of absolute worst. The game would actually be fantastic if they hadn't tried to shoehorn motion controls in, because they just don't work.

Occasionally, VERY occasionally, they help. Most of the time, though, it feels like I'm fighting the arwing/Walker/landmaster more than I am fighting the enemies. You can sort of disable motion controls for flying in the arwing, but they are required for the gyro, Walker, and landmaster for looking up and down. The control pad keeps going off center, the aiming is fiddly, and having to look at the gamepad constantly actually puts you at a disadvantage during complicated fights because you can barely see what's happening.

This all comes before even mentioning that this is just a reboot of Starfox 64. I can accept retconning Krystal, but I can't accept the fact that after three other games in the series that advanced the plot and universe building, I'm back at square one with a bunch of references that feel forced. I already played Starfox 64, I didn't buy a brand new system 19 years later to play it again in slightly higher res with a clunky control scheme.

Unless they patch the motion controls completely out, avoid this game. It pains me to say this about the series that I love more than any other gaming franchise, but it takes one step forwarx and twelve back.",neutral

However, when it started getting the double click issue constantly after about 6 years, I knew it was time for a new one. This one is an improvement in some aspects but it hardly even feels like the Naga I was used to. The texture was definitely an improvement from the matte finish/glossy plastic sides of the original Naga and the textured grip on the right side of the mouse where your pinky would rest is a great addition.

However, this newer Naga is much larger than the original Naga and since I don't have very large hands, I find myself having to change my normal grip to comfortably reach all of the side buttons. With my normal grip, I pretty much cannot reach the 1, 2 or 3 buttons. There is also a big change in the buttons themselves. They feel much larger and I find that some of them have an angled position with the 5 and 8 buttons feeling as though they are raised more. The 1 and 10 buttons don't feel like they have any sort of angle to them either so there doesn't seem to be much consistency with them. The original Naga had the slight bumps under select buttons to give you a better idea of where your thumb was. That was done away with and now it seems the way to learn where your thumb is at first is to make note of the raised 5 and 8 buttons as a guide to work your thumb outward from each of those. It's not terrible but after using the original for so long, it will obviously take time getting used to something new to get that muscle memory refined for this mouse.

I feel like the sensor is a lot more jumpy than I am used to in normal use with browsing and things like that. I'm not entirely sure how else to explain it but it feels as though it is extremely sensitive and doesn't feel as accurate as I am used to with the previous Naga as well as the Deathadder Elite and Deathadder 3.5G before that. I'm not really sure what the issue is but it feels a little off to me. In MMO games (as it should be used for) the sensor doesn't matter as much since you will mostly be tab targeting or just having to click in a general area rather than precision clicks.

I have a slight issue with the outer sides of the mouse as well that involves the mouse buttons. On either side, the mouse button forms an odd and fairly sharp lip that extends from the very top outside corner of mouse 1 and 2 down to about where the top of the illuminated Razer logo is toward the center of the palm. I imagine it is to keep your finger from sliding off of the buttons but I would have liked to have seen slight grooves in mouse 1 and 2 that your fingers naturally fit into rather than completely flat buttons and these uncomfortable sharper lips.

The lighting (at least on my unit) is a little strange. The scroll wheel seems to never completely match the color on the keypad and logo. It is very slight but you can see it clearly on some colors more than others. For example, if you choose static white, the scroll wheel appears slightly bluish green compared to the lighting on the keypad and logo, which definitely just appear white. Orange looks a lot more dark than the other lights and pink looks more like a faint reddish white. It may just be a hardware issue and it's not a deal breaker by any means. It is just a bit of an annoyance whenever I do glance down and look at it.

There are definitely some improvements for bigger handed users compared to the original Naga/Naga Epic and the texture of the mouse feels very comfortable in the hand but just be aware if you are buying this as a replacement/upgrade to the original Naga that it will take some time getting used to and the only thing about this mouse that is keeping the Naga name is the Razer logo along with the 12 button keypad. It really doesn't feel much like the original Naga/Naga Epic but it is not necessarily a bad thing. It's not a definite good thing either though.

Overall, it does the job and I like it for what I need it for, which is MMO games. I wouldn't suggest getting this as your main mouse though, only as a mouse to use for MMO games or MOBAs if you like using the keypad instead of moving your fingers around more on the keyboard. I think if they improve the ergonomics mouse 1 and 2 by giving them more of slight grooves your fingers rest in, ditch the sharp lips on both outside parts of the mouse buttons and maybe make sure all of the keypad buttons have an angle that feels evenly distributed for comfort (rather than having some buttons be flat and some having a more aggressive angle) then I would say this would pretty much be a 5/5. However, the improvements mostly are in the button sizes and click feeling of the keypad. If it weren't for the pleasant texture covering the majority of the mouse, I wouldn't feel comfortable suggesting this to people. Although I'm not entirely sure the texture of the mouse, alone, is worth it anyway.

Not the worst mouse you could buy, of course, but I think some big steps should be taken in improving this in the next updated model of the mouse that will inevitably come at some point.

Edit: After using this for some time, the issues of not reaching the 1, 2 or 3 buttons have been solved by my grip changing over time from the muscle memory I have with my previous Naga, which was the original Epic. However, I still feel as though the buttons should have a better angled position, the scroll wheel is still pretty off-color from most colors that show on the numbers, themselves and the logo lighting. Essentially, everything I had a problem with beyond having an issue reaching 1, 2 and 3 buttons on the top row have been solved after using this mouse for a while.",neutral
2274,"Finally, a game comes along that allows us to control Godzilla, fight epic battles with gigantic Toho monsters, and smash cities to rubble. Naturally, the game's big appeal is to Godzilla fans. Will fans be disappointed? Possibly, but if you're like me, we'll take whatever slice of delicious Godzilla-cake we can get.
Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters allows you to control one of eleven monsters: Godzilla, Godzilla 2000, Rodan, Mechagodzilla, King Ghidorah, Destroyah, Gigan, Anguirus, Megalon, Orga, and Mecha-King Ghidorah. If you were hoping to get your hands on Mothra, you're out of luck here, my friends. Mothra only makes random appearances throughout the game, [giving] herself out to whoever is the first to snatch the Mothra pick-up. I found this to be a little disappointing.
You can fight your way through 8 different arenas including Seattle, San Francisco, London, Tokyo, Osaka, Monster Island, and an alien Mother Ship. Perhaps you're wondering how come the likes of New York City and Paris didn't make it into the mix. Who wouldn't love to stomp out the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower? Unfortunately, these cities are nowhere to be found.
The monsters in the game look fantastic, very close to their movie counterparts. Their moves are also appropriate to the character, though at times, it seems like your giant monster moves frustratingly slow. Miss a few times with a Godzilla-tail smack, and you'll get my drift. Rodan can fly. Megalon can burrow under the ground, come up from underneath, and fling your monster around town like a pepperoni pizza. Naturally, Godzilla's asset is his strength. The developers did a great job at creating the monsters right down to their trademark screams.
The cities don't look quite as fantastic as the monsters. They're more or less the same: big and little rectangles to knock over, with a few differences. For instance, Seattle boasts the space-needle (get your firebreath and watch it burn!). Also, the cities aren't that big. Explore a little and before you know it, you'll be smacking against the green wall that limits how far you can travel. The monster who does the most damage to surrounding buildings will have the military to deal with. Much like the movies, their missiles have little effect. The worst the military can do to you is freeze you, giving your enemy some extra time to get a few attacks in.
The controls are relatively easy; there's a kick button, hit button, strong attack button, jump, run, and the special move button for your fire breath, sonic scream, or whatever else. The story mode gets repetitive; you're basically beating up monsters to unlock the next one on your list. But it can still be fun as you figure out different ways to off your opponent. Should you stamp him out with a rage attack or pick him up and toss him into a skyscraper? Hmm!
Winning the game comes down mostly to the pick-ups placed randomly throughout the city, adding just a small dose of strategy as you attempt to get to these pick-ups before your enemy does. Get the Mothra pick-up and she'll show up and blast your opponent. If the other monster gets to her first... well, Mothra is a dirty, dirty backstabber.
Some people have compared this game to Super Smash Bros Melee. This game is definitely not SSBM. There aren't as many options, levels, or characters to choose from. Still, Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters has its own merit. I mean, where else can you actually be Godzilla? While the game has its flaws (and there are more than a few), there's still something that makes me giddy every time I light an opponent on fire with that atomic breath.",neutral

I can see myself playing a full season because the game is fun and realistic. I think I'll get tired of the commentary. I hope they don't repeat themselves each game.

The game is loaded w/ stats which I love. It saves everything to your profile.
The HR derby was disappointing. The pitches come in rapid fire. You throw your arm out trying to swing..and sometimes there's a delay on your swing and then all of a sudden it starts swinging for you.
Nothing special happens when you win..I like the Wii sports one better.

The game just locked up on me..I don't know why..but i coudln't even reset the wii. I had to unplug it from the wall!

2278,"I might catch some flak for this, but I did not enjoy this game. The campaign has been applauded for it's gritty, realistic depiction of the war. Frankly, the term ""realistic"" is used very loosely. Every WW1 veteran is dead, who the hell did they ask? Anyways, I found the campaign to be somewhat enjoyable. However, it was very short, I managed to beat all of the campaigns on Veteran difficulty (the hardest) within a day. Even Call of Duty can boast a more difficult challenge than that. The multiplayer is also very laggy in my experience. I've been running around in a trench a few times only to have my body magically appear on a hillside riddled with bullet holes - with no trench in sight. Maybe I just have a NAT incompatibility with their servers, but I have been wholly unable to play this competitively since I bought it.

Like with all Battlefield games, the games can be quite protracted. This is actually markedly worse in the MP Campaigns, there multiple battles take place one after another, with each army having multiple attempts. These games can easily last a few hours, and at the very least occupy an hour unless one side gets absolutely slaughtered. Despite my gripes with this game, there are simply no other games in the shooter genre that are even worth a damn at the moment - so Battlefield 1 wins by default and frankly that's sad.",negative

2283,"I not going to be a nerd and write a 500 page novel but ill try and keep it short and to the point. This game is good, but not amazing as it could have been. The play style is very hard to get use to even if you were incredible in previous versions. This game is way harder than earlier years and I have been playing on World Class forever.. The A.I. is really, really, really amazing to play against. I normally love a challenge but the defending in this game is terrible and completely frustrating. Even if you see someone get a through pass and are there in time you have be lucky to intercept that ball. On headers when the ball comes towards you and another player, you might get it... its not easily given to you anymore. Players mess up, and balls are not as easy to control like in previous generations. Im not saying thats a bad thing, Im just saying its a LOT more intricate to play. I don't recommend this to any children or kids trying to play soccer for the first time on Playstation because they will get frustrated and hate soccer, it's really hard to score. That would suck for all of us, because we need young generations of soccer fans in the U.S.. However this game looks and feels amazing if I could only master its difficult/sensitive controls. Balls that I set up beautifully for goals are struck way to high and all over the place with minimum effort and the buttons are super sensitive as far as shooting goes. On the other hand the passing isn't.. Like to pass 20 yards you need to hold down the pass button longer than previous titles. Another issue is the goalies taking forever to kick a damn goal kick.. it literally takes at least 20 seconds each time, real annoying. But anyway Ive said my peace and just wanted to drop some knowledge on my experiences. Don't get me wrong I am still addicted but hopefully the computer  becomes easier as I break in my skills on Professional! LOL. Good luck gamers.",neutral
2284,Not as well done as Wolfenstein: The New Order.  The introduction of the zombies should have been done at an earlier chapter.

2285,Good game for this console. Worth collecting.,positive
2286,"I loved Resistance: Fall of Man but hate this game (note-I have not finished the single-player mode, I got halfway through and quit out of frustration). Why? While Resistance: FOM was original, strategic and exciting, this game is a boring, frustrating copycat FPS. The only ways this game has been enhanced are the graphics and multi-player.

Let's start with the good, shall we? The graphics are GREAT. They're truly beautiful. Everything looks realistic, even the arms and legs of your teammates. There have also been a few, small gameplay improvements. 1) Your teammates are more effective. They died very early on in the missions in RFOM. 2) You can now use the Auger more effectively because you can see, in limited fashion, through walls while using it. 3) Some of the new weapons are quite cool. The plasma cannon and Marksman are two of my favorite new additions.

I have to admit that I don't much care for multi-player in FPS games. If you play this online and find decent people to play with or against, it won't be half bad.

Now comes the bad and there's a lot of it. The health system from the first game has been replaced by a Call of Duty style rip off mode, in which there is no health bar. Instead, the screen flashes red if you take a hit and you must take cover to regenerate health. Other problems are noticeable as the game goes along. A particularly annoying features is that in many missions, there are simply tons of enemies. None of them are particularly hard to kill, but there will be hundreds in some cases and they ALL will make a beeline to you. They don't even see your teammates, it's completely bizarre. This problem did not exist in RFOM. The scenery is also overly bright and cheery. Gone is the dark look and feeling of dread from the first game. Also missing is the time consuming searching around a level to find the switch you need to continue. Some people didn't like that about the first game, but I did. It was a nice break from non-stop shooting.

The insanely high number of one-hit kills is a large part of what makes this game frustrating. There are many cases where you MUST run from an enemy, because it is literally unkillable. The Chameleons are not what I'm complaining about either, they don't frustrate me at all. I'm primarily referring to the Fury and the Swarm. You just can't kill them and will constantly be one-hit killed if you don't sprint away. Nathan Hale also sounds a little different to me, am I imagining things? Despite supposedly being on the brink of becoming a Chimera, he sounds the same. Furthermore, the game really suffers without any narration. There are also subtle little changes I hated, such as not being able to view intel documents you've just acquired without pausing the game. You'll also notice that gone are the missions where you can drive/pilot a tank, stalker or the like. That was really a fun feature in the first installment and makes this game feel too repetitive. Even the change in music was bad. When you die, you'll hear something that sounds like a miswritten theme for the epic Shogun, not a sci-fi based shooting game.

Despite it all, perhaps the worst feature is the ability to only carry two guns/weapons at once. I understand that techically adds realism, but what other part of this game is real? The imaginary guns or the virus that turns humans into alien-like creatures? It's excessively frustrating because you'll have to constantly drop a weapon you know, without a doubt, you'll want back later on.

Bottom line: If you want a good-looking, generic shooting, you'll love this game. But if you loved RFOM and want more of it, avoid this game like the plague.",negative
2287,"I am a huge fan of Tim Schafer and his games but truth be told I am a little disappointed in this game. To be more precise i have a problem with one integral mechanic of this game. The characters, story, environments, and adventure elements are wonderful and are definitely good stuff. The problem: His RTS segments. They are segments that you have to play to progress the story, and I found myself absolutely loathing these segments. It is also the sole mechanic of the multiplayer portion of this game as well.

Do i want a brutal legend 2? Absolutely Yes.

2291,"I like the Matrix and the Matrix Reloaded, but I don't have a Matrix fan site, so I was a little hesitant to get this game. I'd heard some mixed things about it, but finally decided I was too curious not to buy it for myself.
Honestly, most of what you've heard is true. I'm still enjoying it, nonetheless! It's not mind-blowing great, but it could have been if they'd spent more time on it. Still, it was an interesting experience playing a game so closing tied in with a movie.
Specifically, I'm impressed with what they did do right with this game: The graphics are really impressive in some regards, especially the players. The cut scenes are well done; the voice work and score/sound is great and the movie clips you get are also a nice treat. The hacking utility is a neat addition that I haven't played around with much yet, and although Max Payne also utilizes bullet-time very well, Max doesn't run up the walls and do back flips. He doesn't do half of what these characters will do with just a little practice. All of the nifty moves in the Matrix from the wall-walk to the shooting cartwheel can be done. My favorite is when you fly through the air, spinning and shooting. The first time I managed to do that, I smiled and said, ""Okay, that was cool.""
However, that being said, they could have done a lot better. The driving sequences are pathetic with a capital P! Switching between hand-to-hand fighting and shooting is somewhat annoying, but not as annoying as the first-person mode that's difficult to get out of quickly. Furthermore, your aim in the game is absolutely horrid unless you use Focus, and even then it's not stellar. It uses auto-aim and it's absurd! If you come from the FPS world,  you'll be really annoyed and probably want to stick with hand-to-hand fighting. That was my biggest frustration and I can't for the life of me understand why they don't allow us to aim for ourselves??? It's really not that difficult.
Also, the game is also a bit glitchy, so make sure you download the patch! It's worth the download time if you have a slow connection.
All that being said, I'm still glad I own it and even though it's not perfect and doesn't live up to its potential, I don't feel like I got ripped off like I did after I played Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring-another rush job. I'll keep this one and probably play it again from time to time.
If you're considering buying this for the Matrix fan in your family, do so-they'll love it, just make sure their PC meets the system requirements and they have access to the Internet so they can download the patch.",neutral
2292,"That's how long it lasted. June 2014 to August 23rd 2014. Now I can't move my character to the right without the character dashing, and it sometimes fails to ""down back"" when the character is on the right hand side. In other words it is now useless.

It was okay up until that point.  I have no big complaints other than its short life span.

* All 8 buttons could fit in my right hand. No, I'm not kidding.
* I would often hit FA by accident (in SF v2012 and USF4)
* Very light, so the base sometimes lifts a little during game play

Responsiveness and such was alright through its very short life.  No real complaints other than the buttons are very close together so I never did get over hitting accidental button combinations.  If you pressed a button then things happened, unlike some other cheap sticks that I had owned.

The base (that blue-ish box) would occasionally lift during game play. It's not going to stay where you put it.  For example the right hand side would sometimes lift a little off of the desk when I would try to dash to the left, thus throwing off the inputs.  It didn't happen all the time, but often enough that it's worth mentioning.

But eh, that's like 3 months tops before it wore out and I have not been playing every day. I'm pretty casual or I wouldn't have got this stick in the first place.

2298,"Dirt 2 is a progressive racing game.  As you win races, you earn unlocks which enable you to race on
more tracks, buy more cars, have more liveries, horns, dashboard icons etc.

The physics are pretty good.  I rate the physics engine 4 out of 5 stars.

Breaking is fine but switching to reverse (brake pedal) seems to be a bit too fast.

The force feedback isn't that bad but it doesn't mimic the steering wheel in the virtual cockpit that well.
When running over a rock, the force feedback doesn't jerk your wheel as a real wheel would. You will
notice this when your vehicle lands from a jump, there's no jolt to the wheel when the front end of
your vehicle lands on the track.  When you're air born, the wheel will be loose like a real wheel would be
giving you the illusion of catching air.

Most of the time your steering wheel will rattle back and forth.  There is tention in the wheel too like in
a real car.  Bottom line is, not enough time/care was taken to ensure an accurate simulation of what a
steering wheel would do in an off road environment.

I find the 3-d menu system to be a waste of time to develop.  Had Codemasters refrained from designing
such an elaborate 3-d menu environment, they could have spent more time on filling in the pot holes in
other areas of the program.

While racing, the other drivers will talk to you if an event arises.  Some of the dialog is cheesy
enough you'll question their IQ levels, especially after a race.  They have that, ""surfer-dude"" mentality.

Dirt 2 is just above Grid with regards to sophistication.  Need for Speed: Shift is above both when it comes
to physics and realism.

When you race a while with Dirt 2, you will realize the reason why it debut at $37 US when it was released.

My system specs:

AMD FX-62 @ 2.8 Ghz (dual core)
8800GT graphics
Samsung 2443 - 24"" (Dirt 2 runs at 1920 x 1200)
2 gig Corsair in dual channel
ASUSTEK M2N32 SLI DELUXE
Logitech G25 steering wheel
XP Pro 32bit SP3

Dirt 2 runs great on my system, very smooth.

Don't get me wrong, Dirt 2 is fun to play, but its the little things it lacks that bring it down.
Codemasters needs to buckle down and raise the level of sophistication in their software.  They need to
lean more toward simulation and distance themselves from economy-class arcade-style racing software.
Give us the good stuff!

Be sure to defrag after installing Dirt 2 and reboot after defragging.
Then run Dirt 2.

2302,"There's a good game lost somewhere in the maze of often-boring puzzles and confusingly huge map areas that is 'Primal'. An excellent, original storyline, likeable characters and a good control system can't save it from its flaws, however, and unfortunately this game never gets past Mediocre.
In terms of general atmosphere and game-environment the closest comparison I can make is with 'Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver'. Like LOK, Primal has an involving, gothic storyline, and lush, detailed areas to explore. The addition of a 'Buddy' system in Primal is also a welcome change, particularly since you can change between Jen (the protagonist) and Scree, her gargoyle companion, at any time. Similar to LOK, the game employs a Warp-Gate system because of its vast size, and to a point, this also works will, becuase the map system is so good. The graphics are sumptuous and the sound and voice acting is top-notch.
So far, so good.
Where Primal fails is in its over-ambition. It's a huge, sprawling game, and the first half of it is full of dangerously-difficult enemies and confusing arenas. This is remedied somewhat by the inclusion of a save-anywhere feature but I defy all but the most dedicated players to complete Primal without resorting to a wlakthrough. Also, because the difficulty levels are so steep (until Jen gains any kind of power worth mentioning) the enemies are sparse, and this is somewhat boring. The puzzles are plentiful, and none are too difficult, but a few more bad guys to waste would have been a great addition. Technically, there are some minor glitches, but in a game of this size, it's no big deal.
I can really only recommend Primal to people who love a good story and are willing to put up with some very dull gameplay to hear it. It's a beautiful, original game with some excellent qualities, but sadly can't compare to LOK in terms of action or interest.",positive
2303,"Guess what, Microsoft?  We don't all live in McMansions with 100 sq ft living rooms or tricked out gaming basements.  I've got about 25 sq ft to play in, and while it's doable for one person, I would like to play with friends at some point.

I hoped my experience would be better than others when I started with Child of Eden, and I seemed to be playing better and even beat the level with the Zoom in place.  Then I switched to Adventures and was excited when the setup screen placed me in the ""best"" zone rather than the ""good.""  However, it turned out to make the game itself absolutely unplayable -- my avatar's hand jittered so much I could barely hold it in place for menu selections, and my character jumped and contorted itself all over the screen even when I was standing still, so zero motor control.

These are the only two games I own, but based on this sampling I'm very disappointed in the Zoom.  I'll hold onto it for when my friends join me just in case, but I suspect I'll have better luck just mounting my sensor higher when my wall mount arrives.  It would be nice if Microsoft would do something to accommodate the small (sarcasm) population of apartment dwellers in America.

UPDATE:  Last night I actually took the time to recalibrate the sensor with the Zoom in place.  This has made a world of difference.  I won't go so far as to say it improves tracking of just one person necessarily, but I'm assuming will matter when I want to play with a friend.  Might be worth a try if you can pick it up cheap.",positive
2304,"Having read all of the negative reviews before I brought the game I was a little nervous.  I was to find that these fears were groundless the game is fantastic.  The races and classes have their own set of strength and weaknesses and the quests are challenging.  Although to have a balanced perspective the monsters are reparative beyond belief.

So you could rightly ask why am giving the game three stars?  Three words Blizzard Customer Service.  It is godawful.  I realize that this is a game that many people play and that the servers have to be updated from time to time.  I have been playing the game for a week now (7 days) and the servers have been down 8 hours a day for 3 of those days.  When the servers do come back online nothing works correctly and so they are forced to take them down again a few days later and the cycle repeats itself.

Overall-Fantastic game but I don't recommend that you buy it if you want good customer service and servers that actually work.
Remember how long we had to wait for the Orc campaign on Frozen Throne?  I rest my case.",positive
2305,"I feel like the product is not worth the price.

I love officially that this is an officially licensed product and I love the idea behind it, but I feel like it is cheaply constructed and will ultimately not protect the amiibo cards very well.

The pages are bound too tightly and as you fill up your album it will become harder to flip pages without causing damage to the innermost amiibo cards.

It has been difficult for me putting away cards in the innermost slots and even more difficult to remove them for use.

It is a cute product, and I did buy the albums for the four card series available at the moment. I just wish the design was thought through better, like having rings inside instead or having a larger margin between the pins and the seams of the card sleeves.

For these being $25 I feel like the quality should be much higher. Definitely not the Nintendo item quality I am used to.",positive
2306,"I really enjoy this game, I think they could have done better, some of the driving chases just seem a bit silly.  I enjoy the more tactical work he is required to do.  However, I ran into a glitch and I went online and found there are others who had the same problem where you get totally stuck and cannot move forward at all.  I played 2 nights in a row thinking I did something wrong before I looked up a walkthrough online and found out it was just a glitch in the game.  One I followed the instuctions, I was finally able to move on so watch out for that.  It's right after you go up in a watch tower with a sniper rifle, then enter a wharehouse to protect Madsen which as soon as you enter there should be a lot of men coming in, my problem was only 1 guy or other people say no men at all, if that happens then you hit the glitch because a lot of men should come rushing in.  The instructions I followed are as follows:

Turn on your PS2 is turned off with game and memory card in, then load the game (it should be at 4:28. If its not, see NOTE below).  When the cut scene with Jack and Tony begins remove the memory card and the ""Warning, memory card removed  Use save game option to manually save progress & re-enable autosave?""  Press X for OK and re-insert the memory card, then watch the cut scene.  The ""Previously on 24"" dialog box will appear, press X.  then play the game as usual.  If done correctly, many men will enter.  After you complete the mission, make sure you save it.

NOTE: If your memory card is at 4:41.  Go restart the mission and do a save during the cut scene. You will overwrite 4:41 and be back at 4:28.

It helped me and if it happens to you, believe me, you will be glad you read this because I sure was.",negative
2307,"Pretty good. Better that 2, not as good as 1. The battles are smaller, usually 2-5 guys vs your team, so there's no real reason for tactics. Huge world to explore, but it gets repetitive after awhile. Game is just too limiting. Limited to 8 abilities on your bar, limited in your skill trees, each class is very limited in what gear they can. No duel wielding warriors or armor-wearing mages in this game, it's strictly by the book, and the book is small. Feels more like an action game than an RPG. Graphics are very nice, as is the story, sound and voice acting. If only it had more freedom for skills, builds, armor and tactics, it could have been a legend.",positive

2309,"I picked this up down the street used for around 6 bucks.  That's about what it's worth.  It's just a boring shooter.  I mean, back in the day, when 3-D graphics were new, ""Quake"" was just awesome.  It was the game to beat.  But these days - with every single game being some form of 3-D immersion, the coolness of Quake has long since vanished.
-
It's a boring shooter.  I didn't think any of the weapons, or their subsequent upgrades, were that good.  I rarely used the top gun - that dark matter one - it's just weak.  So many other games have had so many cooler and better weapons.  The graphics are fine - but what game isn't these days?  I felt the game was far too difficult.  There are so few health paks around, you die all the time.  I got pretty frustrated with it and looked up the cheat codes online and blew through it in under a week.  It just wasn't engaging or rewarding enough to fight through waves of aliens or zombie-people or whatever to play it as-is.  It did have a bit of a dark side to it, which was neat.  But this game is, at the outset, utterly forgettable.",positive
2310,"The headphones rock! Good feel, even though it looks as if they had big headed Ppl in mind, the fit is snug, well see how that lasts. The sound quality I'd put at 6/10, the sound is not bass heavy, but sits in the bass eq, meaning sounds that are normally sharp or have a high shimmer,  get lost due to the eq response of the headphones, again not awesomely bass heavy, just dark sounding. Now for the adapter it comes with, it's not the upgraded turtle Beach adapter that goes by the ""earforce audio plus"" which is very disappointing because from the picture and description, you would think that's what your gonna get. It's pretty much the same minus 2 key features, adjustable noise gate, and game audio presets. Although the sound enhanced bass booster sounds nice, I really wanted the noise gate, so to be clear this thing rocks just wasn't what I was looking for",positive
2311,"If you have control freeks and are looking to get this controller. DONT GET IT. Unless you can afford to take it apart and replace the thumb sticks.

No joke, I have the Xbox One Vortex and I Can't get them to fit my analog sticks its agervating. Just spent $40 on this controller and it doesn't even work with my $20 accessories. (I don't know about squidgrips) but don't get it if you like control freeks.

One thing I should mention however, Mine did not come with a mini usb cable. It says ""WIRED XBOX ONE CONTROLLER"" yet it had no cable when I unboxed it. So its very misleading. Technically to be fair, it is a wired controller because you can't use it wirelessly (meaning to place to insert batteries)

Just so disappointed as a 360 fan of this series, for the Xbox one version to be so bad.

2319,"This joystick has a lot of potential for its price and feature set, particularly the dual throttle.  I suspect that the stick could satisfy a lot of middle-of-the-road sim pilots, but I just couldn't keep it around because of the flimsiness of construction.  It may be that I had a flawed unit, but the stick was noticeably creaky in use and felt like it'd probably break in one way or another within a few months.

Aside form that: the stick needs a bit more reinforcement when pushed away from the user as the base just doesn't stay put.  This could probably be alleviated by some friction tape and enhancing the base with a wider plate.

However, I want to applaud Mad Catz for their customer service.  Though I am unsatisfied with this particular product, they were stellar in addressing any and all concerns I had.  Much thanks to them and please consider another of their products if this one doesn't sound worthwhile.",positive
2320,"Much darker than the first game, this sequel takes place not long after the events of the first. Revan has vanished, the Jedi have nearly been wiped out, and you are the galaxy's only hope. I won't lie, I found the characters in this game to be even more plausible than in the first incarnation. They are much more flawed (the backstories of some are literally not for children). There seems a greater sense of urgency in this title with the battles being larger and much more action filled. There is also an excellent wrinkle added to the game in your ability to now not only influence your character's path between the light and dark side but also those in your party. Making the right choices help to unlock the mysteries of those traveling with you as well as other points in the game. My only quibble is the ending. It is too ambiguous.

2328,"Well, first let me tell you that I have been waiting for Red Faction ever since I heard about it six months ago. The ability to punch holes through anything? A submarine and plane [flying machine... whatever]? And a good story? Well, needless to say I was engaged, as nearly every FPS fan was. But the Red Faction they promised is very different from what they released. Sure, Geo-Mod technology lives up to the hype, except you can use it almost nowhere. And the engine is complete trash. I almost died from laughter watching guys run around [their legs look like a cheap cartoon that is missing a couple of animations] and speaking [the mouth animation is worse than Half-Life]. And the vehicles are nice, but you hardly get any [the submarines are very cool though]. If this game had been released with the Q3TA engine [Quake III: Team Arena] with the Geo-Mod tech tied in, it would have been a winner. Now it is just a game to play for a couple hours, not really a Half-Life killer or a legend. If this game had had a bit more polish, it would have been the best.

Graphics (8/10) - The environments look very lush and colorful. From what I've seen, the game has none of the typical warping PS1 games are known for. It still holds up well today.

Sound (6/10) - Mostly average tunes here. Nothing I'd demand to put on my iPod, but it gets the job done and fits the game well.

Gameplay (8/10) - The game controls well even though you have to use the D-pad, since the analog support didn't exist when the game came out. The game itself is a challenging, fast-paced platformer that moves fairly linearly. It's a lot of fun.

Overall (7/10) - This is a solid game by Naughty Dog, and a great start to an awesome series.",positive
2335,"Despite the ""worst camera in the world"" and the frustrating save system I still enjoy this game and I have played it through a few times.

The problem with the game is that the camera system is so frustrating most gamers will quit long before they realize the game has tough battles,  great graphics and atmosphere, and a cheesy sci-fi story. Ok, so its not all good news :)

The camera is not the only problem, I felt the save system was a bit difficult to deal with as well. The problem is that you save, then go well into enemy territory, make some progress and withing an inch of your death you finish off a tough mini boss battle only to find there is no where to save. So you have to go back a few rooms. But when you do, a single dino gets a very cheap shot in that was almost impossible to avoid and you die. So you either have to use up one of you expensive saves or do the whole thing over. After that happens a few times you want to throw the controller.

But I still played on. Why? I just really like the games atmosphere, music, and action when the game got it right. The puzzle solving is also quite good since it involve transforming the ship into different formations. Its like playing inside a huge transformer. Very cool.

If you have the patience and skill, the game can be quite rewarding. Just keep in mind it takes at least a few hours to get used to the wonky camera and combat system. I would not pay a lot for the game but as a bargain bin game you might just be surprised. But you may just be frustrated too.

EDIT: I totally agree with the other review here that stated that playing on easy is a good way to lighten the frustration with the game and its a good idea. I have been gaming for 30+ years as well and I always play on the default difficulty but with this game I would highly recommend easy for the first run through.",negative

I'd have to say a lot better than the turtle beach headsets. The only thing wrong with my Triton Axpro's was that the chat piece on the headset did not work properly. My friends said that they could hear me talk but i sounded muffled. Tried everything to fix the problem but could not fix it. Read some reviews online and other people had the same problem. I was very disappointed. I ended up ghetto rigging my Triton's with a regular xbox headset so that it would work. I ended up keeping them but If you don't want a whole bunch of wires and not taking the chance of getting a faulty Triton headset i'd stick with Turtlebeach but the sound is Sooooooo much better on the Triton's.

2341,"Orcarina of Time, this game is not. With that said its not nessecarily a bad thing. I am all for Nintendo trying out new ideas and honestly this game is pretty fun, pretty replayable, but in the same breath, also not very memorable.

This game can be infact played by yourself however that is not the way Nintendo recommends it. Unfortunately I don't have many friends willing to shell out 40 bucks on this game so most of my multiplayer progress has been played through miserable online connections. Now let's forget the lag and dropped connections. Some people take the game serious and want to genuinely complete puzzles together. I'm sure one day I'll come across said players. I hate using this word but TriForce brings out the best of the best of Trolls. And when somebody in your party messes up, guess what? You all pay the price!

So right now I'm currently playing solo, which is not as fun but I have a better chance of actually finishing the game this way. I feel there were a lot of opportunities Nintendo missed out on that could have made a ""good"" game a great game.

This isn't the Worst Zelda game, but it's not even in the top ten of the best. I would say wait to buy it when it's on Sale but every Nintendo fan knows. Mario, Zelda, and Pokemon are three franchises that never go down in price.

Rent it first; if you like it then shell out the money. Honestly this game will be very hit or miss for some people. With that said thank you for reading my review and please recommend if helpful!",positive

2351,"The Playstation 3 needs some good sports titles. There isn't much right now, pretty much Madden, NBA 2k7 and of course NBA o7. NBA 07 was developed in-house by Sony. The series has been relesed on both the PS2 and PSP with only average reviews. Thankfully, this version does not suffer the same fate, it's a good game of hoops even though you have a much better choice with NBA 2k7. But if you like basketball like I do, you might want to consider this one too, just because it's a different experience.

What stands out is the graphics. The graphics are top notch, and I feel in most ways, it's a better looking game than 2k7 due to the incredible player models and stadium details. In true 1080 HD, the game is really sweet too look at. It really struts some of the power of the PS3 has to offer. Smooth crisp animations, nice player models, terrific reflections on the court, realistic stadiums and excellent use of vibrant colors and dripping sweat to boot! The player models are not perfect. The players look to sweat a little profusely and when this happens, they look a bit ""manequinish"", is that a word? I guess you can say they resemble a zombie in a round about sort of way. But you'll only notice on replays, timeouts and closeups, so it's only a minor gripe. But the players faces look very much like their real counterparts and they even got the hair down to a tee.

Gameplay wise, I would describe it as a 70% sim and 30% arcade feel. The gamep plays at an amazing fast pace and there is lot of scoring. The defense A.I. still needs some work, I noticed too many easy holes to the basket as my computer controlled teammates do not seem to help out in the lane when they should. One thing also that really bothered me was that very annoying shot meter. It's difficult to perfect it, as it seems to want just that, ""perfection"" to make a shot. Luckily, the shot meter thing can be disabled,so if you have problems like me making open jumpers, just turn it off. Other problems are with player fatigue issues. I noticed players being tired really doens't seem to affect them when their still oncourt. I've had guys below 50% and they were still moving fast and making shots on the court like they were fully rested from the bench. This is certainly an issue if you want realism and if you play online as substitutions are basically not needed. They need to patch this up.

Ouch. You would think of the slick presentation with TNT by it's side, you would think we would have a great tv style presentation. Well, good stat screens and cool TV replays are nice, but where the heck is my commentary? NBA 07 is lacking any commentary whatsoever. All you hear is the P.A. announcer. This is a major bummer and considering this is a next gen title, leaving out commentary is a big no-no.

Online play for the most part seems to be pretty smooth, I only notice a few laggy games, of course a lot depends on your connection. The modes are pretty bareboned, typical Season, Exhibition and a few mini-game which are actually very fun. The NBA Replay mode lets you replay games from the past week (in real life) and alter the ending. It's a good experience and with so many scnerios each week from the NBA, this mode is fun and will keep you busy. There are no deep franchise modes or the ""The life"" mode offered in the PS3 version, which is a bit disappointing. You would think a full priced NBA game for the PS3 would be loaded, but it still seems to a bit lacking.

Overall, I really liked NBA 07. The on-court gameplay is very good and is a good change up from 2k7. It's a game anyone can jump into and most will have fun with it. A few issues in the gameplay and lacking modes keeps it from being a must have. IF you only want to get one game, I would say NBA 2k7 is your best bet, it's still the best basketball game on the market.",positive
2352,"I actually really like these stylus, unfortunately they are not as tough as they look. I bought a pack and shared it with my son who also have a 3DS and a WiiU. It was great and feels comfortable on the hand while holding the controller and they stylus at the same time. This is a big thing for me because switching back and forth to grab a stylus in the middle of a game play is annoying and critical. This actually allows you to hold the controller or the 3ds while holding it in your fingers comfortably. The only problem is, my son had just been playing with it a day and the tip broke off so I had to give him another one. One of the stylus, (the one I was using) dented immediately right after I accidentally flipped it with my finger and hit the controller. I ended up buying another pack (although there was still the pink one, but of course it's pink so we don't use it. :) )  But I bought another pair because I love the way it feels on your finger while holding the controller at the same time. I can only give it 3 stars for the sturdiness.",negative

2354,"I played many hours of the first Godfather and enjoyed almost every second of it. The thought of receiving upgrades when controlling a racket sounded great in practice, but didn't benefit me as much as I would have liked. Here are a few of my other observations from the game:

* Weaken rival families
I like this addition. Go through and use your special execution styles to take out key players in your opponent's crew. In some cases this was as easy as walking up to the person and using the garrote, while other required much more finesse and some luck (hitting someone between the eyes). The favor system was pretty lame, in my opinion. It usually went like this...
Walk up to person, talk, take job. Either do job or search for another favor. At one point my map had all the red indicators for favors. I totally lost track of how many mafia members I had gained access to by completing the favors. I don't think this was that well thought out.

* Dictate family members
I'm torn on the skills aspect of the game. I understand the need for it, but I think it was underdeveloped. This could have been a more important aspect of everything, but it almost seemed like more of an afterthought than anything. By that I mean you could go through the entire game without using any of the skills if you didn't want to. It helped on several occasions, but I think it should have played a more integral part in things. Another addition is when you control where family members protect/defend. You can't be everywhere at once, so being able to assign or send people elsewhere helped out in times of need.

* Gun upgrades
Instead of buying upgrades like in the first one, you mysteriously stumble upon them at different points, most of the time in boss houses. Both sides have their drawbacks, but I would rather know when and where I can upgrade rather than missing something and having to search high and low for it (that's just me). Luckily most of them were pretty obvious, but there was at least one where I had to look it up and it turns out I walked right by it because it didn't look like anything special.

* Length of the game
This was a much shorter game than the first. I decided to work on all the rackets and had near completion when I finished one mission and a large number of my businesses were taken from me. This upset me to no end and made me wonder why I'd spent all the time taking them over. Also, once you finish the main story there's not much else to do. Sure you can run around with all your cool new upgrades and battle with the cops, but has no point and gets old rather quick. I was hoping for something more but it didn't deliver.

It was a good game but not without its flaws. I would suggest buying it for $10 or less or renting it for the weekend. Even better, get the original!",positive

I would recommend this game if you are a die-hard football gaming fan (madden lover, etc) - but if you are a game player more interested in immediate gratification (DoA3, NHL Hitz) like myself, I doubt you'll find this game very interesting - I didn't.

2358,"I think critics were way too harsh on this game. It's not HORRIBLE. The Sonic levels are a blast. They make the game worth the purchase if you're a die hard Sonic fan. It's just a shame about the Warehog levels though. They're such a drag. They're not fun AT ALL! You did a little bit of platforming, a little bit of puzzle solving, and a ton of brawling. The brawling gets so repetitive that you wanna kill yourself. And then there's a boss at the end of the level and if you die you usually have to reply a part of the level over again because the check point wasn't right before the boss. And I've died a lot on these levels. And it's SO ANNOYING!

If this was just a pure Sonic game, it'd be a 5 out of 5. But as is, I can only give it a 3.",negative
2359,"There's nothing like having an army of unquestioningly loyal little goblins to do your every bidding. Not that I would really know, but if its like Overlord II, I imagine it would be cool. Maybe I just want some help keeping my apartment clean.

The truth is, at its heart Overlord II is a great concept with fun, engaging gameplay. Although it is almost exactly the same as the first from a gameplay standpoint, the dynamics are still fun and clever. I don't normally like action games much, but the Overlord franchise is addictive because the game has depth, humor, and strategy.

In my opinion, your evil quest for conquest and vengence is slowed down by some problems. No, not the hippie elf animal rights activists (yes, they are actually bad guys in the game) but rather some newer elements that were poorly done.

There are parts of game that require you go control your minions and go into a ""stealth"" mission, switching the game into the minion's perspective. This is, in a word, lame. It disrupts the flow of the game with a boring, annoying mini-game mission that is so far from the Overlord style it made me cry a little. I had to actually round up some pre-schoolers, put them in color-coded uniforms, and boss them around to remember the good 'ole days of the game as I painfully advanced through the stupid minion possession missions.

In addition to the ""control a minion"" parts, the controls are still not perfect on a PC, which is perhaps just the nature of the game. You'll probably accidentally drown your whole army by accident at least once. You can bring back old minions now if you do mess up, but it'll cost you. I also wish the game would ditch the old ""checkpoint"" system of saving, because if you have to quit the game you'll have to start from your last checkpoint. It's the 21st century people, I'd like to save my game wherever I want please.

Overall, the game is a fun second installment for the franchise, but I was dissapointed with the breaks in gameplay of the ""possession"" missions, some minor control challenges, and a collection of other, somewhat minor issues like a dumb AI, loading screens when transporting to other parts of the tower, and there not being enough baby seals to club. Now, to get my minions to clean my apartment...",negative

2361,Controller works well but had very bad marks around buttons. I went for the cheaper version though. Anything over $15 should be pretty nice.

2362,"XIII sets itself apart by delivering something truly special: a comic book-styled FPS.

The game's 37 missions are a mix of run-and-gun mayhem and stealth. If you slow down to a tiptoe, you can hear others' movements, which appears onscreen as illustrated visuals like tje words ""tap tap"" that reveal enemy positions around corners and through walls. Cut-scenes unfold in mind-boggling swell of animated panels.

If XIII has a major flaw, it is the savegame system. Inexplicably, you can permanently save only between levels. The boss fights are also ridiculous. Why I have to fire repeatedly on old men without armor to kill them when I can kill soldiers with one or two shots is beyond my comprehension.

However, this game has a lot of atmosphere and if you are a fan of the Belgian comic book, you owe yourself to try that game.",positive
2363,"KOTOR was one of the best rpgs ever made. With the release of KOTOR2: Sith Lords, Obsidian tried to recreate the magic that Bioware had created with the original. This is where they succeeded on some things but failed miserably on others. For one, the epic storyline from the first game was better fleshed out and was just better overall. After playing through this game, it took me roughly 33-35 hours to complete, i was disappointed not only with the ending but with the dumb mistakes the story writers and programers made. Play it through on light side and you will see what i mean (and darkside to some extent), which brings me to my other big complaint that playing through as a darkside character really doesnt change much this time around. The first game really felt like the decisions you made effected everything and made the game seem different, but KOTOR2 does a poor job of this and just seems rushed. The graphical improvements are laughable as it is clear that they just used the work bioware had done and created a storyline from that. All of that being said, the game was still great fun. While the storyline lacked and at the end a few things made no sense, it kept me interested and playing throughout. There really aren't many rpgs on the xbox and there are even fewer playable ones, so that takes kotor2 from a lackluster sequel to a must play for rpg fans and xbox owners. The addition of the influence system (which you can either embrace or ignore altogether) was a decent addition although i had hoped it would effect the overall storyline a bit more. The new force powers are cool but playing through with the lightside with a jedi guardian, i only used force push, heal, and destroy droid. The stances might as well have been nonexistent as well. KOTOR2 is a fun game and would be a great addition to any xbox owners library but i cant help but feel that if bioware would have made the game the quality would have been much higher.",positive

I was upset that it wasn't on the 3DS but now we have Pokemon X and Y on the way this fall for the 3DS on an international release! To sum it up Pokemon is Pokemon and not all generations appeal to everyone , maybe the next one will be everything this gen wasn't IMO.",negative
2366,"I have confirmed that this game is so totally not worth its retail price tag ($49.99 last time I was at Best Buy, I think it might be about $5.00 cheaper on Amazon). I guess I'll start with the negatives because those are easier to remember.

-There are only 30 songs total, as opposed to the previous games' 58 tracks. There are no unlockable tracks that you can buy in the store. You get the set 30 and that's it.
-Way too many obscure songs. I recognized most of the bands, but some of the songs they chose from certain bands are most definitely not their recognizable hits. Even some of the encores (which are supposed to be the super secret awesome songs that everybody knows and loves) were disappointing. Who the heck is Limozeen, anyway?
-While it's great that they got master tracks for The Warrior and I Wanna Rock (two of the better songs on the game), the master tracks on those songs fade out. Live bands don't fade out. It kind of killed my Rock Star mood when I discovered those two songs faded out. Surely they could have managed decent covers of those two songs with creative endings to compensate for the fade-out.
-Speaking of covers, I understand that the original version of Ballroom Blitz by Sweet did not come out in the 80s, but trying to throw in a cover of a crappy cover by freakin' Krokus was lame. They should have just picked a different song.
-The extras are limited. As I said, there are no extra songs to buy in the store. All the guitars you can buy in the store are the same as the guitars you can buy in GH3, as are all the skins for those guitars. The only other thing you can buy in the stores besides guitars and skins is an extra character, the Grim Ripper. There are no extra styles or outfits to buy for the characters. They have one 80s style, and that's it.
-While the playable characters were altered into 80s style clothing and hair, the stock band members were not. They all look the same as the previous GH games.
-The venues are not noticeably different. The only main change I noticed was that the venue that was the Vans Warped Tour in previous games changed to something called Rock for Safety, or something like that.
-The gameplay seems easier, which makes the lower levels somewhat boring. The only song I didn't 5-star on the first try was Seventeen by Winger on Medium, and that was more because I was distracted by something rather than the difficulty of the song. Perhaps Hard will still be difficult enough for me, but the way things have gone so far, I wouldn't be surprised if I actually try to play Expert.
-Lack of songs with female vocalists, which may just be a testament to the state of rock bands in the 80s (or ever). But still, if I'm remembering correctly there were only 3 songs out of the 30 that had female vocalists.

Now for the positives. Yeah, this list will probably be shorter, but the game is still good overall. It's just overpriced.

-It's still fun. It's Guitar Hero. It's addictive and fun, and there is really only one song I dislike enough to only play in order to advance through the levels--Krokus's cover of Ballroom Blitz. I don't mind the other songs at all and would be fine playing them multiple times if I needed to in order to get 5 stars.
-The 80s styles for the characters are pretty fun. I like the Grim Ripper's 3-D glasses. :op

Okay, yeah, definitely a short list. The game is definitely worth playing. It's just not worth buying for $50. I would suggest renting it or if you absolutely must own it, wait until you can find a really cheap used copy.",positive
2367,"Nothing beats the original, never duplicated.

2380,"The Nintendo Wii isn't even two months old, yet many gamers including myself have gotten a grasp on which types of games play well and which ones don't play so well. So far, the first-person shooter genre has been the target for a lot of controversy; some Wii gamers love stuff like Call of Duty 3 and Red Steel while others complain that the games are unplayable. I fall into the former category, and thus decided to give Ubisoft Montreal's Wii iteration of the Far Cry series a shot. Far Cry: Vengeance has its ups and downs but altogether is the most playable Wii shooter yet.

Far Cry: Vengeance won't win you over with its story. Jack Carver gets caught up with a busty arms dealer named Kade who gets him into all sorts of trouble with a crazed madman named Semeru, his mercenaries, the military, and a man in charge named Kien Do. I've never really liked Carver, even in the series' 2004 PC debut. Vengeance does nothing to change that, with poorly constructed cinemas and the worst voice acting since...well, Elebits, which came out the same day. I'll just say that December 12th, 2006 marked the day of all days for awful voice acting. As a result, I couldn't find myself caring much about the story and just wanted to shoot some thugs in the jungle.

Far Cry: Vengeance uses familiar Wii shooter mechanics but does everything better and smoother. Aiming around the screen works well and the aiming/turning ""box"" feels more natural here than in Red Steel or Call of Duty 3. Ubisoft Montreal added an extra helper by letting the player prevent the camera from turning by holding down the A button. This allows for super-precise aim and severely limits missed-shot frustrations. Jumping with the nunchuck (flick up) works well, and I personally think that reloading (C button) is much more natural than flicking (Red Steel) or pressing the super-small Minus button (Call of Duty 3). I can't say enough how much more I enjoyed playing this game just because of its intuitive controls. Ubisoft Paris and Treyarch, grab some paper and take notes

There are definitely a lot of guys to shoot, too. I am somewhat disappointed, generally speaking, that Ubisoft Montreal went away from the original game's stealth-centric style. This style, which forced the player to scope out an upcoming area with binoculars to pinpoint enemy locations and other points of interest, took more time but ultimately provided more depth. Far Cry: Vengeance is much more run-and-gun, which is still pretty fun, but admittedly shallow. As I said, there are a lot of mercs in the lengthy single-player campaign to shoot. There are also a lot of guns to use, like standard pistols and submachine guns as well as high-powered sniper rifles, chain guns, and rocket launchers. The guns are all pretty useful in their own unique ways; the pistol isn't too weak and thus is handy throughout the game while the sniper rifle allows the player to stay back and pick off thugs from afar. You'll also drive vehicles like ATVs, patrol boats, and licensed Jeep trucks (strange use of licensing, but whatever), but after a while I preferred to walk and shoot because the vehicles didn't handle as easily as they should.

Jack's predator powers, which were made familiar in the Xbox release, Far Cry: Predator, are put to good use in Vengeance. By killing a lot of enemies and busting skulls with headshots, Jack will fill up a Predatorine meter that allows him to utilize some of his powers. Jack initially unlocks a super-fast running speed that can be activated by holding down the A button. He also has a health-regenerating power, done by flicking the nunchuck to the left and the right. This was obviously the most useful power throughout the game. Soon afterward, Jack will be jumping 20 feet into the air, using enhanced senses like sight and smell, and climbing up walls with his bare hands. The predator powers are all a lot of fun to use and open up the gameplay for more possibilities. For example, there's a sequence about halfway through the game where a player is running across bridges and through the jungle surrounded by snipers. One could either take it slow and pick off the snipers with his or her own rifle or run and jump at mad speeds through the entire area to avoid their gunfire. I personally took the latter approach in this given situation 1) because I'm an awful sniper and 2) I was running low on health and didn't have enough Predatorine to regenerate my health manually.

Unfortunately, not all is smooth sailing. Despite my enjoyment of most of the game, I'll gladly tell you that Far Cry: Vengeance looks like piss. It is easily the worst-looking ""next-gen"" game I've ever seen. Nintendo can walk the ""gameplay over graphics"" line all they want, but when visual factors look like they came from the Nintendo 64 (textures) or Dreamcast (character models) era, the line has been crossed. I'm really not being sarcastic, satirical, or unfair: this is a pretty awful-looking game. The frame rate doesn't even hold up very well in some sequences, either. I've seen bugs like enemies walking into walls and tree bases floating three or four feet above the ground. What happened to the dynamic lighting and water effects, detailed character models, and pretty cinemas? What's the deal, Ubisoft? The Wii is clearly capable of visuals that are better than this. Look at games like Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Rayman: Raving Rabbids, hell, even Red Steel  This is an embarrassment. Other than feats like an impressive amount of vegetation, large levels, and the fact that the game runs without freezing, there isn't much to compliment. I'd have much rather had small levels with better graphics and effects.

The sound effects aren't much better, but they work. The music is appropriate for the surroundings, but I found it odd that intense jungle beats would sometimes play while I was simply strolling through the harmless jungle, far away from any sort of threat. And what's with the insults? Ubisoft Paris threw shockers like ""Moron "" at me with Red Steel, and I'm still hearing ""Coward "" in Far Cry: Vengeance. What's the deal? This is an M-Rated game made in 2006. I'm not asking for gracious, unnecessary amounts of derogatory swearing, but when a man is jumping 20 feet in the air towards me about to dice me up with a machine gun, the last thing I'm going to yell is, ""You are afraid of me ""

There are a few factors that will ultimately determine whether or not you enjoy Far Cry: Vengeance. First, do you like how Wii shooters handle? Second, do you like run-and-gun shooters with little to no required strategy? Third, are visuals and sound effects important in any way, shape, or form? If you answered yes, yes, and no, you'll agree with me when I say that Far Cry: Vengeance is an enjoyable game, if not a great game. Otherwise, you'll say, ""This game plays as poorly as the others,"" ""This game is shallow and stupid,"" and ""This game looks like dog crap,"" respectively. Think about it clearly: Vengeance has great shooter mechanics and a fun campaign but almost totally lacks any impressive superficial values whatsoever.",neutral
2381,"I only sort of like this game.  I get frustrated within a 1/2 hour of playing it, but then always return to it later on, for another frustrating 1/2 hour.

This game is a very standard first person shooter.  The hook is that the guy you are playing knows he is a video game character.  This is the centerpiece of the idea of the game: this guy you are playing in the game is being attacked via the game by a ""real"" guy who hates your character, for whatever reason.
So, there's some humor involved - and it's mildly funny.  But, they really should have taken it a few steps further.  The game has stereotypical villians, and they could have made them much more ridiculous and funny with just a few simple changes.  The bosses are the best in this regard.  It's the main bad guys you fight who I feel could have been stepped up a notch.
-
And it's the gaming system I find so frustrating.  It takes a surprising amount of ammo to kill anyone, unless you get a headshot.  Which isn't too hard as most of the AI just hides and pokes out, repeat - so you'll know where their head will be for and easy kill.  But many times - MANY times - you'll be focusing on what's ahead of you when out of NOWHERE bad guys will appear directly behind you and kill you.  This is utterly annoying as you have no radar and the path behind you was absolutely closed off.  Also later on, any cover you have will disappear if hit enough times by enemy bullets, and when your options for cover are limited, you're dead.  This is more frustrating than challenging.
I find the movement and cover system to be quite clunky.  And it's all these things tied together that make me give up every half hour - it's just annoying and not fun.  But I always pick it up again because I want to win it, and I like the humor of the game itself.

2. Very Very few worthwhile games and apps.
3. The fact that its always on as long as the Xbox is and is constantly watching you and hearing you is quite creepy.
4. Doesn't do enough unless you also ruyn your TV through Xbox (which I dont)
5. Doesn't come with a TV mount.

Summary:A brilliant product... If it did what it is supposed to do. It looks good, works well (when it does) and is useful in some ways but it is severely hampered by lack of games and semi functional voice recognition. Also mounting and privacy screens are an additional cost if you want them.

It's kind of let down that the last few times I've tried to play, the servers have either been full or down. usually this isn't a problem for games of it's ilk but when you take anti-piracy techniques to the extreme that these guys have it means that with down servers you can't even play the single player mode because they have stored the unit's AI information on their servers rather than locally.

2388,"How much you get out of this game is really going to depend on why you are buying it. If you are someone who does not even notice that there is a single player story to accomplish, then I don't think you will be horribly disappointed. However, if you are looking for a decent sized single player experience, you are not going to get the payoff you are looking for.

I got MoH on release day (Tuesday Oct. 12th). I popped it into my xbox at about 8:30PM and played for a couple of hours. As I write this, that was only two days ago. I played for a couple of hours yesterday morning, then again this morning for about an hour - when I finished it! I played through on the ""Hard"" setting - the most difficult option I was given. I was stunned when the game ended. I could not believe that there was literally only about 5 - 7 hours of single player story line. The bottom line is that I was left unsatisfied by the single player. What it had was good, but I just did not feel like it had enough. The challenge on the hardest setting also did not live up to my expectations. It was just too easy. Finally, the single player game felt too much as if I was on rails. I understand there is a story and they want to move you through it, but I sometimes felt I was being led by the hand a bit too much.

I then jumped on to multiplayer. I like the ability to customize your weapon. In all honesty I have only played for about an hour on multiplayer, but I liked the maps (of the two I saw). Time will tell, but clearly, this is where the payoff for the game is intended to be. One nice addition is drivable vehicles. The ""Combat Mission"" mode I played involved clearing five objectives as the aggressor or defending against that assault as the OPFOR. These played well and felt very much like a similar mode on Battlefield: Bad Company 2.  As you progress, you unlock more options for your load out. The potential variety here looks pretty amazing and I suspect that this ability to customize your in game avatar will make the game more interesting. Also in the good news column is that there is a ""Hardcore"" mode. Lets face it, there are plenty of annoying little trolls out there playing these games. I have found that heading right to the ""Hardcore"" option cuts down on those folks fast. This feature is also available for the two games I link to below. It is actually a pretty universal feature at this point.

GRAPHICS:
Nothing to write home about here. You are not going to be blown away by what you see. Frankly, the graphics look a little dated by todays standard. I noticed they used the Unreal engine and if that is what Unreal is serving up these days, it might just be time to update some code! Everything from the setting to the models of other people just don't look like what you would expect, quality wise, from a game released in 2010.

If you are just getting into first person shooters or multiplayer games of this type, there are plenty of other options that might please you more, for a lower price. Here are some suggestions:

-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Bad-Company-2/dp/B001QXNBJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Bad Company 2</a>&nbsp;- This is a good one. Huge maps, vehicles, plenty of fun! You cannot go prone in this game, which is really one of my only complaints.
-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2/dp/B00269QLI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a>&nbsp;- Smaller maps and no vehicles - but some real fun sniping. Oh, and a silenced .50 Cal sniper rifle... so you get some fantasy gaming in there as well.

Final opinion: I think this game can appeal to just about anyone in the market for this kind of game. If you are new to the genre or a die hard FPS fan, this is a decent game to get in your hands. Buy it for the multiplayer action tho, as the single player campaign will leave you hungry.",neutral
2389,"Story: The story in this game is actually entertaining and about the only reason I found to keep wanting to play through all the nonsense levels. The player takes on the role of Star Killer. A ""secret"" assassin that Darth Vader kidnapped (after killing his father) as a young child and trained him in the ways of the force to help Vader overthrow the emperor.  Of course since this is a star wars cannon (its part of the actual star wars universe i.e. George Lucas approved.) story our plucky anti-hero eventually starts to think for himself and that's when things start to kick into high gear. Story wise anyway. I'm not going to spoil the story for those who play the game or read the book (I'd say read the book even though I haven't had a chance yet.). Suffice to say that it does fill in some gaps and there are some ""so that's why that was like that moments"" along with some of the star wars twist and turns that are expected. Now on to the actual (when are the going to stop beating poor star wars to death) game play.
-----------------------------(some spoilers)
To start off any level that generally lets you run around and hit things, smash  things, fry things or some combination of the above is fun. What is not fun is having the above interrupted by annoying button sequences and go break /move that thing  to open this door so I can go fight another annoying boss that involves more button sequences.  In my opinion if they could go back and rewrite this game as a open world /sand box game (ala mercenaries 1 or along the lines of mass effect) and give me the option of figuring out how to recruit forces against the emperor and cause merry havoc along the way this would have been a much better game . Or on the other hand make it so I could play like a actual assassin and I don't know, be able to do things like the mind trick or make myself invisible or make the bad guys shoot each other. Instead the developer came up with this half polished hack and bash game that showed me occasional glimpses of what could have been.  I guess the reason I'm irritated with this game is because while I was playing it there were points where everything clicked and I actually felt like I was playing a scene out of a Star Wars movie about a conflicted dark side assassin and then I would run into one of the many bugs or game play issues and go ""why?"". On the bug front, there are many. I only ran into a few show stoppers that made me get up and restart my console. The majority are what a good QA run would have caught and are generally along the lines of clunky controls and bad hit detection. The clunky controls were obvious in the first level. Trying to actually pickup anything and aim it and throw it while dodging laser fire is darn near impossible. For some reason it was decided that the camera should lock onto what your throwing and not what you are throwing it at. In my experience that translated into forgetting about aiming and just turning yourself into a force powered tornado. Throw enough stuff and you'll hit something. Most of the bugs I ran into were the ones where the game forgot you should have died (fell off the bridge on the way to rescue Juno and the silly game just let me walk around in the flames for two minutes before I restarted the level) and the ones where for some reason I just lost control of the character and stood there until a enemy got done killing me. Also there are a lot of unnecessary (imo)button sequences in just about every mini boss and end level boss and a really *special* one on the bring down the star destroyer level. Other than that if you can slog through all the nonsense and power up your character the game does warrant a play through (or two) just to find the collectibles and unlock everything. Too sum up this is one of those games that could have been great if it hadn't been rushed out the door. There is a good game under all of the problems that came from the rush job that was done. It just takes till the second play through to see what could have been (unfortunately the second play through doesn't magically get rid of all the bugs) and hopefully if Mr. StarKiller makes it to a second game Lucas arts might skip the doughnuts and coffee instead of skipping the  QA. Would recommend to anyone who likes Star wars and action/hack an slash games with the warning that it does take at least till the second play through to really get to the meat of the combat system. M.a.c

Story: A great (if a little predictable) story set before the original story begins.
Graphics: Good. A little choppy hear and there. Nothing major that I came across
GamePlay: Above average. It is entertaining while you can run around and cause chaos, but some levels are broken up with annoying puzzles and button sequences.
Camera/control: Control can be a bit wonky. Aiming is an after thought and the auto target doesn't always work. The camera didn't cause me any problems.",negative
2390,"Ok.  This game came out in the mid 90's, but even for then, it's an average game.  Nothing stands out to make it a ""must have"" for the Star Wars fan and gamer.
Graphically, it's a step down from the old Doom days.  Characters are made of HUGE sprites--The closer you get, the more blocky they are.  Backgrounds/levels are huge, but poorly done.  Most levels are just plain boring and the colors are extremely dull looking.
The sound, out of everything, is fairly good.  Effects and voices are above that average level.  The music, though, is a disappointment.  This is a 32-bit game with an 8-bit soundtrack.  One thing in every Star Wars movie that's done well with pride is the music score.  All Star Wars games should be no different than the movies with the same score.  This game is one of those games where the music is just plain bad.
Fun value is on the average level, as well.  Where most everything is dull, the enjoyment of blasting Stormtroopers, Probe Droids, etc. is fun for every Star Wars fan.
If you enjoy first person shooters and the Star Wars movie series, then give it a try.  It's cheap money-wise, however, it's just that, as well (gameplay-wise)--cheap.",positive
2391,"A note to any official Amazon guys - you might want to merge this review set with the bundle on 360.

Okay.  Now, I'm a fan of the franchise.  I own a lot of it.  All of it, actually, and twice on 360 and PS2 for the immediate predecessor of this installment.  So, hopefully you will trust me when I say that I am a fan of the gameplay and the franchise in general in this preface.

It's kind of baffling what's happened with this game.  Neversoft has certainly recognized some of the shortcomings of its predecessor, but have somehow managed to not solve even one of those issues, and have, in fact, introduced new problems to be addressed.  I'll do this as a sort of point-by-point thing, to keep it organized:

1.  Medium-to-Hard.  In Guitar Hero 2, the jump from Medium to Hard was only slightly more enjoyable than stepping in front of a speeding bus.  The main reason this was such a problem was that the game was very, very poorly designed for getting players over that average-to-hard hump.  For one thing, the initial two difficulty settings compel you to adapt your grip on the fretboard to leave your index finger on the green button, pinky on the blue button, and keep each assigned to its place.  With the introduction of the orange button, that's no longer really a viable strategy if you want to avoid crippling the weaker side of your hand.  Additionally, in 2, upon reaching hard difficulty, the speed of the notes down the fretboard doubled, the fifth button was introduced, and chords and note orders increased in complexity.  Those three things were enough to make hard a no-go for a lot of people in principle where a gentler slope would have taken care of that.

In response, Neversoft has tried to reduce the impact of the change in difficulty by making the Medium notes move just about as fast as the Hard difficulty ones.  Unfortunately, instead of making the Medium to Hard transition easier (still very difficult because of the whole hand-training thing), it just makes the Easy to Medium transition much more jarring.  Hard is still so hard that I barely want to try it at all.

2.  Uncomfortable Play - I swear, the designers have put some of these songs together specifically to be painful for me.  Seriously - playing Knights of Cydonia I thought I was going to cripple myself.  On Medium.  These guys really need to get some bad players into the office to see if they're not making something dangerous.  I should not find out that I'm bad at a game by giving myself a repetitive motion injury.

3.  Guitar Battles - This is a new problem for the single player.  Guitar battles in multiplayer might be a good idea.  I don't honestly know.  Seems more interesting than a score-off to me.  Unfortunately, in single player, because of the way the attacks are set up, they're really just an exercise in coin flipping.  Some of the attacks are utterly crippling to the computer player while others, in addition to having a large delay before they become effective, essentially have no impact whatsoever.  If you get the good attacks while you're trying to play, you'll win.  If you don't, you lose.  Whether you're any good or not is really not of much relevance.  That's bad.  Guitar battles in single player, for me, tended toward exercises in frustration at the computer not giving me the tools I needed to succeed and not having any other recourse to win.  They need retooling.

4.  Cooperative Campaign - This is a wonderful idea.  It really is.  But what half-brain decided that there should be exclusive tracks squirreled away in it that I cannot get to?  That's right - I am totally unable to unlock those tracks, because I cannot play the cooperative campaign online.  I'll confess - I'm old.  My friends are married and have families.  The only time I'm going to have somebody with another guitar at my house is if I throw a party, and I'm not really a party kind of guy.  That's not a good reason to keep me from playing frigging Sabotage if I want to.  I will grant that they have made the songs themselves available in online coop play, but nothing I do online seems to unlock anything for me to practice (and I SERIOUSLY need to practice Helicopter before I try THAT again).  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I'm going to assume I know what I'm doing.

5.  Song List - Guitar Hero 2 was pretty good in this regard.  It had a good sampling from a broad spectrum of rock (maybe a little light on new stuff).  Guitar Hero 3 seems to be making a point of digging in the dustbins of rock history.  It's not that the songs are bad, but many of them are outside of my experience, and that puts me off.  I'm a child of the 90s.  This game seems to be a schizophrenic effort to appeal to younger people than me and to older people than me.  Some of the songs also puzzle me.  Kool Thing?  Really, guys?  I can't even tell what I'm supposed to be doing there.  It's barely a song.  There's better Sonic Youth.  There's a distressing number of songs where the lead guitar is nearly invisible, and that makes it kind of hard to play.  The number of master tracks is also disappointingly small, compared to its soon-to-be-released competitor, Rock Band.

Don't get me wrong - the game is fun for what it is, but there's just so much here that could have been done better.  Should have, really.  I hope Neversoft takes some time on the next installment, puts in a fifth difficulty level (between Normal and Hard), and works out the kinks in their new stuff.",negative
2392,"This game has beautiful graphics and is quite fun for a single player, or for a single player with a backup companion (that's really only a helper, not a full player).  It's a shame it's not a multi-player game ala the new Super Mario Brothers game.  I have three kids and all would like to play.",negative
2393,"This was a gift from my girlfriend since she knows how much I love red and black things.  I simply love the look of this controller, but that's about where the ""fun"" stops.  At least for mine, the left analog stick and right trigger don't feel nearly as smooth as my original white controller.  And it's not because the white one was worn in, as I'd only had the Xbox about a week before I got this controller.

On top of this, the lithium battery pack is a complete joke.  If left unattended for about a week, it'll be completely dead.  If left plugged into the Xbox to charge, it'll be dead.  The only way I was able to charge it was to ""play-n-charge"" or leave it connected to my PC.  Though now it won't charge at all...

3 stars or 2...  Can't decide, but it's pretty low on my ""must have"" list...",neutral
2394,"To tell you where I'm coming from, I'll should just say this - GTA 3 is the greatest console game ever - when I first got on a Friday afternoon, I didn't do anything until I completed it Sunday night.  I even liked GTA Vice City, and I completed in a more casual manner, in a matter of a few weeks.  Needless to say that I was looking forward to this game.  I even finished about two thirds of the before I had to abandon it as unplayable and frustrating.

First, the pros.  This has got to be the most impressive game engine ever.  The immensity of this game is huge.  It's more like three games combined into one.  There are three distinct cities (an LA, San Francisco, and a Las Vegas clone).  By far the most expansive game to hit the consoles, ever.  It's at least twice as big as Liberty City in GTA 3, but without any of the loading time when traversing the terrain.  All the cities capture the unique feel of the city in terms of atmosphere and geography.  Just amazing.  In fact, that warm glowing feeling I got when I first played the original GTA 3 returned when I played the San Francisco cloned city.

The number of missions is impressive as well.  It takes about 90 missions to complete the whole storyline.  It's a great value.

Also worth nothing is the radio.  It's got all the rap and rock associated with GTA type destruction from the early nineties.  Some include, N.W.A, Easy E, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, Guns N' Roses, Rage Against the Machine, along with some older music, CCR, Skynard, and some R & B like Boys 2 Men and En Vouge.  A huge lineup full of famous songs.

There are other improvements as well.  The motorbikes are more controllable, and the AI of your friends is designed so they don't jump into gunfire or do something else that is incredibly stupid like they did in Vice City.

So what's wrong?  It all sounds great, right?  Nope.  Rockstar paid scant attention to gameplay.  Sure, when you have over 100 missions total, not everyone can be a winner, but when you're struggling because one out of every 10 missions are long, tedious, or annoying, it just generates a huge headache.  A good rule of thumb would be is that 10% of the missions will take about 60% of your time.

First off, many missions are multi-part, where if you fail in one part, you got to do the beginning all over again.  Now this would be cool if the missions didn't consist of long drives or other such banalities or if this was 1985 and it was the NES, but it's not, and it's unacceptable.  They tried to fix this with an option to skip a drive, but it only works in rare instances, and it requires you to drive back after you failed a mission, meaning that you're still driving the same distance.  In other words, out of the 61 missions I passed, I was able to use it once.

Secondly, there are gimmicks instead of gameplay.  What I mean is that they decided to throw everything at you, despite the fact that most of it is unwanted, unneeded, and unintuitive.  Now you can swim, cycle, workout, get a girlfriend (no joke), use a camera, etc.  Okay, some of these are optional, but many of them are forced upon you in order to advance, and those are annoying and are part of the majority of missions I struggled with.  I was waiting for other useless missions like selling girl scout cookies or more idiotic things like that.

For example, there is a mission that requires twenty minutes of driving before you can use a camera.  The mission and camera are not very well programmed, and the drive is way too long, so it took me about two hours to complete one of the simplest missions of all.  I was fuming after this.

Now the worst thing are the flying levels.  I really have no idea what they were thinking here.  The planes are insanely sensitive and uncontrollable.  I invested over 30 hours into the game, got two-thirds the way through the game, only to hit the 62nd mission.  Now all I had to was pass a few flying lessons.  For two hours, I tried to circle an airfield and land - that's' it, and that's only one of the lessons I had to do.  I just couldn't do it, and this was one of the first lessons too, which meant that the other ones are probably harder.  I just gave up.  My time, like yours, is just too valuable battling bad gameplay.  This is really frustrating because I have never abandoned a game when I was so far into it.  I completed the other GTAs with no cheats or guides, and I've been playing games for 18 years, so it's not like I'm a newbie.

No matter how good a game's engine, graphics, voice acting, or music is, gameplay is still king, and Rockstar failed miserably.  Sure this will sell 5 million or so copies, but Rockstar pretty much is slowing killing a great franchise.

Pros:

Huge game with tons of missions

San Fierro (San Francisco clone) felt just right

Great graphics

Best gaming engine ever made

Improved AI, controls for bike

Unbelievable musical selection

Cons:

Flying is beyond terrible - I cannot stress this enough

Repeat the same things in multiple part missions over and over again.

Too many unintuitive gimmicks.

Cannot skip most missions, so if you're stuck, you're stuck

Useless driving.

Hours to complete (if you can) - 50 hours

Difficulty level: Medium/High

Frustration level: Very high",negative

2396,"...because you can use a mouse and keyboard and run the game at a maximum res. mode of 1920x1200.  It looks like a relatively straightforward conversion to Windows.  Unfortunately, it wasn't all ""smooth sailing.""

Ironically enough, it seems *too much* like the Xbox version.  If I wanted to see the green ""A"" and red ""B"" button interface, I'd be playing the Xbox version.  Looks like someone didn't learn from Gearbox's conversion of the 1st Halo, which they successfully made to look and operate like a PC game.  The higher the res. mode you chose, the more obvious the limitations (and indications) are of this conversion from the Xbox.  I had to set the mouse sensitivity to 6 (out of 10) and I could still see it wasn't fine tuned.  Setting it higher didn't make it better.  I could setup a ""local"" LIVE profile, but it didn't make Windows Live any easier to deal with; it was a pay service at the time, so I declined to make a ""fully functional"" Live profile.

But what has to be the MOST annoying part is the Vista requirement.  Whoever was involved with the PC conversion seemed to be lacking a connection to reality.  Putting aside the hacks that came out to make the game work on Windows XP, there are other things to consider.  The Xbox uses (a modified version of) Windows 2000 as its OS, so how does ANY game that is converted to the PC require Vista?!  You'd think there would be a major improvement, such as using 3-Way SLI, to justify ""Vista required"" but I'd have to say I literally don't see or hear anything in Halo 2 that says you must have Vista.  That's where they put so much of their time and effort?  Along with that absurd hoop jumper Windows Live, I have to wonder how Microsoft could justify the initial pricing while competing with technologically (if not all around) superior games such as Half-Life 2 and Crysis.  If anyone really believed this ""exclusivity"" would increase Vista sales, I'd say they needed a serious reality check.

I'm just glad I was able to get Halo 2 as a freebie with my (then) new computer.  But would I have bought the game by itself at whatever the price was?  Nope.",positive
2397,"Coming on the heels of their near perfect Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Crystal Dynamics wanted to strike in a new direction with a Tomb Raider that would establish their own style for the series. They accomplished that goal, with a very unique story and visuals that blow away not only all previous Tomb Raiders but most other games released in 2008. They also, sadly, managed to trip into some of the old pitfalls that so badly injured the CORE-developed series.

Underworld sees Lara searching for the final conclusion of her mother's tragic story. What began in Legend, and briefly tied into Anniversary, now concludes with Underworld's journey into the ancient Norse mythology of Helheim. It's a nifty premise that sends her to some really remarkable locations like the Mediterranean Sea, a Thailand temple complex, and the Arctic circle. There are quite a few truly shocking twists along the way too, like the destruction of the Croft mansion and the return of the eery Lara doppelganger. And everything looks just stunning, thanks to all the next-generation effects that finally come together well. Dynamic lighting, bloom, and precisely executed anti-aliasing and distance blur blend in perfectly to make this a knockout of a game. Color selection and textures are spot-on in every frame; Lara's yacht on the Mediterranean is blindingly bright and clean, temple interiors are perfectly rotted and filthy, and the new underwater scenery shimmers and glows eaxclty as imagined. It's commendable that all the environmental effects and Lara's beautifully rendered, umm, ""character,"" don't really consume any more computing power than Anniversary. So, bravo in the looks department.

A few new moves have been tossed in to Lara's skillset for Underworld. She now brushes away heavy vegetation, accumulates grime when bumping into dirty walls, can walk along any balance beam-like structure, and can rock climb in multiple directions. While these actions are well-animated, they're not particularly fun or challenging. The only real joy to be had is in examining the environment for the right cues, and seeing the smooth hi-poly animations. The simplified underwater swimming mechanic is nearly perfect, behaving accurately with the two analog sticks and few button presses. (Lara is given breathing apparatus in Underworld, making the huge new oceanic areas much more fun to explore). The silly context-sensitive cutscene actions from Legend and Anniversary have been replaced by unprompted slow-motion scenes, requiring quick action or death. It's a very minor change that makes these infrequent interludes a bit more fun. It's a shame not all of the newness of Underworld is for the better.

Crystal Dynamics is at a dangerous crossroads with the Tomb Raider franchise. They can refine and perfect the strengths of the Tomb Raider concept, as they did with Anniversary, or they can stumble down the path that CORE took. Which was, piling clumsy new moves onto a troubled 3-d engine, refusing to fix the camera issues, and just being generally sloppy programmers. Underworld exhibits all of those ugly traits. For some reason, Lara now moves very haltingly, almost robotically. She comes to a stop immediately as the controller is released, and changes direction on a dime. In theory this sounds good, but in practice it feels very weird and unsettling. Worse, it causes wicked spasms in the camera positioning, which is as un-intelligent as Legend's and Anniversary's. Her character movements are far too over-assisted, with lots of AI help with jumps and just basic walking (you're not even given the choice of manual ledge-grabbing, and invisible barriers prevent you from falling off ledges). This, along with the generously spaced autosaves and hilariously awful human enemies, makes the game feel dull and unchallenging. There are plenty of other complaints, like the lazy repetition of a ship stage filled with 100% identical enemies, all the ugly clipping bugs, and an ending as unsatisfying as Legend's, but really there's just one more big letdown worth noting. The icing on previous Tomb Raider cakes, the wonderful secret item hunt, is a tacked-on afterthought in Underworld. Rather than encouraging exploration of ingenious bonus areas, the vast majority of the new (identical, numerous, and boring) bonus items are stored in plain view. Scattered on floors, or ""hidden"" in obvious clay pots (now breakable by kicking, yippee), the jewel collecting is pointless and uninspired. It seems like a passive-aggressive kick in the jewels to Tomb Raider fans who enjoy the franchise's traditional treasure hunting.

Hopefully, Underworld is just a misstep by the Crystal Dynamics team and not an indication that they're already losing interest in Ms. Croft's adventures. As an ardent Tomb Raider gamer myself, I'd love to see them continue with the solid formulas developed in their previous two attempts.",negative
2398,"I got this mouse as part of the Logitech sale a month ago, and everything was great, it looks fantastic, the click wheel was perfect, the primary buttons were great, but as an optical mouse it just doesn't work very well without a decent mouse pad. Don't get me wrong, it tracks well on most surfaces, just not as smoothly or accurately as a laser mouse. Also the side buttons were a little too small and difficult to press. It's a great mouse for the price, but I would suggest paying a bit extra and getting the Logitech 700 series instead.",negative

2400,"At first I put in shift with every intention of not likely it, but several hours later I found myself firing the game back with different intention... to have an adrenaline fueled excitement race behind the wheel! Many months ago, I was just another nay saver, posting negative comments about the series shifting in the wrong direction. It's definitely fair now to retract my previous statement, as I always seem to do with this series (Refer to my review on Pro Street). They did a wonderful job transforming an arcade series into a full pledged simulated racer.

I've played every single racer that has been released on the next-gen consoles, and I can't even count how many dating back to last generation. In my honest opinion, Need for Speed Shift's new cockpit view is hands-down the most exhilarating and realistic experience that you would have behind the wheels of a car. From the shaking of the car, the heavy breathing of you as the driver, and best of all the disorientation that is experienced when slamming into a wall over 100 mph.  The graphics are also the best in the series, with a great polish over vivid colors, plush textures and practically no frame rate issues. I gave shift 4 stars for entertainment value because it simply is very entertaining. However I gave it 3 stars in over all because of some minor set backs that don't entirely bring the games value down, but don't help very much in the over all dept.

My grips with the game come in random fashions: 1. Instant relay is somewhat lack-luster, with poor camera movement and excitement, though kind in mind the series has really never had replays, except for Underground 2. 2. Customizations have dumb down too much, this coming from a series that invented the ""auto-sculpt"" in Carbon. 3. Lack of visualization in the menus, before the series offered a ""photo mode"", to get an overview of the car, but that has been taken away by far.

So all in all, this is a solid title with plenty of replay value for the time being. Now sure how shift will hold up once Forza 3 and GT 5 are released, but it definitely fills the void for the time being. This game falls somewhere in-between the hardcore simulation and the casual arcade racers. If you are open-minded and prefer to play both types of racers, the Shift is worth your time. However, if you a junkie for tuning cars and customization of engine parts, then this game may not be for you... just remember to have fun with this game, that's what it was created for!",positive

2406,"As an avid fan of first two CCs, I initially warmed to ""Battle of the  Bulge"". What better subject matter? The great battle pitting Germany's  feared Tiger tank against the flimsy US Shermans, first immortalised in the  Hollywood movie of the same name, and now brought to life by the best  wargame producers around.
  True to the faith, CC4 has wonderful sound  effects and battlefield concepts -- for instance, unexploded shells in  burning tanks periodically blow up, keeping you on the edge of your seat,  particularly if they go up while your men are creeping around nearby.
  The addition of rocket half-tracks, though perhaps not entirely  historically accurate, adds a great wildcard. No matter how strong your  force, the odds can be changed in an instant by a few well-placed missiles  from the enemy. Also great is the ability to bombard the enemy or call in a  Mustang to drop something down the chimney of the Panzer leader.
  The  switch to a strategic map of the entire battlefield is also great fun. Now  you can feel that you're driving the whole campaign, not just directing a  few ants at a time. The option to choose time limits on individual battles  is also good as is the addition of a ""sneak"" movement for  individual squads.
  But after a few plays, I found my enjoyment  fading into frustration.
  Campaigns run for far too long. Unless, you  are hospitalised and have nothing else to do all day, getting through a  grand campaign will take weeks and cost you most of the significant  relationships in your life.
  Monotony. The length of the campaigns  might not be so bad except that each mission somehow starts to seem very  similar to the last after a few battles. It may be the ubiquitous snowy  terrain and the lack of variation in the weapons.
  Line of fire. This  is sometimes difficult to distinguish -- you'll be sitting in what you  think is a gully when next thing you know you're actually in clear sight of  a Panzer. This is an unrealistic and occasionally annoying factor as line  of fire certainly would have been clear to those on the ground.
  No  Battlemaker!! While you can create your own strategic map operations, you  don't have the wonderful battlemaker of CC2. You have to try to find the  battlegroups that are carrying your favourite weapons and then position  them on the map. It takes time, trial and error, and doesn't always work.
  You are are supreme ... too supreme. The computer is generally too  weak an opponent whether on the defence or the attack. While that is better  than it being too strong, it does become boring.
  Bugs!! On the two  computers I played, the game was fatally flawed with bugs. ""Internal  errors"" would occasionally appear in the middle of the most gripping  games, or the most important junctures in campaigns.
  And, last but  not least;  No Tigers!! The movie version of the battle was famous for  the Tiger tank. The CC4 manual also refers to these monsters. However, they  never appear, except as tank destroyers. That is a major disappointment.",neutral

2409,"Well, being a fan of the IL series and Allied 4.0 as real hardcore sims this is more 'arcadish' than anything else. You start out as a Navy pilot in the Pacific and are tasked with various missions utilizing different aircraft, from a P-40 Warhawk at Pearl Harbor and graduate to using Cosairs, P-38 Lightenings and torpedo bombers. Naturally depending upon the difficulty level you choose for each mission you'll be awarded with the use of Japanese aircraft as well to use in any of the missions you wish to re-play. Which is rather strange because if you decide to use a Japanese plane during the first Pearl Harbor mission, you find yourself up against the same scripted program shooting down other Japanese aircraft. At least with IL Sturmovik or Pacific Fighters if you decide to hop into an Axis plane you find yourself against Allied planes. That is making sure you've set your paramenters up to do so.

This is little more than an aracde style shoot-'em-up and if you're looking to just shoot down planes and rack up points with aircraft that requires nothing more than the sole use of a joystick then its something you can't do without.
If you're loking for soemthing more to sink your teeth into as far as realisim, missions and controls that you can set from simple to realistic, stick with the Oleg Madov IL/Pacific Fighter series.",negative
2410,"UPDATE -

Added another star - per by buck-an-hour rule for games, this game has earned it.  Currently my cost/hour to play this game is about $0.47/hr (compared to that pos MW3's $30/hr).

nVidia 3dVision support fixed. Seems optimized for near-field effects more so than distance, even when tweaking depth settings.

IRNV (Infra Red Night Vision) scope nerfed.  Seems like it no longer shows enemies unless they are close enough to pistol whip ya - even in cold, dark tunnels.  Yer better off just blindly hitting 'Q' to spot the enemy and aim for their taco chips.

Server Disconnects - fewer, and less often but annoying nonetheless to get dropped after 20 minutes of decent gameplay.

keybinding is stable.

Saitek x52 - fail (still)

cheating and stat padding - rampant, but seems to be slightly less so.  Maybe because there really aren't a lot of unique unlocks.  Sure there are lots of guns, and each seems to have an unlock, but it's the same unlocks different guns.  Yawn.

---------------------------

I was in the beta, purchased via Origin on pre-order, and have been disappointed in the purchase from the very first day. Seriously, the beta was betta!  Yeah, the graphics are nice, especially ULTRA on a factory OC ASUS GTX560,  when you can actually experience them that is.  Hours have been wasted looking for a game, connecting, server timeout.  Try again, ooh I got in and played for all of 15 minutes... disconnected from EA login server, and again...  this time it's Origin server problems...  and again <sigh> ... punkbuster failure... BF3 reinstall... wow this IS a helluva good time, eh?

While the web-browser server-launcher interface thingy has a sort of nice feature (the comm center - since in-game voip is so damned hard to get right), too bad it's not squad/team/global like ETQW, or at least team/global, for the most part it is a cumbersome joke. Imagine having to close and re-launch battlefield each and every time you change servers - how cool is that?  Sure, it makes patching the server browser code easier as you aren't patching the whole game client, but when you have to do as many re-installs as I (and apparently others here) have to even get this crap to run for a few minutes, it's a complete and utter fail.

Oh, think your nVidia 3D Vision setup is just the ticket for some serious pwnage?  think again!  NOT SUPPORTED!  Yeah, regardless of the hype and literature, nVidia 3D Vision which is works beautifully with other games (MoH, TF2, TDU2, BFBC2, and many of others as well as 3D bluray movies) is NOT SUPPORTED?!?!?!!

Joysticks for the jets and helos?  NOT! My Saitek x52 is not supported along, with most other joysticks it seems if the forums are to be believed.

Keybinds fail more often than not (odd though, they worked fine in the beta).

Oh, did I mention the insane amount of cheaters?  Private servers where teams take turns capping the objectives and killing/avenging for ribbons/medals/unlocks. Yup, $60 and you too can be pwned by the finest lamers in the land.

Take it from me, you're better off spending the $60 on your rig, or paying off some of your debt. If you absolutely MUST have this game, you're clearly a masochist...  do NOT buy this game, but if you really gotta, at least wait until after xmas for the price to drop to a reasonable range.  Heck, you should be able to get both BF3 *and* MW3 in January for the same $60, and BF3 might actually get patched into being a playable game by then - just sayin'",positive
2411,"The game itself is fun. However, the description says this is co-op. This game is NOT co-op on the campaign. You can do firefight together but that's it. Had I known this, I probably wouldn't have purchased it.",neutral
2412,"Very dated, but offers a great open world to explore. A short car list, limited customization, and a difficult police system keep it from getting four stars.",negative
2413,"I'd heard that Stalker was one of the most atmospheric games out there, and having loved the Tarkovsky film of the same name, I was ready to love this game. But even though I kept pushing myself to return to it in the hope that it'd suck me in, it just kept leaving me cold. In the end, after 20+ hours, I gave up.

The graphics are decent, though a few things regularly break the atmosphere. The dialogue with most NPCs feels wooden, and this is made worse by inconsistent modes of communication: sometimes people speak English, sometimes Ukrainian, and sometimes they stay silent but 'speak' via text boxes. It's hard to feel like you're in a believable place when your conversations feel like they were hastily slapped together after the game outgrew its voiceover budget.

Wrestling with the convoluted interface isn't fun either. I like the ""PC games should be intelligent and detailed"" philosophy, but this interface just seems poorly designed, not to mention ugly. Merely checking your map as you travel is a hassle, and the inventory system gets clunky real fast, since you spend so much time juggling your items to fit under the weight quota.

The combat is pretty good (and murderously difficult on the hardest setting, which is great if you like a real challenge). The AI is smart and unpredictable, and some gunfights are nail-bitingly intense, where even the most careful strategy and skilled shooting barely scrapes you through. Movement feels unnatural, though. For example, crouching doesn't smoothly lower the view, but just instantaneously pops it to the lower position. Things like this make you feel less like a person moving around a real landscape, and more like a camera moving around a 3D engine.

Overall, it's a game worth considering, and if it floats your boat, then great. But for a game that demands so much of your time and effort, I found it too unpolished and clunky. I never really connected with the story or the characters, and instead of a deep, affecting atmosphere, I just found it drab.",neutral

2416,"I really enjoyed the game up until the end. It's a fantastic world, the character interactions are great, there are multiple ways to resolve a lot of the quests, and it was very enjoyable to play. You can create a character any way you want and play him/her however you want. You can side with different factions, which gives completely different ways to go through the game. It was a lot of fun and I played if for over 20 hours. Then I got to the end and the final battle was impossible so I couldn't finish it. Very disappointing.",positive
2417,"The core gameplay doesn't change much and there's nothing wrong with it. They've added some new moves and mini-games. That's a nice touch. Multi-player froze my console once, so I didn't get my hands on it much.

The controls can be clunky and annoying, especially the target locking. You'll mess up quite a lot of your quick or stealth kills because of it. You might feel like you're getting old and clumsy along with Ezio. For me, that strangely adds the feeling to the game, though it gets me upset sometimes.

However, one SERIOUS flaw that bashes this game down to 3 stars is that there's a loop hole which makes you stuck and can't progress pass the Memory Sequence 3 - Guild Contracts mission in a single player mode.

In this Memory Sequence, the game will force you to send one assassin on a mission as a part of a tutorial. If you play only the main story missions up to this point, there's no problem. You'll have a Level-11 assassin to send on a contract mission (the pigeon coup thing, as in AC: Brotherhood) as required.

BUT, as I had spent 12+ hours before this mission to open the map, set up shops, fight for territories, and order my assassins around, that made the level of my assassins go up to Level 12. The Guild Contracts mission didn't acknowledge my assassins since they were one level too high. (Yeah, sorry, your men are too strong. They'll fail the mission.) And once you interact with a Pigeon Coup, the game doesn't let you back out until you finish this tutorial.

That means, if you don't have an EXACT Level-11 assassin, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop, AKA Limbo.

I tried look up a solution on the internet. Sadly, none of them worked for me.
Quitting to-and-fro Animus Island didn't do anything.
I couldn't recruit any new low-level assassin since I had captured all the Templar Dens and did the Den Defense mini-games to a high level already.
I had waited for the Templar to re-capture the Dens, but no luck either.
* EDIT * The assassin recruiting chance never occurred again.

Finally, after hours of trials and errors, I had to give up, throw away my 12-hour work, and start over a new game.

Dear Ubisoft,
WHAT KIND OF AN OPEN-WORLD GAME DOESN'T LET YOU DO THINGS AT YOUR OWN PACE !?!?!?

I like to do side quests first, until my characters are quite loaded, then I do story missions. Is that too much to ask from a sand-box game? NO !!!
And I know it's not any harder to make the game check for A RANGE of levels instead of an EXACT specific level.

I normally get very (un)lucky with discovering bugs, glitches, and loop holes so often in games. I jumped through collisions (invisible walls) many times in the past Assassin's Creeds. Didn't bother me one bit. I know that a high degree of freedom comes with bugs and glitches.

But this one game punishes you with Limbo for getting too far ahead before the game let you. What the hell !?!?

Dear Ubisoft,
This is the nastiest mistake since your infamous online-authenticity-checking system. PLEASE FIRE THE PROGRAMMER(s) RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

In conclusion:
Revelations offers some new good stuff (I like Den Defense a lot, actually). But with a serious flaw like this, it deserves only 3 stars.

I know that if you're already an AC fan, you'll buy it anyway. So be warned and hope you have a better luck with it than me.",negative

2420,First off I have to say that I have owned every version of NHL from EA Sports ever made dating all the way back to NHL for Genesis in 1990.  And what gets me is that this is the WORST version of the game they have ever released.  I wasn't a huge fan of 2001 but it was at least solid and I know I owned it on the PC so the graphics were better but still the PS2 graphics are somewhat weak.  THe controls are fidgity and the comentary oh my lord who thought that would be funny.  The Franchise mode is still pathetic...(Lets see some impressive offseason simulation.). The game has become either a fast paced mash of buttons or just floating in unleashing slap shots at the goal.  Strategy is comming along but still the game is all arcade...,positive
2421,"I was rather disappointed with this chapter in the Call of Duty franchise. Treyarch has shown that they were not prepared to pick up the torch left behind by Infinity Ward - they simply ""couldn't see the forest for the trees,"" so to speak; I applaud the level of detail achieved in the individual characters, achieved via facial mapping, motion tracking, etc., yet they completely neglected more worldly details that detract from the overall experience. Firstly, the general movements of the characters are choppy and sluggish, rather than organic and smooth - character's physical reactions to things such as slippey wurfaces, or bullet hits are repetitive and mechanical. The absence of ""the little details,"" as well as repetitive use of models in level environments make for a bland and unrealistic experience. The audio is atrocious; the sounds of gunfire , explosions, etc. are pathetically weak. Furthermore, it seems to be a rather unstable, inefficient engine - unless you are playing on XBox or Playstation, which are platform-optimized and lacking in quality, you'll need a fairly high-end, new system to run it on to experience it in ""all of its glory.""

But my biggest grievance is the absence of gritty, epic moments found in MW2, which I consider to be the pinnacle of the franchise. Instead, it seems to have regressed to an storyline experience on par with the earliest series' in the franchise.

Like them or not, Infinity Ward was innovative - Treyarch simply lifted and copied bits and pieces of what Infinity Ward mastered.

Nevertheless, dedicated fans of the franchise will still find the game to be generally enjoyable",negative

2428,"Titanfall is OK, and can be fun, but based on the hype I was truly hoping for a chance to reinvent my personal online experience. And this is because I truly suck compared to most FPS gamers. I am at best an average player that enjoys FPS's but the complete and utter suffering I have endured online during years of MW and COD have resulted in a series of premature abandonments of 60 dollar titles. Finally, for as much slack as it has received,  Ghost's Squads totally saved my butt in online participation as I do OK and don't get slaughtered the minute I enter the field. With all the noise over Titanfall, I had hoped for a fresh chance to compete with all the other kids with its claims of original gameplay, so that I might have another opportunity to be OK online. But without the ability to practice in any way, no single player to try different styles, I still get butchered by the run-and-gunners. Sadly, Ghosts Squads (and the Ripper) still is a better online experience for the average (or below) player.
I will keep trying - I am better at parkouring, better at going up than across, but at the end of the day, competitive play is still the domain of the person who is twitchier than I.

I would like to add that I purchased this from Microsoft because they had a preorder 10 dollar store credit. Please, please never buy from them. I certainly won't again. I never received the credit, and trying to get this from MS has been absolutely painful. Long waits, getting passed around from the store to XBoxLive and back again without any resolution. Just astoundingly awful customer service, remarkably so.

BTW, and this has nothing to do with Amazon or the game other than I will never not buy a video game from Amazon again...finally got someone at the MS store to understand my problem, and she gave me a code after about 45 minutes of her talking to her supervisor. My guess is that she was just having a smoke break, cuz the code was just bogus. Seriously. Will never, ever, purchase from Microsoft again.",positive

2431,"Longtime racing game need for speed came up with a new title exclusively on psp last year. The game isn't that much of great but still its the first game i got for my psp and i liked it. I think it could have been way better i don't know what they were trying to prove with this game but it isn't the need for speed i once played.

But it also has its goods as the graphics are very nice and there is many cars. The enviroments aren't great i don't like the desings for racetracks they just lost the edge they had. You can upgrade many parts of your car and choose many things. The cars are looking really good once you change them and you have paint,vinyls and more to customize your car.

You should be allowed to leave. Secondly, it sucks the game does not continue with the team you played previously, thus necessitating you to re-start matchmaking. Thirdly, there are few game-types for the amount of Halo's available. A Big Team Battle should be available for each halo, for example, as each game has it's perks. All in all, the fun thins out very fast from having to re-start matchmaking over and over again, with a limited amount of maps and games for each individual Halo. In the end, it was well worth it, as playing  the original Halo online was priceless. I am nervous about Halo 5, as the expectations of Halo MCC were high and the delivery was borderline.",positive

2439,"I finished this game about a week ago.  I haven't played through too many games on the psp as yet, so I don't have too much of a basis for comparison.

That said, this game was a good way to spend 40+ hours for my money.  I enjoyed the scenery, the combat system doesn't take you long to get ahold of, and the slow addition of characters lets you work up to managing all four of their attacks and special abilities at once.

The storyline seemed a little contrived, not surpising for a handheld rpg.  The ""blade dancer"" himself arrives on the island to ""test his skills"".  Right.  The arguments he has with various villains throughout the game are sometimes childish and cliched all to hell, but very occasionally some dry humor comes through.  It's very welcome when it's there.

My biggest (and for the most part only) complaint is how much running back and forth you must do in this game, often painstakingly trying to figure out what mysterious hoop you have to jump through to move on.

At one point it was extremely clear where I had to go to advance the story, but the creature I was to slay didn't show up.  After about four hours (that's a conservative estimate) of trial and error I figured out that a seemingly unrelated side quest had to be done before the monster would appear.  The appearance of helpful portals to jet you around the various areas happens way too late in the game, in my opinion.  By that time you either have only a tenuous grip on your sanity or you put the game down for good.

If you own a psp already, I'd say this game is worth buying if it's cheap or used.",positive

2441,"Need for Speed Underground is a pretty good racing game. Its not bad. I would reccomend renting it first before buying it. There are better racing games out, such as Project Gotham Racing 2, but this is not a real bad choice if you are looking for a street racing game. There are many different types of racing in this game though, like drag racing too. The ""go underground"" mode is the main mode and the best mode in this game. You can completely trick out your car to make it the most stylish and famous ride on the road. Plus, you can make magazine covers and gan respect and street cred. The graphics are pretty good, and there is a good framerate and sense of speed. There is a style points system, a little similar to the kudos system seen in Project Gotham Racing 1 & 2, but truthfully, its not as well done.  It just seems tacked on. I don't like every song on the soundtrack either and some annoy me, but there are some decent songs, such as the ones by Rancid and Rob Zombie(two awesome bands). So, if this game is so good why only a 3 out of 5? Well, it just doesen't seem extremely fun and its not the most original game ever, and it is annoying sometimes. But, its still decent and at least worth renting. When will the never ending quest of gaining street cred ever end? Not any time soon, apparently.",positive
2442,"I was interested when I first saw Incredible crisis. It looked so funny I was imediatly hooked. After playing it on a demo disk I was ready to laugh and fall down while playing. Was I satisfied? Well...kinda. Incredible Crisis is a fun but flawed game that needs some serious tinkering before they come out with(I won't spoil it for those of you who have reached the ending). Let me say the good points first. First off this is the funniest game I have ever played, I fell down laughing many times, laughing untill my lungs hurt. The FMV sequences are well done and often the funniest parts of the game. The music is the best part of the game. It is incredibly addictive and you will find yourself humming the music hours after you stopped playing. Well thats all the good parts. Now for the bad parts. Incredible Crisis has 4 serious flaws that seriously inhabited my enjoyment of the game. The first flaw is that there is little replay value, except if you want to see all the FMVs a! gain (Which you cant watch once you finish the game, unlike the mini-games). The second isint that serious but whenever you want to load a game it seems that the game dosent want you to because it always places the cursur on the ""Cancel"" button. The third flaw is that your fingers will be mush after you finish this game(On the positive side, your fingers will be really strong). And finally the biggest flaw of all. This is way too hard. Some of these games are just insane in terms of difficulty. The elevator of doom, the back rubbing game, and (Shudder) the pound for pound and the Golden pig games. These can be so frusturating you will scream and rip your hair out. I'm talking Throw-your-controller-smash-the-TV-obliterate-the-game-disk frusterating. Still this is a OK game that is more worthy of a rental then a purchase.

2444,"I originally purhcased the game for PS3 because i was buying every 3rd party title for 360 because they looked better and wanted to see how this one faired up. Well i was impressed UNTIL i downloaded the demo on xbox to compare to the game on PS3. Well to my dismay this version looked very uncolorful, washed out, was extremely laggy with terrible frame rate drops during large zombie attacks and certain areas with heavy water and foilage. The game itself is great, although being a team can be a big tedious sometimes it adds a great new twist to the adventure. I took the PS3 version back got store credit which was still a lot and got it for xbox, played all the way through and defeated it no sweat, well a little sweat in some areas ha. The game is not what i would call HARD, but can be a lil difficult in some areas. The PC version looks totally incredible(hense why that version was up for best graphics) and the 360 wasn't far behind. So overall this game is great, just don't get ""this"" version its plagued with many bugs, not that its unplayable or anything but just not as impressive as the other two. Why am i writing this a year after the games release, not sure, it popped in my head so i just woke up and wrote it lol. Go figure. Get it for what system you want no matter what I say, not swaying anyone, just what my experience was.

2446,"I got this for Christmas and put away my beloved Pokemon Diamond so I could start playing this.  I worked my way up to three puppies and had a lot of fun for about 2 weeks.  However, it's getting really old now.  I mean, all there is to do is walk the dogs, enter the same old competitions (which takes about 2 minutes per competition), feed, water & wash the dogs.  I can't spend all day playing it.  So, I've gotten to the point where I'm bored with it.  I placed 2 of my 3 dogs in the Dog Hotel so I don't have to worry about feeding & walking them.  I would happily put the third dog there just so I wouldn't have to power up the game every day and do these (by now) tedious tasks.  But it won't let me put all three of my puppies in the hotel.  This means I either have to keep playing this game for a while every day - and it's not insignificant; takes about half an hour just to walk my dog now, not counting park time & practice for competitions - or leave the game turned off and risk my puppy running away...which is racking me with guilt.  I really think Nintendo could have done better to make the game time pass only when the DS is on, and have time stop when it's actually powered off.

Plus...I really wanted to unlock the Beagle, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and Husky...and so far though I'm up to 13000 trainer points, none of those breeds have been unlocked.  It takes a long time to earn trainer points, too.  With three dogs at the house, walking each of them three times a day, feeding, bathing, entering competitions, playing and practicing for competitions, I still only earn about 1000 trainer points per day, which means every time I unlock a breed that isn't what I want, I know there are 2 more days of the same old routine, until I get another chance to see if those breeds will unlock.

Yes, I could wipe the cartridge and simply not play it anymore...but then I'd be racked with guilt for ""ending the life"" of my three puppies! Ack!

2449,"Growing up, I played Punch Out and Super Punch Out. Those two games hold a special place in my memories. They were a lot of fun and gave me and my friends hours of enjoyment. The games used the power of the system and were easy to learn but difficult to master.

This Punch Out was made in the mold of Punch Out for the NES. Some of the same characters and similar controls as the NES. The motion controls added a little bit extra to the game, but really didn't add that much for me. The game played way too much like the NES version. All I had to do was figure out the right punching pattern to use and the attack patterns the computer used.

I can't say what it was that I wanted in this game. There was something undefinable which was missing from it. The Mario games evolved as it progressed through the systems. Punch Out, for me, was stagnant. I think it's great this game has gotten so many high reviews. If you loved this game, that's awesome. I wish I was one of them.",neutral
2450,was that just ok,positive
2451,"Admittedly I'm a little late coming on board with Crysis 2... I've read the previous reviews and noticed a lot of mixed opinions on the game, so far that reason I decided to hold off until it hit the bargain bin. Typically when a game starts getting mixed reviews like that, my experience is that the game will end up being a mixed bag of both good features and areas that need improvement.

Actually my experience with this one has been that of being pleasantly surprised. The machine I'm running it on is an AMD FX 8 core processor and Gigabyte GTX 650 Ti Boost, so I was able to take advantage of the DX11 patch and HiRes add-on. That being said, graphics wise the game definitely is a looker... I want to refrain too much from comparing it to the original as this is a completely different environment. Suffice to say that if the player has the ability to run it at maximum settings with the add-ons, I don't think there are many that would honestly claim to be disappointed with the results! :-) Likewise sound and soundtrack are also excellent. Player interface is pretty much standard for the genre, so no great surprises there.

Personally, I think the reason for most of the criticism with this game is that there is a rather large disconnect from the original Crysis. First, there is the storyline. For those who played Crysis 1 (You have played it, haven't you?), Prophet was seen heading back to the island to finish off the job that he started in dealing with the alien threat. Now he shows up in New York as the carrier of an alien virus, handing off his suit to a new protagonist named Alcatraz, and the world seems to be going to hell in a hand-basket around him. What the hell happened in between the two games? Certainly could have been handled better.

The other big disconnect is that this game went from a relatively open-ended game-play style to something much more linear. While I do tend to prefer the former, the fact that this storyline is more focused is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. Think in terms of the Half-Life series, and that is overall what this game feels like. One thing this game does offer however, and this is a carryover from the other Crysis, is that it still allows plenty of latitude on how to approach a given combat. Do you prefer to be stealthy and take out your opponent with a knife? Sniper on the rooftops? Classic run and gun? Any of these styles are possible.

The suit options have been streamlined such that things before that required manual activation like Strength mode, are now automatic. There really is only the choice between stealth and armor now. It does allow for upgrades however as the player is able to harvest alien biomass for integration into the suit.

Gameplay itself is fun though pretty standard at this point. There was some criticism of the game's AI, but I felt that it was overall pretty typical of the genre. In other words, they are capable of mounting a reasonably competent defense when attacked, but will generally go back to milling around like nothing happened when things quiet down. Another criticism is that the environment isn't breakable... mostly true. Glass and small objects can be broken, and other objects like crates can be tossed around. Does get a little silly however when firing say the main gun from a tank at a search light and all it does is spin around.

Now, I do personally have one major criticism of the game, and for me this is a big one. The version of Crysis 2 that I got was the ""EA Classics"" release... meaning it was a reissue. The game had NONE of the patches included. Furthermore, I could tell during the install that once again Electronic Arts had released the initial game without sufficient play-testing and as such when this game was originally released it had a lot of bugs. It actually took me three tries to correctly install the game and get it to patch properly. After two years, this really should have been a non-issue and is inexcusably sloppy on the part of EA. If there is one thing that annoys me to no end is to be a ""pay-in"" beta tester (meaning that the software is released to the public before being fully tested and relies on customer input to resolve problems), and is the primary reason I don't buy initial releases anymore, preferring to wait a few months until they can chase all the bugs out. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect the game to work without major issues (crashing, freezing, failure to patch, etc.) out of the box. EA has become really bad about this in the last few years, and honestly I was about ready to hang it up on them. Fortunately I was able to get everything to work in the end.

If I were to sum up Crysis 2 in a sentence, it would be ""been there, done that"". Definitely a fun game, and when working correctly a solid first-person shooter that is definitely worth a look at especially since it can be got on the cheap these days. Unfortunately there is nothing about it that really stands out from the genre, and for those looking for the type of bleeding edge innovations and technology that put the Crytek team on the map, don't expect much from this package. In short, it's the sort of game for people like me who are looking for a decent first person shooter ""fix"" without spending a lot of money or brainpower to get it!",positive

If your into scifi shooters then hit up Resistance 2 for a superior experience overall.",positive
2455,"One of the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever played. Rarely do I become frustrated with a game. In all the history of me playing console games I have never had a game freeze on me. While it's only frozen once so far in my play through, so many other problems with it make me want to pull my hair out.

For one, the gameplay on the ps3 is terrible. While the VATS system is nice, actual combat is terrible. Using the thumb sticks to aim, you can almost never hit your target the first time, almost guaranteeing that you will get hit. When Rad Scorpions now give you poision damage that gradually suck your health away, it has become an effort in luck, which is not how any game should be. You can't block, or ""melee"" knocking a target back (like in borderlands), so there is no way to stop or prevent a hit. While you can argue that very few shooters give you that option, in an RPG like this, some sort of defense mechanism is needed. I literally wanted to throw my controller through the screen in frustration fighting enemies, and that hasn't happened to me since the playstation 1 days.

Speakingh of combats, weapons aren't very original, you'll run out of bullets for weapons rather quickly, and not all merchants have the same bullet types to buy. Instead of combating being fun, it can be a serious chore to try and aim and bob and weave bullets since you're character is soooo slooow. You'd think they would have adjusted your run speed since you can spend 30 minutes traveling from one place to another, and since your character moves at a crawl, it can get seriously tedious. I just can't stress how frustrating combat can be, and how dissapointing it is.

The graphics for whatever reason are hideous. I played fallout 3 for the pc, and while they weren't a technical achievement they were nice. The desert is bland and textures repeat. It's sparesly populated and when you do have an encounter, enemies run faster than you so you are again, guareteed to take damage instead of relying on skill to play.

Overall this is pretty much Fallout 3.5. I haven't noticed any serious differences between this and Fallout 3, but they are asking a full game price. [...] bucks in store for this is a serious rip off. Especially give the horrendous loading times which seriously damper an exploration based game. Waiting 10 to 20 seconds to enter a room, finding nothing of interest, then leaving causing another 20 second load time is mind numbing. When traveling youll find the game stutters from loading the next area, which isn't a game killer but is distracting.

Music is sparse. It be nice for a few different medoldies while you traverse the wasteland, but you get one tune and while nice, gets old after awhile. You can load the radio, but since it's all music from the 60's, it isn't especially enticing,

I know I've ragged on it a lot, but I literally just threw my controller from the combat frustation, but there are some nice elements here. VATS is fun and there are a lot of weapons. You have lots of choices to make which is what gives fallout it's advantage on other games.

It's really just pathetic they released it in this state, with these difficulty tweaks and basically the same gameplay as fallout 3. They seriopusly need to revamp combat and the graphics for the next one. Defintely wait till this hits [...] bucks or a GOTY edition is released. As it stands now it IS NOT worth the 60 asking price.",neutral

2459,"As I said, not worth fifty dollars. The detail of the backgound is indeed impressive. The sounds are in tune and don't sound like old age game songs. I like this game because of the characters you get to play such as the mythological creatures. I have never seen a game that had these creatures in it. The closest game that came to this was the LOTR series. The background of this game was amazing. Technology this advanced made the game more life like. The castle, forest, and even the battle were life like. The characters on the other hand need a little tune up. There is only one problem with them and only one character, which is susan. She stands funny. Some people don't usually care about that, but it was enough to catch my eye. Congrats to caspian's uncle, he knows how to fight. I didn't like lucy that much. She only used daggers. Daggers don't do much for my taste like swords and bows and arrows do. There was one part in the game where caspian was talking, but his mouth didn't move. Sometimes when the characters spoke, their mouth isn't in sync with the words. There was another thing, aslan didn't show up! Then there was the worst thing, after the battle ended, the game ended. In the snap of fingers, it ended! I give a five on detailed background, four on the characters, and a zero on aslan's appearance. The worst thing out of all this is that the game itself didn't even last two hours. It was too easy!",negative
2460,"This game is a solid 3 stars. The reasoning being besides the obvious comments about the missing toddlers and the pool missing in the beginning, but which they gave back, I miss the free world playing where you can simply visit the neighborhood without a loading screen. I'll give Sims 4 the realistic aspects of the Sims resembling the person playing or however you want it, plus the cool features of unlocking stuff and aspirations/traits. The Sims 4 reminds me of a more advanced version of the Sims 2. Although Sims 3 is much better hands down on certain features that are lacking in Sims 4, I wish not only they added the careers back in which you can actually see your Sim actually going to work, but I wish they kept removing the loading screen just like Sims 3, how it was so easy to view anything.",positive
2461,"Still in the middle of this and it has me scratching my head.
A.I. can be pretty frickin' dumb some times.
-Just recently I hid behind a box and a ""baddy"" walked up to the other side of the box. As he stood there, I jumped out and started swinging my bat with crazy kung fu fury and nothing happened! He remained standing as if I wasn't going Postal on him!!  So I kept swinging violently with furious rage and suddenly he grabbed me, threw me to the ground and punched me in the face until I was dead!!  What the??
-At one point ""Tess"" was standing about 2 feet from a Security Guard, who proceeded to walk past her. Of course I shot him in the head with my shotgun.
-Which brings me to shotguns. Effective shotgun range is generally 20 yards.  But, as with most games these days and the misconception that ""shotguns are only effective at 2 inches because they are scattershot"" you will be shooting a lot of ""2 inches away battles""  Even if you shoot them in the head at 10 yards, they still run after you uninjured.

2465,"I bought this game from FuncoLand - or whatever that used game place that doesn't exist anymore was called - for something around 10 bucks.  My first thought when playing it was, ""Man, these graphics aren't near as good as what I remember from the arcade.""

I understandably attibuted this thought to a poor memory combined with a nostalgic feeling that things in my childhood seemed much better than they actually were.  But when I saw some old arcade screenshots of the original, the graphics looked truly as wonderful as I remembered.  They looked like modern graphics actually.  I was surprised.  The NES just couldn't duplicate arcade graphics like that.  No wonder I thought the NES graphics looked so crummy.  They WERE crummy, even if other versions of Rampage looked even worse.

But the NES rampage is the ONLY version without the Wolf guy.  What a bummer!  That takes away a third of the fun right there.

Still, this game ain't bad to play.  Nice and simple and relaxing.  Great to play late at night.  I played it ALL the way through during the 4th of July, all 128 levels that look exactly the same.  (The towns in Hawaii look like the towns in Illinois for instance, but you have to expect that from old games.)

Its not a game you play to see the ending (since the ending is nothing but credits) but its like a handheld slot machine.  You do the same thing over and over again for hours just to give your mind a break.  You have infinite continues so you can play for as long as you want.  Darn, if only the graphics were like the arcade version though.",neutral
2466,"Simply, if you're a die-hard Halo fan and can't get enough you won't go wrong by picking this title up. But, if you think Halo peaked with Combat Evolved and has declined since then this game will do nothing to change your beliefs.

Single Player:
While the Campaign is better than Halo 3's and ODST (and of course always enjoyable with friends) it provides little new and in some cases even recycles old levels from prior Halo games. The new abilities are fun, and the space battle was a gimmicky distraction, but there's really only a couple of new weapons and exactly zero new enemies to fight. While it's nice to fight intelligent and difficult Elites again, Reach really would've went out with a bang if they included boss battles, scarab fights (a massive highlight in Halo 3) or introduced some new enemy types that haven't been played out to death over the last 4 installments.

As far as story goes, Halo jumped the shark when it was revealed The Little Shop of Horrors controls all the flood and Reach continues that nosedive.

Multiplayer:
In terms of Multiplayer, there are only a few largely uninspired maps available on disc that lack any aesthetic diversity or strategy (e.g. team slayer = grab power weapons and camp). Most of what you'll play are Forge World creations or maps that look and feel similarly to those (outside of the Covenant Ship level, a rehash of Halo 2's Midship). There's not a single snow, jungle, desert, rain forest, moon, volcano, tropical island, beach or mountain top level to speak of. Not even a recreation of classics like Zanzibar and Beaver Creek. Additionally, they've completely removed vehicles from 4v4 slayer and have lumped single player objective and single player slayer into one playlist called ""Rumble Pit."" So, if all you want is the classic Halo experience be prepared to have to endure tons of annoying and poorly conceived Juggernaut and Infection game modes instead of being able to play what you actually want (NOTE: Bungie moved Infection to its own playlist, making Rumble Pit a more enjoyable experience).

On a positive note, Invasion is a great game type (especially Invasion Slayer which is simply the best idea Bungie has had) and the inclusion of credits, new armor pieces and the daily challenges are awesome and keep the game's replayability up. Furthermore Bungie is an active participate in the community and makes changes based on usage data, such as putting Team Swat in it's own list. This benefits both the people that love and hate that game mode simultaneously.

Firefight:
I don't understand the point of Firefight Matchmaking. This was the best aspects of ODST and while that Classic Firefight option remains in a non-credit earning, challenge completing, matchmaking aspect, the main matching system only allows you to play ONE ROUND with infinite lives. Where's the fun and/or challenge in that?

Forge World:
Easily the best aspect of this game as it expands on Halo 3's innovative Forge design by allowing you to build your levels from the ground up in a massive world rather than be limited to existing maps. The file share system is great and though clunky at times, it's rewarding to make your own map and play it with friends.

Conclusion:
While there are pretty cool ideas (credits, Forge World and Invasion) the game is largely a gimmicky cash-in riddled with rehashed, tired ideas and lacks the polish, content and new ideas that Bungie's faithful deserves.",positive

2472,"Ok, I really had high hopes for this game, but it gave me mixed feelings in the end. I honestly feel very disappointed and let down. Far Cry 3 was an amazing game and I thought far Cry 4 would top it, but it didn't.

Pros:
- Awesome gameplay and open world experience
- You can make your own decisions for the character
- Graphics were amazing

Cons:
- Disappointing storyline (Far Cry 3 made you understand the pain of the character and it gave you a purpose, you had to find your friends and family and save them from their demise. In Far Cry 4, the killing seems pointless and unnecessary. I don't see why we had to even fight in the war.)
- GLITCHES EVERYWHERE
- Game freezes a lot
- Ends WAY too abruptly (Right when you finally kill Pagan Min, it goes to black and ends right there. There's apparently nothing more to the game. It felt like hours and hours of gameplay lead up to nothing.)

The game is so average.  I mean it has far cry 3's engine which is great... but I couldn't get into the story.  I could see someone loving it if they were a comic book fan or like the nostalgia of 80's games?  The game made me laugh maybe 2-3 times (it's supposed to be really corny) but most of the time I was just meh.  I don't know if I regret purchasing it but I was underwhelmed.

2475,"I first played Sonic Adventure in 2000 on my Dreamcast.  Loved the new style of sonic games and for its time, it was revolutionary.  And so I bought this game just last week, mind you the last two games I purchased were Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Brothers and I had to compare them at least unconsciously.

Here is what I noticed, the camera angle sucks.  It is shaky and all over the place.  Some of the levels feel that more could have been added so that they could feel ""tighter"".

That out of the way, the character recreation is amazing.  I like the personalities and different abilities of each character is given, the music is upbeat, and to say a long story short, it was hard to put down the controller.  While Mario Galaxy I find it difficult to get more than 3 stars a day and want to go on... but then again that is me.

This game is rated as one of the lowest gamecube games and because of it I feel alot of people have been missing out on a flawed classic.  Just to let you know, all of the games I buy I feel are excellent and so I've shoved this game in my dresser next to Metroid Prime and the Ocarina and Master Quest games.",positive
2476,"First of all, the gameplay.  The game is definitely difficult and some of the puzzles are potentially real stumpers.  Some degree of mathematical insight is certainly required to solve them.
One problem I have with the puzzles is that they are not logically arranged.  For instance, after progressing some distance through the game you reach a point where you have to return one (and perhaps both) characters to the point where they started the game to obtain something necessary to continue the game that cannot be obtained at the beginning.  There is also an object that can be obtained from the beginning that is not essential to progress beyond the start of the game, but becomes vital later on, and it would be easy to leave the beginning without obtaining it.  Problems like that add to the difficulty of the game.  Things are made easier, however, by a limited number of inventory items, and the fact that if you hold the right inventory item for performing a task the computer automatically selects it for you.
Several of the puzzles are mathematically oriented.  While I can usually work out mathematically related puzzles, I still can't determine the logic behind one of them (translating the old to new co-ordinates) as it seems that in the alien number system you carry numbers between some columns but not others.  Another difficult mathematical puzzle, the triangle puzzle, was rendered impossible in my game by the graphics not being good enough to show the readings on the relevant instruments.  This forced me to revert to a walkthrough to solve these puzzles, which was unsatisfying.
The rest of the puzzles generally were solvable (although a lot of logic needs to be applied, including drawing up lookup tables to determine patterns etc) but often lacked a real logic to them in terms of game story (like the houses which you must enter twice but leave once).  This is in contrast to the puzzles in the Myst series, which are closely ingrained with the storyline and make good sense in the context of the universes created.  The puzzles in Schizm seem to be there purely for the sake of vexing and perplexing the visitor, which is unsatisfying in terms of storyline.  The storyline also doesn't make an awful lot of sense (there is a very contrived explanation as to why your two characters can't see one another, even when standing next to each other), but what the heck.
I also had a real problem with the acting, which is appalling.  If you think the acting in most computer games is bad, you'll think it is Oscar material compared to that in Schizm.  I understand that the actors are not natural English speakers, but the game makers could at least have cheaply hired a voice actor to overdub their lines.
Now some technical points.
I bought the CD version of this game.  As many of the reviews below indicate, this game was initially designed for DVD, and has suffered in the translation to CD.
The biggest problem is the graphics.  The game has a lavish production design but the compression required to convert the game to CD has resulted in blurry and indistinct graphics at some points.  Mostly this is merely an aesthetic problem, but when you can't read numbers on dials or key sets of co-ordinates, it's a much bigger issue.  Were it not for walkthroughs I simply wouldn't have been able to solve one of the puzzles purely due to bad graphics.  There are also some objects which were very hard to distinguish for the same reason.
Unless you do a full install of all 5 CDs (which I would highly recommend, although you will need lots of disk space) you will need to change CDs frequently.  One thing adding to the problem of swapping CDs is that you control two characters who must be moved independently - so when moving both characters from location A to location B you need to walk each character along the path one at a time.  It would have assisted if the programmers had enabled you to move both characters together, and included a 'zip' mode as there is a lot of pacing back and forth through familiar territory.
Finally, there are more quicktime movies containing hints that are on the DVD version but are not on the CD version.  The DVD also has an additional puzzle.
All in all - it's a difficult adventure, but if you want to be able to solve it yourself you may have big problems using the CD version, due to graphical problems.",neutral
2477,"To sum this game up in a few words, ""not much new to see here.""  This is an at most 30 dollar game(prob better off as a rent), and thats assuming you like playing the campaign/spec ops.

Campaign 4/5- Was nice to see the story come to an end, kinda a mixed bag, alot felt been/here done that, while there did seem to be just enough interesting things throughout the story to keep it interesting.  This is very short lived however, as eas can be beat in 4 hours, and youd be lucky to squeeze 10 hours out of a veteran play through(took me 8 taking my time).

Spec ops-5/5 Has the missions just like MW2 had, I personally enjoy these quite a bit.  If you didn't like these on MW2 though, you're not going to like them here either.  There are only about half as many of these as on MW2, but they added a survival mode which i found quite addicting, and where ive got 80% of my playing time invested.  Not having the ability to play with 4 people here is really frustrating.

Multiplayer-1/5 The reason you prob want this game, and this game delivers..............the worst experience yet.  Its all the things that killed mw2 noob tubing, overpowered guns, ridiculous perks and maps that could make a Monk Swear.  If you like camping and/or fighting every battle at knive distance then youll love the maps.

2478,"No Jax & Daxter

Review for adult gamers with only a few precious game hours per week.

I loved the original Jax & Daxter, so I snatched up Jax II as soon as it hit the shelf.  What a mistake!

In terms of gameplay, Jax II really doesn't have much in common with its predecessor.  As it has been stated in most ever other review, Jax II use the GTA style of mission based game play which I find quite annoying.

In Jax & Daxter, the game as divided up into three different worlds.  You could solve the quest in just about any order you desired until you gather about 75% of the all the orbs in the current world to open up the next world.  If you weren't particularly good at a specific quest, no problem, you could move on to something else.  Not so in Jax II, the quest are pretty much linear.  Rarely to you ever have more than two missions you can ever choose from.  It's typical to get stuck on both and spend hours trying to move on.

Another reason I thought Jax & Daxter was clever was there were no guns.  It was cute without being kiddish.  J&D had attitude without being in your face, and Jax didn't talk.  All that cleverness is completely gone in Jax II.  Most of the mission require blasting things with big guns, that are annoying to use.  Jax talks.  The gothic thing just doesn't work.

As it has also been said, moving about the city and using hover cars is down right tiresome.  There's too much traffic and the cars don't control very well to have any real racing fun.  Some missions are simple and others are next to impossible and not all that much fun.

For adult gamers with few gaming hours per week, don't bother.  You won't get very far in this one.  Leave this for the hard core kids and single adult males with no kids.",neutral
2479,"I like red dragon mice because of the very grippy material they use I feel works best for gaming. I already have the mammoth red dragon mouse but wanted one with more buttons. First, the side buttons are not in a good position you can only comfortably hit the left 3. The middle buttons are pretty useless as they are basically flush with the case the really need to be raised a bit more to easily feel them so all 4 of them are pretty useless.. the top left button is much closer than the mammoth one so that one is fine. It also has no left and right click on the scroll wheel which i feel is pretty essential for a gaming mouse. The main issue I have overall is I use a palm grip and find this mouth to narrow compared to the mammoth.

2480,"i found the sixaxis rather numb for this game. it is very easy to overcorrect due to lag from controller/game(?.  i did improve somewhat with practice but the end result is still not very satisfactory. since i am not one of the dedicated thumbolinas who live to do fine motor movements with their thumbs on consoles, i really had hoped the sixaxis would be implemented well but this is an older game and the sixaxis functionality had to be programmed in recently, i suspect. i am looking forward to Warhawk and B.A.II - which hopefully were written to take full advantage of sixaxis.",positive
2481,"If you like the first one for the Playstation 2 then you will most likely like this one. AS you know if you own the Network Adapter you can go online. Improvements over the first game include a better physics engine, better graphics, a first person view, rider customization, and of course the online gameplay. However I do have some major complants. The online aspect of the game feels somewhat rushed, beacuase it doesn't include a lobby. Also when playing againist computer opponents, they can knock you off your bike, but you cannot even toch them. Overall this is an average game and if you liked the previous title, then go ahead and pcik this one up.",positive

2484,"I have played every game since its inception. I have also owned every special edition too. What I struggled with this series so far... is the guardian galaxy. Im not a fan of their weapons, or characters. They look great, but perform poorly. Master Chief and Cortana were a magical duo. I remember spending hours with friends playing halo 1-3. Nastolgia is a word that comes to mind. Unfortunately this particular Halo gets lost in transistion. I feel its trying too hard to accomplish too many things at once. I get that they're trying to give us a break from the MC. However, we don't want that, or at least I don't want that. For some reason I miss the challenges of the covenant and the flood. It was also creepy, I remember the first halo when you meet the flood for the first time. Or 343, not the company but the character. Theres no memborable moments that the original conquest set out to do. I want development, not conflicting paths, and weird aliens. Home is where the heart is and the covenant and cortona aren't its main space. I do love the graphics, ( I got the collection series ).

I also play all of them on legendary and this game has got some points more than other that get so retarded hard it makes me not want to play. I have always had a challenge but never like this to where Im finding loopholes in the game. I enjoyed clearing out a section of foes, and moving to the next.

The Ai is really hit or miss. Sometimes I just watch them when they're trying to heal me just stand or turn around despite me signaling for help. Not as bad as sheva and Chris off of RE5, but not as great as others.

343 really needs to approach a new game, with organic enemies that bring back the sense of fear, heroism and bad-assery that we come to love.

2488,"Kind of limited and not without a few big big big flaws.

I bought this for my Pokemon Y game from Walmart and have previous experience using older Action Replays and GameSharks.  Like previous cheating devices, this PowerSave device is a pretty flimsy cheaply made piece of plastic so handle it with care.  The biggest issue (I think) is the actual cable that comes with this device though.  For the first 2 days I was able to connect my device to the downloaded program occasionally but now the program doesn't even realize that something is plugged in which is why I decided to write this review.  Before the device was constantly losing connection even when perfectly still but now it's as if it doesn't exist.  I ordered a $5 mini USB cable off Amazon so hopefully the issue will be resolved.

As for the cheats - they're okay.  You don't have to search the internet for long codes that ""hopefully"" work.  The maker of the device kind of limits what cheats you can use though.  I can no longer teach any Pokemon any move I want as with previous devices.  I can't do stuff like walk through walls either because of how the device actually functions.  I can get a few cool thing like event Pokemon though.

Overall this thing sort of gets the job done but there are many bumps along the way.  Definitely not a 5 star product.

UPDATE: I bought a $6 mini USB cable from Amazon and the product works pretty flawlessly now so the issue was definitely the cable.  If you are stuck in a ""loop"" of being connect and unconnected or you can't connect your PowerSave to the program you downloaded then try getting a new cable for sure.  Datel didn't spend a penny extra on the awful cables they provide.",positive

2490,"In Rise of Legends, you play through strategy fights in a world full of robots, magic and guns. It's an odd mix of Renaissance Europe with mech warriors.

There are three campaigns you can play through. First comes the Vinci. Are we surprised that, with all the Da Vinci Code hype that is going on, that we get a Vinci campaign immediately? I'm surprised that they didn't say things like ""Unlock the CODE of your Da Vinci hero ..."" :) Your brother has been slain by an evil enemy, so you and your armies are marching across the lands in order to seek revenge.

The other two campaigns are involving the Alin - rather middle-easterny - and the Cuotl - who fall more into the Aztec / Maya realm. Each land has its own terrain types and units.

The graphics are really quite good. You have detailed trees, tufts of grass, shadows under your floating blimps, turning gears and glowing crystals. The sound is reasonably good, with an epic-like quality to it at times, but it never overwhelms the gameplay.

I realize that most strategy games give you two or three main character types to work with - the GDI and NOD, the Orcs and Humans, and so on. Still, for some reason it felt like there were ""too few"" sets here. Maybe it's because when I'm playing in ""real world"" based games I usually get the choice of several nationalities. I really wanted there to be more options to work with.

I think part of it could be because Rise of Nations was huge and gave you a lot of variety - but this ""sequel"" now limited it greatly. It would be like Risk coming out with Risk II - but now saying ""you only play on Australia and you can only be laser-shooting Aztec troops"".

Still, the game is a lot of fun to play. If you're into strategy games, it's well worth giving a try.

2491,"This is a fun game to play.  My three year old son has really enjoyed beating up the bad guys with his sword.  It has some reading, but it really isn't necessary to be able to read, since you just follow the arrow to where you need to go.  He has really enjoyed it so far.  The story line is that you are basically on the other side of the crusades and the Templers are the ""bad guys"".  So you are an assassin killing off the Templar.  Not exactly the ""team"" I really would be on, so it is probably best my son can't read just yet.  Other than the storyline, the game itself is fun.  The graphics are good, the game play is good, and it is overall a fun game.  Just be aware of the story line.  This story line could be very touchy especially in today's world with the strife still going on in the Middle East.  Now the assassins strap bombs on themselves and blow themselves up in crowds of people, hoping to take out their targets.  The ""holy war"" still continues today, unfortunately.  This is why I had to give it a lower grade then it would have received from me.

I hope this helps with your decision to buy this or not.  For some the story line may not be a big deal and just want to play a fun game, for others it could be a big deal.  So I wanted to make you aware of it all.",positive

2493,"Like most here, I believe the first Resistance was an excellent game, that blended WWII sensibilities with aliens to make something fresh and rather excellent.  The sequel looses those elements and makes a rather generic game. The game itself is well made, the graphics are an upgrade over the previous one, the controls very tight, and some genuinely good boss fights make the experience well constructed.  But there's feeling of something new or fresh, or even the feeling left with the first.  Perhaps the creators thought it would be better to advance the game and make it more like other FPS, but in so doing they lost their special magic.  I didn't like the limitation now placed on holding weapons.  More often than not, I was using the same weapon the whole game to get through it, rather than using whatever weapon may be fun at the time.  The story was more like Halo than the first game, and I was not thrilled with the ending.

Overall the game is well made, executed and everything is good on paper.  If you're looking for a FPS in general you won't be disapointed, but if you're looking for an improvement on the original, you'll probably be disapointed.",positive
2494,"I bought this game strictly because of the awesome reviews I have read about it. When I got it and popped it into my DS I was slightly disappointed. The story mode is absolutely useless. There are 3 modes where you travel to different planets, but it's generally all the same thing. There is nothing motivating you to keep going. I enjoyed playing against my friend who owns a DS, but other then that, this game doesn't really hold it's own. I tend to gravitate toward puzzle games that have story lines like 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. I am a huge puzzle fan and Meteos just doesn't hold it's own in my opinion. The graphics and sounds are cute though. Not horrible, just not the best.",positive
2495,"As of 3/12/13, the game still has major issues. The servers are getting better but are far from perfect. The game is extremely buggy. The game still will not play at full speed due to server issues(cheetah speed disabled). I do enjoy playing this game when it works. That being said, anyone who hasn't purchased this game yet, hold off until everything is functional and the bugs are worked out. If amazon hadn't given a $20 credit for pre-order, I would still be waiting to make the purchase.",positive
2496,"It's a worthy addition to the franchise, but the controls are a bit frustrating, the story and characters are not as good as they were in previous installments (except for Star Wolf!  LOL!).  Multiplayer is actually pretty fun (or it was back in the day).

StarFox 64 was lightning in a jar.  A tough act to follow for sure, but this game felt like a swing and a miss!",positive
2497,"The game is improved in everyway over the original, but as far as changing the way starcraft is played, don't expect any differences here.

The first difference is the graphics, and they are much better then the days of old, but unless you zoom in, they look little different then most space RTS that have come out in recent years (namely Dawn of War I and II).

The second major difference is the campaign mode. The interface and story telling mechanics are much more detailed, engrossing, and overall better.

The similarities are where the infuriation comes in however. The game plays online, and off, exaclty like the old game. fend off a zerg rush and build, gather resources and build, and repeat. My great problem with the game is a sense of deja-vu that I've done it all before, and if fact, I have. Some new units help the equation, but in essence the new units meerly replace old ones that were removed, and don't greatly change the gameplay.

So, if you liked the first game, you will like this one, if you didn't then stay away.  If you never played the first one, there are better RTS out there already to try.

My suggestions would be Company of Heroes, Dawn of War II, and Supreme Commander II.",positive

2499,"The best part of GH Aerosmith for the Wii is the guitar. It's the same as the GH3 guitar, but with an Aerosmith faceplate.  Too bad the bundle costs the same as the PS3/Xbox version, although all the hardware technology (motion sensors, wireless, etc) is in the Wii remote, but that's also true of GH3.

The song choices are extremely poor.  I'm a fairly big Aerosmith fan, but I tend to forget that over their 30+ year career, they've made a lot of less than stellar songs.  Somehow, a lot of these songs managed to find their way  into the game.  Also, the graphic quality is poor, even compared to GH3 on the Wii.  Don't expect Steven Tyler and Joe Perry to look as good as Slash did in GH3.

Overall the game's a pretty big disappointment, and the negatives seem to be things that could have been easily fixed.",neutral

The Xbox 360 is a really awesome console, one of the best compared to the Wii and Ds. It has really good software and it makes download easy and efficient. While playing games there no lag,crashes,freezes,or reboots making it great for game play. You can download music,games,apps,videos. The Xbox in my opinion is the perfect console for game players like me.
I like to lay in bed while playing it the controllers make it easy because they are wireless. The only things I don't like is that memberships cause money but its worth it. What I Like about it the most  is it play Ds on it not like the Wii. Not so recently got my grandpa to play this with me,he doesn't like video games. When I got this for Christmas I was so excited and couldn't wait to play it, It was easy to set up and and easy to learn the controls. While playing other consoles I experienced:lag,crashes,freezes,reboots and system overheat. I think this is the best console sold in a long time.",positive

2505,"It's important to note that the PX4 isn't Playstation specific. As long as you have a device with an optical port, the audio portion of the headset should work (the microphone is a different story). For example, I plugged the PX4 into my PC's sound card and it performed just as well as when plugged into my PS4. Keep in mind that the USB cables are for power, not connectivity.

On the PX4 wireless transmitter, there's an optical ""out"" as well as ""in"". Because of this, I was able to plug my PS4 into the optical ""in"" port, then plug another cable in the ""out"" that went into my Yamaha receiver. That way, I can have the PS4 play through my speaker system AND headphones. I say AND because, technically, you can do both at once. There's no switching back and forth. If I want just the headphones active, I simply turn my receiver off; and vise versa.

The wireless transmitter signal isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. I plugged it into the computer in my office, then walked out to my couch. Even with the door open, the signal broke in and out. Since I planned to use this for PC gaming with my home theater projector -- and I didn't want to move my computer -- I purchased a 25' optical cable and ran it through the ceiling, which did the trick. That said, most people will have the transmitter in the same room as their gaming system; it does fine for that.

Note that I use the PSX on my PC with the extended optical cable, but tested it fully on the PS4. For regular PS4 use, I have Turtle Beach's Call of Duty: Ghosts Ear Force Phantom, even though it says it's made for the Xbox 360 (I know, crazy, right?). The PSX headset itself feels a little cheap when compared with the Phantom and my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corsair-Vengeance-2000-Wireless-7-1-Gaming-Headset-CA-9011115-NA/dp/B007ZZ6OW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corsair Vengeance 2000 Wireless 7.1 Gaming Headset (CA-9011115-NA)</a>. That said, it's lighter on my head compared with the Corsair and the Phantom costs around twice as much, so keep that in mind.

The optical cable that comes with both the PX4 and Phantom is extremely thin. I suggest investing in something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mediabridge-Toslink-Cable-6-Foot-Optical-Digital-Audio-Cable/dp/B004LSNF04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mediabridge Toslink Cable (6 Foot) - Optical Digital Audio Cable</a>, which should provide better sound quality. On a positive note, Turtle Beach does give you a really long USB charging cable. The idea is if your headset battery runs out of power, you can plug it in and still be able to play at a distance (something most bluetooth devices don't allow).

Another thing to consider is that there are two items to power. (1) The wireless transmitter, and (2) The headset -- when charging. That means there are two USB cables that need to be plugged in. On the PS4, there are only two ports, so you have to use up both. Don't expect to use the same charging cable as your controllers either; they use micro USB whereas the PX4 uses mini (same as PS3, though). And because the ports are in front of the PS4, it makes for an ugly, octopus-like setup. So I picked myself up a powered USB hub and stuffed it behind my media center. That way I can power the transmitter and charge the headphones while keeping the cables hidden. Too bad Turtle Beach doesn't provide an AC adapter themselves.

The sound quality on the headphones is pretty good, and there are 6 different angle presets, depending on the type of game you are playing. In addition, you can connect a bluetooth device to listen to music or chat with your friends over the phone. But don't bother trying to connect the headphones to the PS4 via bluetooth. For whatever reason, Sony doesn't support stereo headsets; an update I expected to see on the fourth generation console. And right now the microphone isn't supported via PS4's bluetooth either (you have to wire it to the controller). That said, the microphone IS supported on the PS3.

PS4, PS3, PSX, PC . . . Oy, so many similar sounding acronyms; hopefully I haven't lost you at this point, but I wanted to give a detailed account of different uses. Overall, this headset is pretty good. It gives you a full stereo solution that Sony refuses to provide. The build quality isn't quite what I'd expect for the price, but the functionality and features more than make up for it. If price isn't an issue, I highly suggest getting the Call of Duty: Ghosts Ear Force Phantom instead. If you don't have the extra money, then I don't think you can go wrong with the PX4.",positive
2506,"I have followed the NFS franchise for some time now. I have played just about every edition, with some disapointments in between. The fact you can choose upgrades is nice and makes the game interesting as you strive for better performance and handling. This game is very similiar to the PS2 version, but with better gameplay. The fact you can get points for taking down other drivers, gives it a nice Burn Out twist that will surely make you want to play more!

2508,"After reading many of the reviews on Boogie Superstar, including mentions of its potential as a good workout game, I decided to pick up a copy, and I'm glad I did! Prior to this game, my favorite game for a fun but effective dance workout was ""Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party""'s ""Dancing With Dweebs"" game. That's still one of my favorites, but this game is my new alternate dance workout game.

Many of the reviewers of Boogie Superstar mentioned that they found either the cover versions of the game's songs annoying, or that they had issues with the inconsistency of the game's tracking of your movements via the Wii remote. I haven't found myself to be terribly annoyed by the songs (yet), but that may change as time goes on... So far, though, so good. Since I don't spend a huge amount of time listening to much pop music, the covers don't bother me quite as much as they normally might. No, they're obviously not the originals (EA would've probably had to shell out HUGE amounts of money for the rights to use those), but they're really not that bad, in my opinion.

As for the game's accuracy in reading movements made with the Wii remote, however, I have noticed that what's been said before has proven to be true for me, at least as far as one particular dance move goes - sometimes the game reads your movements as accurate, sometimes it reads your movements as being off, even when you're doing them the same exact way, time after time. Since, for me, it IS just one dance move that the game tells me I'm doing wrong, it may truly just be that I'm not doing it right, instead of the game misreading it, but either way, I'm often having so much fun with the dancing that I really don't care enough for it to stop me from playing.

As far as the karaoke part of the game goes, I can't speak to that, as I haven't bothered to try it yet. I don't have any USB game-compatible microphones laying around... I'm considering picking one up, just to try that aspect of the game, and to use it on my other microphone-using games, but for right now, the dancing is my main focus.

Visually, I enjoy watching the mini-movies in the game, and overall I really enjoy the cartoony look of everything. The animation in the game is GREAT, especially where the characters are concerned. I'm always blown away and very entertained by watching the super-smooth and fluid movements of the characters as they dance and move. I think the customization options are perfectly adequate, and love that I can adjust color schemes as I choose. Kind of reminds me of EA's Sims games, as does the non-language spoken language that the characters use. Neither one of those features bother me in the least, and I like feeling that I'm actually part of a cartoon-like world when I play this game.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this game, and I'm having TONS of fun dancing with it. I had ordered a copy of ""Just Dance"" just prior to opting to pick up ""Boogie Superstar"" (which I found online for about fifteen bucks, brand new, without the mike), but I decided to skip ""Just Dance"" and see how this one played. For the current pricing on Boogie Superstar, I think it's well worth the cost, and I kind of find myself wishing that this game hadn't been discontinued. It's a pretty fun game, once you give it a chance!",positive

2510,I bought a used PS Vita from Game Stop. The hand held console would cramp up my hands after playing for  awhile. This hand grip designed for my Vita worked great and made playing on the system more comfortable. The only issue which is not a big deal as it does not happen very often is when the Vita is packed up in say a back back for transport the little lock does not always hold the Vita in place. It has never unlocked while playing. It is worth it to have this Hand Grip.,neutral

2512,"I bought this as I used to have a Logitech G500 which was a great mouse. I wanted to continue in that fashion and try wireless for the first time.

Pros:
- I like all the buttons and their placement. I don't seem to have a hard time differentiating between them all
- The smooth scroll is worth it. It is weird sometimes the scroll wheel will ""bounce back"" even though I didn't want it to
- I like the option of wired / wireless
- The texture is nice and I liked the weight of the mouse
- I like that you can put the dongle into the mouse

Cons:
- The cord to connect / charge is a bit stiff.
- The software that it comes with is somewhat un-intuitive
- The battery life is horrible, even on energy savings, it should get better than this

Overall I like the mouse but I don't use it as much as some more hardcore people do. Also I don't really change dpi's much or utilize macros. You're probably wondering why I bought it when others would do but I just wanted to try this mouse out and it worked well enough for me to keep.",positive

2514,"Remember those nightmares you had as a kid? The ones where you hid from the monster and watched panicked as he passed by? Or the ones where you ran from him but you seemed to run in slow motion where he ran at full speed? Welcome to Alien: Isolation. There are many threats in Alien: Isolation from fearful humans who shoot on sight to malfunctioning androids but by far the worst is the alien itself.

The alien is invincible. Don't bother trying to shoot it, hit it, stun it or even run from it. Your only option is to hide or avoid it. Hiding is something you'll do a lot of. There is nothing worse than hiding in a locker and peering out through the slits only to see the alien peering in while trying to figure out of someone is occupying the space. The music switches over to something that seems like an ode to certain death as the alien hisses and growls until it decides there's nothing in there and moves on for a few brief moments. Other times you'll crouch under a hospital bed to see the things feet and tail. Then it stops and starts to sniff. It looks at the top of the bed and turns to the left and right. If you aren't lucky it then looks under the bed. You can track it with a motion tracker in an effort to avoid it but sometimes it boils down to luck. Sometimes it seems to be behind you only to soon be in front of you. Sometimes it sees you right away while other times you are certain you will die because there is nowhere left to hide and it will decide not to enter the next room and instead go up one of the air vents. Sometimes you will have to use the air vents too...

Even for the aging 360 the graphics are well done and the game makes nice use of atmosphere. The idea of crafting items is well implemented and gives you a sense of needing to ration every last piece of scrap you find. My only complaint is that those with a 360 slim IE four gig will not be able to play the game without either a hard drive or a 16gig flash drive. It takes up about ten gigs of space after you download all the ""install packs."" Yes the game must be totally installed on the drive in order to work. If you use a flash drive you will have to install each ""Install pack"" manually telling it each time to install to the flash drive or it will default over to the internal four gig flash drive and run out of space. The game gives no warning about this either on the case or on Xbox Live. Other than that it's a great game and well worth a play through.

2520,"As soon as you start the game, you know that Snake's Revenge is a very different Metal Gear game. For one, you start off the game with a Beretta and a knife as opposed to your bare fists. For the first few minutes of the game, you'll be walking around the forest, dodging spot lights and strange flying craft. The storyline in this game is not as strong as in the first one. Also, the atmosphere in Metal Gear was so much more drab and menacing, wheras Snake's Revenge is full of bright corridors and sunny outdoor environments. This time around, it seems that the developers were more concerned about variety than game-quality. There's a train, a desert fortress, a bridge, a jungle, and many other locales. The newest addition to this game, though, is the use of a side view. The side view can be interesting at times, but I overall wish they had left it out. But to me, the most frustrating part is the end. After defeating the ending boss, you go out a door and arrive at door number 1, door number 2, and door number 3. I've played this game for hours and hours on end and I could NEVER figure out how to open them. Weapons didn't work, or even security cards. But in addition to that, you can backtrack through most of the game. Overall, Snake's Revenge is a good game for the NES, but it just didn't capture me the way Metal Gear did.",negative
2521,"I'm in my 20s and really love sims games on the PC. I usually play them for a couple days at length and then get bored and forget about it...revisiting them occasionally. I did the entire sims castaway game and LOVED it. That one I rented and was able to finish in a week or so. Since I had already done in on the nintendo DS, I pretty much had it figured out.

 I've never played my sims, but when I saw my sims kingdom coming out, it sounded really fun so I put it on my wishlist and my parents got it for me for xmas. At first I was a little unsure -- because I don't like to spend $50 on a game and then feel guilty when I don't play it. I usually get the majority of games at the library to try them out first.

I feel no guilt about my sims kingdom because I'm addicted to it. I've played for more hours then I want to admit and I think I'm still only 1/2 way thru. Also, I will mention this is a single player game and you need both the wii-mote and nunchuck to play.

In the game, you are a 'wandolier', which makes you a special person with one of the coveted wands of your kingdom. You're pretty much a public servant and go from island to island in the kingdom helping other sims rebuild, redecorate, etc. In order to get the things you need to do those tasks, you must find certain items,fish, and go mining in order to complete the scroll which allows you the 'power' to do the task ahead of you. Hopefully that doesn't all sound horribly confusing.

It is story based, and you do get screens where your sim and others will converse back and forth so that the game can give you the information you need to complete all your tasks on that particular island and open up other islands.

The only thing I've noticed is that some islands are darker and harder to see then others. I personally liked the playful, bubbly islands better if only because it was easier to see around. Hopefully I will complete this game soon, because my boyfriend is about to admit me to a sims addiction facility.",negative

The graphics are good (but not great) and the physics are for the most part realistic and believable. The controls are easy to pick up and the tricks are fairly easy to complete. Splashdown contains a good mix of upbeat music and the gameplay should keep you occupied for a decent amount of time.

2530,"Great limited edition! I have bought the collectors/limited edition for Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and this is by far my favorite one. Despite the statue being made out of plastic the build of it looks great though the lighting could have been better since it doesn't really illuminate Batman completely. Also as a word of warning to anyone buying this please do not use the batteries included with the statue, they are cheap and complete crap to be honest. I had them in my statue and after about being on for an hour my statue went dead, upon inspection I found out that one of the batteries exploded and caused a mess inside the battery compartment. The artbook is great, also love a great artbook when it comes to limited/collectors edition, best part of the artbook is that it's a hard cover artbook unlike most included in collectors/limited edition games. which are paperback and flimsy. One great feature that is a rare inclusion for collectors/limited edition is that despite including a Steelbook and game also came with a regular copy of the game normally most collectors/limited edition that comes with Steelbooks just include the game and DLC/reading material in the Steelbook itself. Overall it's the perfect Limited Edition to close out the Arkahm series. Highly recommend to anyone who is a big fan of the game/Batman and those who had their orders cancelled for the Batmobile Edition.",neutral

I wasn't holding out much hope for the game but I was extremely surprised at how well I enjoyed playing it. True the graphics aren't what you call top notch, but they aren't as disappointing as some reviews claim. The storyline and the twists to the storyline from the responses you make, make this game truly interesting! Do you let the so-called villian live or do you finish him or her off! Your responses will ultimately change the results of the game to some degree. At these prices how could you go wrong, unless third person RPG's aren't your thing!!!! I highly recommend this game and only wish it was received better when released. My understanding was Obsidian canceled the sequel to this, too bad!!!!",positive
2533,"Shadow the hedgehog is a good game. the only problem i see is the different versions. the xbox and ps2 versions are bad, the xbox has no co-op and the ps2 has slow framrate. but the gamecube version fixes these problems

people complain about the following problems: slow framerate, poor controls, guns, swearing, vehicals. let me say this now... THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT THAT BAD!!!!!!!

to start, the framrate sucks in the ps2, it's a little better in the xbox version, but is almost non existent in the gamecube version.

the controls are FINE! i see nothing wrong with them. the exception is the homing attack. it can kill you once or twice but that's it. the new speeds just over loads their brain so they can adjust to whats happening, but the common person can adjust.

now for the guns, YOU CAN CHOSE TO USE THEM OR NOT! FWI, you don't have to use them you know! there is only 1 or 2 levels that mak you use them, but its in a certain mission. if it's that bad, skip the level all togther. the replay value so high here, you can do all most all the levels without guns. IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF DEAL!!!

now the swearing problem. true it's not ""family appropiet"" like it should be, but if you're a hard core player, it's awsome. it gives the game edge and life.

Finally the vehicals. again like the guns, YOU CAN CHOSE TO USE THEM OR NOT! but again, 1 or 2 levels make you use them, but they're not stupid vehicals like a sports car. they're cool vehicals like an alien bird or hover disk.

if you're over 10 years old, consider this game, for it's worth the time and money.",negative

2537,"this game, just annoys me to the point i don't want to play it. the term Metroidvania doesn't do it justice if anything it insults the Metroid name because everything in Metroid is about exploration and everything is deliberate. SotN just teases you in the first part of the game and annoys you all together. so, at the start you play as Richter Belmont, picking up from Rondo of Blood, or Dracula X in the west. you reach Dracula and enters chessy voice acting. so your like oh ok, i can dig this, but you're already fighting dracula so what else is there to fight? fast forward a couple of years and now enters Alucard, running through the forest and jumps the gate. awesome scene, now your in control and this guy has a powerful weapon and armor. so everything just dies in one hit! yeah! just as powerful as Richter. then its taken away from you. that. is. so. not. cool. why the big tease?? where in development they thought was a good idea to show players Alucard's powerful equipment then have it taken away??  then the sense of direction. oh my god, after that big tease you follow the path and then after a while you explore but you can't because you need a relic to open blue door, but you need to find the relic, but you don't know where to find it! you find those relics laying around only that they supposed to be in the game already! not a fudging relic to show enemies names or the damage! its cryptic and its not known where to go. then the spells, its never told that you can cast spells to gain small health and summon a spirit. however! moving away from the negatives i will say that the soundtrack is amazing, and the graphics have aged well. its an ok title, much like Simon's Quest this game isn't for everyone and i'm almost done playing the game and i feel i've wasted so much time getting lost i just want to fight Dracula and get it over with! that's the point isn't? to get lost, waste time, get powerful, and then comes the endgame boss, your pretty powerful already, so you'll be disappointed on how the boss fight came out.

overall, its an ok title, but to me its just more annoying than fun, i'm already level 21 and majority of the boss fights are becoming easy, but i'm nearly done with the game, so i have to beat it now. its a game that just wastes you time, all games are, but this one and simon's quest just literally wastes your time like no other. the portable games of Castlevania follow this formula now, which is disappointing. just try this game out for 5 minutes then you'll see what i'm taking about. its also an XBLA title so you can find it pretty easy or pay for a PS1 title.",neutral
2538,"This was a great game, overall.

The characters-Having played Coded, I wasn't surprised to play a KH game in which you can play as Sora and/or Riku. Sure they level up separately, but it's still fun playing as both. It may have been disappointing that there were no world specific party members, but the spirits in the game made up for that.

Story-It was shorter then Kingdom Hearts II, but still a amazing one. I wonder how Kingdom Hearts III will top this....

I can't say I wanted to know anything about Dream Drop Distance before I bought it. I'd definately reccommend it, though there are spoilers from the previous games in the series in the form of the chronicles option in the momento section of the main menu. Not that it's a bad thing.

2542,"The third and final installment of the Zero Escape trilogy gives the series a proper sendoff.  Hands down the darkest story of the series, ZTD has its share of disturbing, cringe-worthy moments with often graphic deaths on and off screen.  The overall psychological tone is pretty unsettling as well.  There are signature escape room games as in the prior entries that don't disappoint as well as the visual novel aspect.  The big difference here is that the characters communicate via fully-rendered in-game cutscenes rather than the relatively stagnant character portrait against a background style of the first 2 games in the series.  This adds to the emotional impact of the game.

Why 4 stars and not 5?  2 words:  ZERO JR!  The absence of this insane, sadistic, ill-humored, yet iconic and lovable antagonist from the previous game is a bit of a step backward.  There just isn't a show-stealer of the same magnitude as that...that...BUNNY in this final chapter!

Not to worry, though.  Having the casts from the previous 2 games unite here makes this a fitting conclusion to the series, especially when prominent relationships are revealed.  Though not every single plot thread is spoon-fed to the player, there are enough jaw-dropping revelations to leave us with a satisfying end.",negative

2545,"I'm sure you're one of the Grandia fans from PS2 days and look forward to the same great experience. I doubt you'll be disappointed, and hope my review will cover all the bases so you know what type of games Grandia III is.

First of all, this game had all the hype it needed. There weren't any commercials or anything that made the game seem better then it is. This game brought back feelings of playing the first Grandia (PSX) as well as Lunar: Silver Star Story on the Sega CD. The first 5 hours spent playing this game I was blown away and remembered how fun the battle system was. It's been a while since I played an EXTREMELY good non-Square-enix game. You see...t.his game is made by Game Arts. Thank them for the Lunar series as well as Grandia on the original PlayStation. Even though most people are buying this to pass time til' Kingdom Hearts II, this game really IS worth buying. However, the game is very cutscene drivin' which so far, doesn't bother me at all. The cut-scenes are very well done with a great GRANDIA feeling. Not at all like Xenosaga, which was coldi in its portrayal of the characters. This game has spirit and life; you'll enjoy the plot advancement as well as getting to know your party of heroes.

It's games like this, that really make me wonder what else Square-enix can throw at us. It's going to get better and better each game. (Again, GameArts made this game but S-E was the publisher). I think Final Fantasy XII could be a revolutionary step between action and role-playing games that will bring in more fans. Star Ocean wasn't good enough. Neither is Tales of Legendia. Grandia III has the idea, but I believe FFXII will be _the_ game, but G3 will help you pass the time well.

Sadly the game only last about 30 hours...over two discs...short indeed, but last about as long as the story is going to hold it. There are not any side-quests really or anything extra to unlock. Very straight-forward game, but that doesn't mean it won't hold your attention.

Grandia III has finally brought back whats good in the series after Grandia Xtreme and the PS2 Grandia 2 port. This game has really brought me back to the series and has shown me that when square enix wants to they can breath life into a seies that was thought to be dead. grandia 1 and grandia 2 for the dreamcast were amazing games. but the recent ps2 efforts were not very good. Grandia III does face some problems story wise(it gets worse in the second disk), but players should not play the game for the story, but rather for the battles. They have now added a new way to equipt skills and magic along with a brand new system which allows arial attacks. the graphics are probably the crispist on the playstation 2 (sorry final fantasy). So where the story drops the game play makes up for it.

The music could be better, but the battles have a thrilling drive that makes you want to fight. Not run from battles, but get into them. Speaking of which, you won't have to waste time building levels, unless you don't have a hang of the battle system.

I'll leave the story for you to find out. It's an adventure that's not as up to par as previous games, but nevertheless it has Game Arts written all over it. Pick up this game for a rental if you doubt you'll want to own it. I'm proud to have bought this and will play it over a few months down the line with no less enthusiasm. Now if only they would begin work on LUNAR 3... maybe someday.",positive

2547,"tl;dr version: if you are a ME fan, then play the game for sure. It is a little bit of a letdown but the heart is still there. I originally gave it a 3, and while I still say it is buggy and needs improvements ... the story and massive amounts of quests is certainly keeping me busy. I am definitely getting my money's worth.

I expected a little more in terms of graphics and game play, but the truth is I play it a lot.

I have a system well above the minimum requirements and the graphics on high are just sloppy. Character's hair are rendered poorly and chins bleed through shoulders. When characters drink a beer, it looks terribly fake.

Some examples of poor game-play:

1) If you hit M to view your map, you can't hit M again to get right back into the game, you have to hit ESC to go back to the menu and then ESC again to get back to the game. Same for the journal and codex and inventory.

2) The inventory management leaves a lot to be desired.

3) When buying/selling gear, there is no way to tell what you currently have equipped and if what you are looking at is better or worse.

4) When developing something, there is no way to tell if you already developed it and/or have it in inventory.",neutral

2549,"Its a nifty little console, however, it makes a really menacing grinding noise whenever its loading a disk, I'm not sure if that's normal because I've never owned a Dreamcast before, and It also sounds like the internal cooling fans are having a hard time cooling it. I'm glad I made the purchase, however I am uncertain of the longevity of its life.

It arrived in a medium sized box, and it had like, 20 layers of saran wrap on it, which was kind of annoying to peel off, but I suppose it did its job in keeping the console safe, and the console itself is only a little bigger than the controller.

I highly recommend this console. I gave it a 4 because there's a few errors with my console, but only minor ones, like having to reset the internal clock EVERY TIME I turn it on, long loading times on games, the grinding noise, which I might add, my PS2 started making before it died, and the cooling fan. I feel like I should also add that it had a bit of trouble picking up the controller the first time I used it, but that was easily fixable.

Overall its a great console that I would recommend to people who want to experience some history in gaming without the loss of content from an N64 cartridge.",negative

2551,"Ten months ago, the Madden NFL franchise from EA SPORTS made its debut on the new console generation with the launch release of Madden NFL 25 on Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One.  While the game was improved over the version released in August on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, it was an in-between effort which ultimately proved to have limited staying power, particularly compared to other sports games released in the same window.  Even though this years Madden NFL 15 saw a limited development cycle, the end product has proven to better embody the expectations of a new-generation title, sporting improved gameplay and graphics which help offset deficiencies from legacy gameplay issues and overall career mode shortcomings.

Gameplay
As a tenth anniversary of sorts from Madden NFL 05arguably the last title of the franchise to put significant focus on the defensive side of the ballMadden NFL 15s primary gameplay improvements come on defense.  Each level of defense has seen improvements, beginning with the defensive line play.  The War in the Trenches got a start on the offensive line in Madden NFL 25 on the new consoles, but in Madden NFL 15 the defensive linemen are shown some love with a complete overhaul of the control inputs.  Pushing R2/RT while controlling a defensive lineman makes an attempt to anticipate the snap and get momentum going against the offensive line, and then pushing X/A or Square/X while engaged attempts power and finesse moves to get off blocks.

When not engaged, basic tackling has also seen changes in the game.  A vision conecalling to mind the QB Vision Cone of Madden NFL historyprojects from the player being controlled on defense.  The cone shows the tackle range of the player, and pushing X/A attempts a conservative tackle while pushing Square/X or using the Right Analog Stick attempts a Hit Stick tackle.

In practice, both the blocking interactions and tackling make for a user experience which better engages the player in the defensive side of the game.  In Madden NFL 25 particularly, defense felt like an afterthought and was nowhere near as fun to play or as balanced compared to the offense, which had run blocking and Precision Modifier gameplay controls which led to more shootouts than close games.  By contrast, Madden NFL 15 gives defenders a weapon in the War in the Trenches to create a more organic pass rush and force quarterbacks into making tougher decisions which enable the linebackers and defensive backs to have more impact on the game.  After being frustrated by feeling like my inputs had limited impact on defense in last years game, I feel just as engaged on both sides of the ball in Madden NFL 15.

Madden NFL 25s defenders had some fundamental issues in coverage last year as well, with zone coverages being particularly easy to beat in the passing game and running backs able to Run Free (as the marketing tagline suggested) particularly in the power running scheme.  On multiple occasions in last years title, I was able to run in excess of 200 yards with a running back with 7 minute quarters on All-Pro because of how poor the end containment was by the AI defense.  Madden NFL 15 tightens up this weakness, funneling running backs towards organic holes in the line for more realistic gains (though big plays are still possible).  On the same settings, reaching the century mark is a considerable achievement in this years game.

The balance of the passing game feels improved as well, with both zone and man coverages appearing to work with more success year-over-year.  Linebackers and defensive backs make smarter reads, and seem more able to get their hands on the ball for deflections and interceptions.  Unfortunately, interactions between wide receivers and defensive backs have still not received much attention; if youve been frustrated in the past by receivers not fighting back to break up a potential interception, or by receivers making catches in traffic too frequently while sandwiched between defenders, youll find similar results playing out this year.  On the same topic, youll find little change to the number of penalties and variety of penalties called on default sliders; only penalties occurring as a result of direct user input like offsides and false starts seem to be happening.

Another focus of the gameplay design in the passing experience was to increase pass inaccuracy to help differentiate the elite signal callers from their backups, as well as to allow for new and varied catch animations to play out by receivers and defenders alike as they attempt to make plays on the ball.  In past games, passes were essentially either perfect or off-target; there was no grey area in-between.  Expanding the range of outcomes makes the game more organic; a ball slightly off-target can require a receiver to make a more difficult stretch for the catch, limiting the ability of the receiver to pick up yards after the catch once theyve re-set their feet to run.

While this inaccuracy seems to work as directed for user-controlled players, even on All-Pro difficulty with default sliders the AI quarterbacks can go on superhuman runs of completions.  Regardless of the ratings involved, a quarterback can complete in excess of 80% of their passes, even when a significant pass rush has been generated to disrupt them.  Sliders and gameplay tuning may be able to tweak this experience, but at present the inaccuracies are hit-and-miss for the AI.

The last input-related gameplay tweak comes on special teams, where a new interface has been crafted for kicking and punting.  Controls are still the same with regard to the use of the Right Analog Stick to load up a kick by pushing down and then flicking up in time with the meter, but a visible trajectory can now be seen (on difficulty levels lower than All-Madden) which is affected by the wind.  Also, moving your directional indicator for the kick skews the path of the Right Analog Stick movement (think of how shots are handled in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 14 as an analog), so if you're not straight on with a kick, youll have to move the Right Analog Stick slightly off-center to adjust.  The forgiveness for kick accuracy is directly tied into your kicker or punters ratings, leaving a small window of error if your players aren't up to snuff.  These changes make long field goal attempts anything but a sure thing, and make the decision-making process all the more involved when you're facing the outside edge of your kickers range.

Outside of these gameplay elements, a number of other changes have been made with regard to playable camera angles and on-screen menus and displays.  Pressing up and down on the directional pad pre-snap will cycle between cameras, running the gamut from up-close views suited best for running the ball to all-22 views which keep all players on the screen at all times.  On defense, a special camera also focuses just behind the player being controlled, including the ability to use player lock on a single defender throughout the course of a play.  The ability to use a different camera on any given play at the touch of a buttoninstead of having to go through menushelps give the user more control and tailor their view towards whatever camera gives them the most visual feedback they need based on the play they're running.  Although Ive continued to use a default camera more often than not, more options are always preferable to not having options to work from.

The playcalling screen has also been re-done, and as you cycle through your playbook you will have ready access to information about why a particular play would be suggested for the current down and distance scenario, or how many times youve called that particular play and what the average result has been.  The game also draws from overall community metrics to provide statistical data on what plays the Madden NFL 15 have been calling and what the results have been.  The new structure will take some getting used to, even for long-time fans of the franchise, but overall it does a better job of providing the information a player needs to be confident in their playcalling from snap-to-snap.  Its also worth noting that tempo controls (allowing you to speed up with No Huddle or slow down with Chew Clock) are available in the playcalling menu, and that Madden NFL 15 has adopted the NCAA Football No Huddle system of being able to access your full playbook instead of just being limited to certain plays when you hold Triangle/Y to send your offense into No Huddle mode.

Finally, pre-play match-up data has returned to the series in a manner similar to last years NCAA Football 14.  Holding R2/RT and pushing the Right Analog Stick up or down opens a radial menu which displays the head-to-head match-ups between each potential receiver and their corresponding defender on the field at a given time.  This allows you to exploit any potential mismatches, which helps if you're playing with personnel you're unfamiliar with.  You can also use the radial menu to view the current fatigue levels of your players as well as the pass protection and run blocking match-ups of your offensive line against the defense.  While this amount of data might be overwhelming to novice players, the ability to access the information allows players to be as well-informed as they want to be as they play Madden NFL 15.

Despite the issues noted here, one thing Ive been impressed by thus far is Madden NFL 15s ability to give me a good challenge at All-Pro difficulty without slider tweaks.  In an offline Connected Franchise Mode with the Cleveland Browns, my week two match-up against the New Orleans Saints at home resulted in my first-ever tie in Madden at 24-24, in a see-saw game which saw Drew Brees begin the game by throwing two interceptions to rookie Justin Gilbert before the Saints settled into the game.  Late in the fourth quarter, I needed a fourth down touchdown pass from Johnny Manziel to Jordan Cameron to go up by a field goal; the Saints managed to drive into field goal range and tie it up as regulation expired.  In overtime, I drove to the three-yard-line but a fourth down pass attempt to win the game outright fell incomplete, letting the Saints take possession needing only a field goal to win.  I traded defensive stops with the CPU, and then I stopped them at midfield with just over a minute left in the extra period.  The Saints pinned me at my own 5-yard-line, and I wasn't able to get into field goal range before time expired.  Even though the end result was a tie, it was probably the single best experience Ive had against the AI in Madden NFL in years.

Overall, the biggest achievement of Madden NFL 15s gameplay is making the user feel as though their inputs actually matter on defense again.  Controlling defensive linemen is actually fun again, and defense no longer feels like a frustrating interlude between offensive drives.  The gameplay is still not perfect, and there are lingering legacy issues readily apparent to players who have been yearly buyers, but the amount of progress observable year-over-year makes for an enjoyable experience.

Presentation
Those of you who are familiar with my impressions on sports video games over the years know that I take Presentation very seriously, and my take on Madden NFL 25 last year was one of disappointment compared to what the EA Tiburon studio had been able to achieve compared to what was present in NCAA Football 14.  While Madden NFL 15 still lacks some elements of the last college football games broadcast package, attention to NFL Films-inspired Presentation has done this years title a good service.

This year, the broadcast presentation is even more clearly inspired by the NFL broadcast package put together by the CBS coverage, which makes sense given the returning commentary team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms.  Orlando-based sports reporter Larry Ridley leads into each game with a quick game story before the broadcast switches to a chrome model of the stadium which quickly reveals the full-color, living and breathing game.  New quick video packages accompany quarterback run-outs for their first drive, and both coach and player models have been updated to better reflect their real-life counterparts.  Sideline reporter Danielle Bellini continues her role in reporting on injuries in a voiceover-only fashion, while a halftime show returns to the game after being absent last year.

The halftime show comes closer to NCAA Football 14, though it doesnt quite match it yet; overall team stats are compared before a selection of key highlights are narrated by Larry Ridley.  All in all, its more of a halftime show than weve been used to in recent Madden NFL titles, but it still has room to grow.

Commentary seems to have less repetition this year, with more lines available for Nantz and Simms even when introducing the same quarterback at the start of multiple games in a row.  There are still some issues with commentary being behind the action, or oddly quiet on big events, but it is an improvement from last years title.  On the plus side, crowd noises seem to have gotten better since last year, and the crowd in general seems to respond better to big plays, especially as the crowd members stand up to cheer on long runs or interception returns.

Broadcast has influenced Madden NFL 15 as well with subtle additions, such as showing a kicker warming up on the sideline when on a drive at the end of the half or the end of the game and gauging the kickers range.  Just like watching a NFL game on TV, a line displays on the field to show where the offense will need to get to in order to be in range for a game-tying or game-winning kick.

One touch which will likely end up polarizing the community comes in cut-aways at organic moments like a player injury, the end of a quarter, or the calling of a timeout.  The broadcast will fade to commercial before coming back, and occasionally when it comes back there will be an overlay which plays a quick advertisement from an NFL partner (including Verizon, Papa Johns, and other companies).  The ads themselves are not lengthy and can be buttoned-through to get back to the gameplay, but Im sure there will be an equal number of fans who like the evocation of a real game broadcast and an equal number who will come down hard on the game for including them.

Madden NFL 15 has also added player montages which focus on a particular players performance in-game during a break in the action, but Ive only seen one such montage trigger thus far out of my time playing the game thus far.  The montage opens with the players character model tossing a ball in the studio in a manner similar to Madden NFL 25s pre-game lead-in before moving onto highlights with narration; the one montage I saw was short and unobtrusive, but Ill be interested to see if any tuning happens over the course of the game so that these can happen more frequently.

The revamped player models and face scans are the stars of Madden NFL 15 on the field, as more player body types are now represented and muscle definition comes across better.  Helmet and uniform details are also improved, and a good number of NFL stars have had facial scans completed and put into the game.  San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernicks in-game model is the prototype for future Madden NFL player models, as he obtained the rights to his tattoos to ensure that they could be recreated in the game.  Although its admittedly strange that his character model is the only one with ink in the entire game, surely EA SPORTS is hoping the attention to detail will spur other players to get tattoo rights as well so that more players can have those elements added to future games.

For as good as the player models look, Madden NFL 15 still suffers from some of the same issues with regard to players stacking up and pinning one another on the ground at the end of plays.  This is forgivable because interactions between players are generally sound during actual plays, but from a Presentation standpoint it still sticks out in a game that looks otherwise strong from a visual standpoint.

Unfortunately, one of the Presentation upgrades which helped to set the NCAA Football series above Madden NFLits Studio Updates and BottomLine score tickercontinue to be absent from Madden NFL 15s Connected Franchise Mode.  With these elements having been part of the college football franchise for two games, its continued omission from the NFL game is disappointing to say the least.  As a result, the games primary career mode lacks an overall connective thread within the game state to tie all 32 teams together.  If there could be only one major Presentation-related addition to Madden NFL 16, I would personally want these elements to be carried over from NCAA Football.

Also, while there are some nice touches in presentation in CFM for the player teammenus that show a snapshot of the upcoming schedule, or comparisons of player performances from one game to the next stand out in particularthe problem, as it is across the board, is that there isn't enough done to flesh out the AI-controlled teams, which serves only to further break the illusion of a full 32-team league.  If more of these elements tied in other teams in the league, the presentation would feel more authentic to a true NFL broadcast; with the scope limited to a single team, the user cant help but feel isolated, with very little connection to the league as a whole.

Finally, Presentation fans can finally celebrate the demise of the last-generation Jumbotron graphics which had long overstayed their welcome in the Madden NFL franchise.  Gone are the days of generic graphics displaying on the Jumbotrons and a post-game graphic of the home teams logo with LOSE emblazoned over it if they lost the game.  EA SPORTS worked with the NFL teams to get a better sense of the graphics used in each of the stadiums, and the end result is a small touch that goes a long way towards making the game a better representation of the NFL stadium experience.  Whether its playing at Heinz Field and seeing the scoreboards ketchup bottles turn the Jumbotron red when the Steelers enter the red zone, or whether its just Jumbotron messages imploring the crowd to be quiet while the home teams offense is at work, theres much to be impressed by in the environment of each in-game stadium.

In terms of Presentation, Madden NFL 15 takes a number of significant strides compared to Madden NFL 25, but there are still elements left to carry over from previous EA SPORTS titles to complete the visual and audio experience.

Game Modes
As in the past two years of the series, Connected Franchise Mode remains the career experience for Madden NFL 15.  Users can select to play the mode as a single Player, as a Head Coach, or as an Owner to be responsible for various tasks through the course of multiple seasons in the league.

The two most notable additions to CFM this year come in the form of Game Prep and Confidence.  Game Prep tasks occur on a weekly basis, with a bank of hours being available across the team based on how many days there are between games for the team; this is meant to replicate how bye weeks give teams more time to prepare and build their skills.  Depending on who your opponent is and what the current state of your team is, youll be tasked with activities both on the field and off the field to build your players XP or Confidence heading into the next game.  The concept is sound in theory, but in practice there are some issues; for example, the number of hours available rarely align with the cost of the Game Prep activities youll undertake, leaving hours in your bank which cannot be utilized in any given week.  Also, undertaking a Game Prep activity costing 8 hours will use 8 hours per player, even if the drill or task would involve an entire team unit; presumably this is meant to discourage against artificially improving a team too quickly and unbalancing the league, but it stands at odds with how practice would work in real life to improve multiple players at once.

Confidence is a new rating exclusive to the CFM experience which attempts to replicate the ups and downs a player faces over the course of a season.  A player who wins a starting position on the depth chart after previously being a backup will get a Confidence boost, while a quarterback who throws multiple interceptions in a loss will see their Confidence take a hit.  Youll even see some wide receivers take hits to their Confidence if they don't feel like they're being utilized enough in a game, encouraging you to spread the ball around.  All players start at a baseline 50 Confidence rating when the season begins, and movement up or down will help to boost ratings or see other ratings negatively affected.  This is another element which is sound in theory but seems a bit off in practice; for example, the game seems to occasionally have trouble recognizing when a player has been affected by performance issues which would have a Confidence effect.  For example, in my CFM after Week 1, my kicker was docked 2 points in Confidence due to missing a field goal; the issue is that he hadnt missed a kick of any kind in that opening game, meaning the game was unfairly penalizing me within this new system.

CFM has seen a number of other tweaks as well, including a simplifying redesign to the Buy Packages screen where players use XP to upgrade their ratings, the ability to Sim directly to various points of the season (or all the way through to the offseason), the creation of 100% randomized draft classes to avoid cheat sheets where players were able to figure out the best players in each class without scouting, and the ability to track Progression and Regression for your players in the games menus.  As a whole, however, CFM faces a similar issue to whats been holding it back since its introduction; the menu setup and overall tracking of tasks and information is convoluted and can be too much for a new player to handle at once.  The main CFM hub is spread across over five separate menu screens, and options which are on separate screens can end up leading to the same places.  CFM also faces the issue of making your game feel like its part of a living, breathing, 32-team National Football League.  If you brave the menus, you can find out standings, injury reports, big news stories, and other developments, but theres no one-stop-shop like a weekly highlight recap show to solidify your teams place in the overall league.  This is a reminder that having access to Studio Updates and a BottomLine-style news ticker could unite the CFM experience.

In other modes, Skills Trainer returns with tutorials and drills meant to teach players the in-game controls for on-field action and making hot routes and audible adjustments, but in Madden NFL 15 it takes things a step further by actually addressing football concepts.  Over the course of 19 topics, the game will provide instruction on different types of defensive alignments and coverages, along with plays and routes which can be used to combat that type of defense.  As somebody who has long advocated that the game should take steps to teach players about football and not just how to play Madden NFL as a video game, these new options are a much appreciated addition to the games general on-boarding process for both new gamers and veterans alike.  The concepts and drills introduced in the Skills Trainer also flow into the strategy of the new playcalling systems, and playing through all of the Skills Trainer tutorials will make you even more aware of why plays are being suggested to you in a game and why they are or aren't successful based on the defense you're playing against.

One other new facet of the Skills Trainer suite comes in the form of The Gauntlet, an arcade-style game mode which draws upon some of the lessons learned in Skills Trainer as well as special boss battles to challenge Madden NFL 15 players to successfully complete multiple levels before they lose all of their lives (which are lost when a level is failed).  Some levels in The Gauntlet will require you to successfully complete a pass within a certain area of the field, while the boss battles might call on you to kick a field goal from your own end zone with hurricane-force winds at your back.  For a simple concept, this mini-game is definitely addicting, players can expect to spend considerable time trying to beat their previous high score in The Gauntlet as they attempt to continue their mastery of the game.  As somebody who used to love the mini-games which were available in Madden NFLs days on the PlayStation 2/Gamecube/Xbox, The Gauntlet is a welcome diversion which still has training value.

The popular and profitable Madden Ultimate Team mode features in Madden NFL 15 again, with an emphasis this year on refining the basic UI menus and Sets (formerly Collections) of the fantasy game mode to make the entire experience more straightforward, whether the player is a MUT Master or just trying to figure out what the big deal is.  Solo challenges return and aim to provide a way for players to build up a winning MUT team without having to spend money to do so; special mention must be given to the overhaul of this game mode, which helps to significantly simplify the on-boarding process as players begin their time in MUT.  While the mode left users to essentially figure things out on their own in the past, there are very well-established paths for players to follow as they begin building their team, and even somebody like me who hasn't been interested in the mode in the past has admittedly been won over and committed more time to the experience than I wouldve thought to invest before.  If ever there was a year for novices to get hooked on MUT, the effort put into making the mode more user-friendly makes this a prime opportunity for new adopters.

While not a mode, the CoachGlass feature introduced in Madden NFL 25 exclusively on Xbox One makes its return this year, but is no longer exclusive; PlayStation 4 owners with the PlayStation app downloaded to their smart phone or tablet will be able to use the second screen function to access this companion for Madden NFL 15.  The new version of CoachGlass expands its feature setno longer limited to the defensive focus of last years iterationand informs Madden NFL players of such varied information as their opponents trends in rushing and passing the ball, as well as the ability to quickly view their opponents personnel and how much of a go-to player each person on the field has been in the game.  The utility of a second screen tool like this will vary from user to userI personally found it a little hard to go back-and-forth from my phone to my TV in a useful mannerbut having it available on both of the new-generation consoles is definitely a plus this year.

Finally, the GMC Never Say Never Moments return for Madden NFL 15 and it is expected that three moments will be added each week of the NFL season to allow players to recreate (or reverse) scenarios from close or otherwise interesting real-life game results.  In an unsurprising but perhaps unexpected move, Online Team Play appears to be absent from the game mode suite; that mode, added in Madden NFL 11, saw few updates in the years since then and was even buried within the game menu of Madden NFL 25 last year to the degree that many players likely thought it was gone already.

Overall
As a whole experience, Madden NFL 15 is a game which has peaks and valleys throughout its on-disc offerings.  While there remain some frustrating legacy issues in gameplay and Connected Franchise Mode still struggles to present the unified NFL experience gamers are looking for, at the end of the day Madden NFL 15 succeeds at something that I thought was going to be a difficult achievement: it makes defensive play fun again.  In fact, the experience of actually playing the game in general is vastly more enjoyable than last years entry, and perhaps more so than any release in the last few years of the series.  The further development of Skills Trainer to incorporate the instruction of real-life football concepts, combined with the creation of an addictive mini-game in The Gauntlet, provides optimism for the direction that the Madden NFL franchise will continue working towards in the future.",neutral

What I like about this, is that they made a lot of stories, and stuck to the original but made it more complex, so you get a in depth story.

Cons:
* I wish they stuck with how they made DW3 and DW4, with body guards that you can train and they become elite.
* the graphics are not that great compared to other games
* it lags a bit when you play with two players
* story line gets repetitive
* They make all the players look to young now, kinda stupid.

Pros:
* a lot more story modes to play
* weapons are a lot better and no one can share a the person special moves which makes the each player's weapon unique to only himself
* challenges gets harder once you play more
* new characters
* updates on the maps
* switch weapons.",negative

2556,"*** GAME REVIEW ***

infamous 2 has a pretty big set of shoes to fill after the success of the first. It seemed like it would be hard to improve upon the mechanics of the first game. Yet Sucker Punch studios managed to find a way, and produce a worthy sequel to Infamous.

GAMEPLAY
If you have played Infamous then you will feel right at home with Infamous 2. Not much has changed gameplay wise from the original except for loads of polish. Your character will keep his powers, avoiding a Metroid or God of War scenario, and earn additional powers throughout the game. Climbing mechanics, aiming, melee combat all feels more fluid and lively when compared to the original. You will explore a brand new city, take side quests and missions, find dead drops and shards... its all here all over again just with a new coat of paint. On top of new powers to unlock, Cole now has access to THE AMP which allows him additional combat moves especially with melee. To top it all off the map now has some destructible elements which add a nice bit of devastation to Cole's attacks, and goes along exceptionally well if you decide to take the EVIL path.

One thing that does put a damper on the gameplay however is the camera mechanics. This time around the camera got in my way a lot more than it did in the first installment, especially when it came to melee combat with the amp. The camera gave this really nice comic book effect sometimes, giving nice low angle close ups to the fight but it also cut off my view of oncoming danger; and sometimes when jumping would go behind a building or wall leaving me blind to my position. While not a major problem it does put a tiny damper on the gameplay

GRAPHICS
A big time improvement over the first game, and overall the game looks great! The graphics are rendered exceptionally well, and the effects of Cole's powers never looked better. The best part of all is the new city. It looks magnificent when compared to the previous. There is a lot more activity and visual effects going on that really do make the city feel more alive. It is a major improvement over the first title I feel.

SOUND/STORY
Sound wise, the game is very lively. Cole's powers have a lot more effect to them and overall the game just sounds great. Voice acting is of high quality in my book. The new voice actor for Cole at first might seem out of place, when compared with the original, but it grew on me over time. Story wise the game has a decent story, on par with the first game. Like in the original you can chose to be Good or Evil depending on your actions making for two endings and in a way; Two story arcs each leading to different sets of skill upgrades and storyline elements.

REPLAY/LENGTH
Depending on how obsessed you get with collecting shards, dead drops, side quests etc the game should take you anywhere from 14 - 17 hrs. Replay value is exceptionally high! Not only do you have both a Good and Evil storyline to complete, but shards, dead drops, side quests all return and then some. If you loved the first you will have no problem playing though this game twice with ease.

There is also an online element to Infamous 2 which allows you to create and play user created maps/content. While the controls and implementation of the creator do need some work (in my opinion) the level of creation available is high. Given some time expect to see some wild user-generated content online!

OVERALL A- ... 90%
Infamous 2 does the original game justice. It doesn't change the formula much, instead just improving upon what made the original a greatest hit; while also giving it a nice face lift graphically. Throw in new super-powers, user-generated content and online, and you have yourself a winner. While Infamous 2 is not a perfect game, it does more than enough to make itself out to be a powerful, high quality title well worth the price of admission.

*** COLLECTOR'S EDITION CONTENT REVIEW ***
Spending a little extra $$$ to get the Hero edition might be a worth while investment if you are an inFamous fan; but that all depends on if you like what you get.  Included in the Hero Edition is a plethora of goodies bound to at least impress at first glance but are they worth your money?

Included in the Hero Edition:
1. an 8.5"" Cole statue.  The statue is pretty decent quality though Cole might seem a touch small as keep in mind the 8.5"" is including the height of the rooftop he is standing on
2. inFamous 2 video game (this one is fairly self explanatory!)
3. DC Comic ... inFamous #1.  This comic is a prequel to inFamous 2 taking place just after the first game and provides a little more backing into some of the characters
4. Additional Skins and Powers.  You will receive both the Reaper and Kessler skins as well as the Lightning Hook and Electrocution Grenade ability
5. All 4 AMP skin variations
6. inFamous 2 official sound track

*7. The big boy of the package deal... an inFamous designed Sling pack.  This pack is pretty good quality I'd say.  It opens on the left side via a zipper compartment and has plenty of space to store stuff.

So overall is the Hero Edition worth the current(6/7/2011) $40 investment?  Depends on how you feel about the items and collectibles.  The bag is the real $$ item here, as the statue, comic, and DLC included is stuff you probably would get in a $10 or $20 DLC w/ some sort of gimmicky item like a plasma cutter or little toy sackboy etc.  Instead we are getting a nice, usable sling pack.  So it comes down to if you really want a sling pack.

Personally I wouldn't lay out the additional money for the Hero Edition because of the pack. It is the kind of item that I toss in the closet and forget about since I have no reason to use it.  That is me however; the pack is decent quality and I could see it being a usable item for every day use to carry some school books, a laptop, random stuff... perhaps even a Ray-Sphere if you come across one.  With that said the Hero Edition is more for die-hard fans of the game, someone big on collectibles, or if you want a collectible Sling Pack.

OVERALL I give the package a 80%.  The included content is nice and goes along great for a fan of the series, but at $40 it amounts to a collectible Sling Pack, figure, soundtrack and a Comic for the most part.  Not for everyone, but if you make the investment you won't feel robbed at all.. especially once you see that Sling Pack.

** FINAL VERDICT :  Hero Edition as a whole.. including the quality of inFamous 2  scores an 85%(B/B+ aka 4.5 stars).  The game is a delicious cake and the Hero edition is the icing. While this package is not for everyone your $$$ will not be wasted on the investment.",neutral
2557,"I owned the first SWBF and was a great game with easy controls and gameplay. I sold that to by SWBF2 and have been dissapointed. The missions are darn near impossible, the sniper scope view finder is a joke and why would the game use smaller fonts and display in blue, I cannot even read what it says on the screen now and im playing on a 60"" tv...did anyone test this game and check the blue letters?

I must say if your purchasing this to play the game rent it first its really tough past the first couple of missions. If your main goal is play LIVE by all means buy the game, the graphics are nice and I have had no lagging problem online like the first release. The live version is 5 stars all the way but just don't expect to see who took you out because its so hard to read now......",neutral
2558,"This game brings Max Payne back to the gritty, dark world that he was famous for in the first game. Rockstar knows how to make these types of games, and Max Payne 3 shows. The story is nothing out of this world, but very detailed and believable. The gameplay is easy to get used to quickly, and the fight scenes and gun battles are very intense. This game is rated M for a reason - the language and some of the story elements are definitely for adults only. It was a good game to play from start to finish, akin to a dark action movie you'd see at the theater.",positive
2559,"Heavy Metal: FAKK 2 is a fantastic half of a game. I can only imagine what the experience might have been like had the developers taken it upon themselves to finish the rest of it. After all, you could make your way through FAKK 2 in a single sitting if you were patient enough. Add to this a slow beginning which has you running from place to place, chatting with boring NPCs, and fighting nothing but buzzing flies, and you might expect that the game isn't worth your time. However, you would be incorrect about that, because, after all, FAKK 2 won't take very much of your time, and that which it does consume will have you gleefully slaying all kinds of bizarre monsters in the name of justice... or whatever. (When you're playing a female warrior with a leather thong and slew of blood-letting weapons, you can guess that the story is a bit on the expendable side.) Combat is ferocious, gory, and addictive. In 2000, it was novel for a character to use two weapons at once (a sword in one hand and an uzi in the other, for example), and though many games have borrowed this concept since Heavy Metal's release, few do it so well. Once the action begins, it won't let loose of you until the end - which, again, comes far too soon. If FAKK 2 still wore a [...] pricetag, its brevity would make it hard to recommend. Now, at a budget price, however, it cries out to be played. The graphics may be aging, but they're still pretty, and the gameplay rocks. If you missed this one, do yourself a solid and grab a copy. It won't keep you busy for too long, but you'll have an enjoyable ride while it lasts.",neutral
2560,"This game has a great solo campain but the multi-player is where it is at in my opinon. There is a lot of weapons to choose from as well as characters and unlockables.

2567,"Works, cheap, and has smooth performance.",positive
2568,"Final Fantasy 12 is a very good game.  It is very good even judged by the high standards set by its peers.  But it does have some significant flaws.

Story (7/10) - The first half of the game set the stage for a very solid storyline.  The presentation of the game is outstanding - the voices are a remarkable improvement over the poor voice acting from FFX.  The interaction between the characters feels very realistic and was enjoyable to watch, with a solid balance of serious, emotional scenes to witty and well timed humor.

However, the high expectations for a solid story and and well-developed characters is not met in the second half.  The most glaring story deficiency is surprisingly found in the ""main"" characters: by the end of the game, you really start to wonder why Vaan and Penelo are sticking around.  They don't contribute much at all to the main plot, and their young age compared to the other mature party members really begs for a better explanation of why exactly their running with this rag-tag crew.

Graphics/Sound (9/10) - The graphics of Square's latest Final Fantasy is superb.  Prior installments of the Final Fantasy scenes really show the developer's improvement in the realm of computer animation.  The character movements are much more detailed and realistic, leaving behind the awkward body gestures from FFX.  The sound effects are your standard rpg fare (I'll admit I'm not a big audophile, and can't really tell the difference of sound effects from one game to another), and as stated above, the English voice-overs are really excellently done.  The sound track is an extremely pleasant departure from the overly rehashed Nobuo Uematsu themes that have plagued the series the past few iterations.

One small complaint would be the lack of diversity in terms of enemy models.  After 60-70 hours, you really start to tire of hacking through the same Malboro/Skeleton/Wolf mob models that are recycled throughout the entire game.

Gameplay (8/10) - Square really rolled the dice on this game and it payed off.  The real-time gambit combat system is a marked improvement and evolution from Final Fantasy's turn-based roots.  The gameplay features smooth, uninterrupted breaks from travel to combat, a welcome relief that takes much of the hassle of battling away from the prior FF's.  Still, Final Fantasy's first flirtation with real-time combat suffers from two significant flaws:

1) The gambit system is imperfect.  FFXII's combat system relies a lot on the gambit system, which basically involves the player ""scripting"" its AI for its characters.  Three party members battle simultaneously, and the combat takes place in real-time (except the player can pause to issue a command), which means much of your party's actions are done automatically.  However, for simplicity's sake, the gambit system is very basic: you can issue simple conditional and prioritized commands for your AI controlled characters.  For example, you can create a gambit that causes a character to cast ""poisona"" to cure poison on a party member when he/she has been poisoned.  The drawback for simplicity is that in certain situations, you'd like to have more refined conditionals.  Sure, if a character is poisoned you'd like to cast poisona, or if a character is blind, you want to cast blindna, but if a character is poisoned AND blind, you'd rather cast the high MP cost Esuna, which would clear BOTH blind AND poison.  Because the simplicity of the system, you can either set it up so it'll cast the two spells, or set it up that you'll always cast the more mana intensive esuna, wasting mana in situations where you only need to cast one spell.  Similarly, if one character is afflicted with a status effect you might want to cast esuna, but you kind of wish that you could write a gambit for the condition where TWO party members are afflicted with a status to cast esunaga instead (which is an area effect esuna spell).  Another similar problem is encountered when scripting healing spells.  By the end-game, I've scripted healing gambits to cast Curaja, which heals in entire party.  The condition is when a party member is below 50% health.  Obviously, if two party members have health below 50%, you only need to cast once, since it's an area effect spell.  But there's no way to script that with the simple gambit system, and if I allow the game to go full auto, two spells would be cast, wasting a lot of mana. The speed of the combat system makes it really tedious to micro-manage all these events as well.

2)  Spell casting is poorly done.  For some reason or another, the game mechanics make it impossible for two spell animations to be on screen at once in certain instances, meaning that if all the of your party members have a spell queued, the first animation will go off, and while it's going off, the other two characters will just sort of stand around: problem being, the enemy is still allowed to do regular attacks.  So if you're casting something with a fairly long cast animation, the enemy will be wailing on you in the meantime, making it regular attacks preferable, in case you need to get an emergency heal off.

Another minor complain I have is that the character progression system, the license system, means open-ended character creation, which sort of takes away from the character development of the individual characters.  It'd be preferable to have a class system where the character's combat abilities reflected the character, like Vaan, the street theif would have theif abilities like steal, and use weapons like daggers.  Instead, it's possible to turn the small framed Penelo into your hardy tank class, which kind of doesn't make sense.  And by the end-game, you'll have acquired all the licenses for all your characters, making them identical for all intents in purposes in combat.

In conclusion, FFXII is a solid Final Fantasy game, in a series with many outstanding iterations.  However, contrary to the way many reviewers paint the game, it is not a perfect game.",positive

2570,"This game is cute, but won't last long. it is pretty monotonous, mostly brushing and cleaning animal, feeding, and cleaning up poo. you can compete after a while, but its of limited interest. Might be nice for a young girl who likes horses. As it wasn't very expensive, its probably just right for the price.",positive

2572,"The nunchuk controller is a unique way to play games.  It's disconcerting at first to have your hands apart, rather than hanging onto a controller and operating two thumbsticks.  But then it rocks, especially in games like Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.  The accelerometers inside the nunchuk make it more than just a one-handed thumbstick.  You can toss it forward and yank it back to pull objects in the game.  Super-freaking cool.

My only complaint about the nunchuk is that it feels unfinished, sort of plain.  It's just a smooth hunk of molded plastic.  There's not even a Wii logo.  It seems almost like a prototype.  It sounds stupid, perhaps, but it needs a bit more flair.  Maybe a ""grippy"" surface or something.

But... it does what it's supposed to do and does it well.",negative

2574,"When the first Assassin's Creed game out I was excited and gave it a try, but I was quickly disappointed.  This game has the similar premise of the back story and mix of the technological side of going back as the assassin to learn from history (which is a neat premise).  The graphics in this game are really good and the cutscenes and actual gameplay alike are sharp and very clean.  The mechanics of the game are simple and the sneaking and killing is easy to do.  I do find when dealing with multiple assailants it is a bit tougher and I find it hard to switch between attacking each one (it seems to want to go to the nearest one and moving the joystick toward a specific target does not always change target).  Other than that the game is smooth and navigating through levels and dealing with assailants is clean and simple.

The story is really good and you can quickly get an attachment to the assassin and what he/she is fighting for.  You really enjoy playing and the story comes together quite nicely with the different stories that are intersecting.

In the end the game is fun and you will enjoy playing it.  The mechanics of the gameplay are really good and you will enjoy the variations of assassinations and the different fighting mechanics.  The fighting when dealing with multiple people could be better for switching between assailants, but other than that it is smooth and fun.",positive
2575,"The gamepad is extremely precise when compared to the ""stock"" 360 wireless controller. The input lag is reduced to near zero allowing you to target and track enemies better. This I would assume is due to the controller being wired.

The programmable buttons are a nice feature. I have the right one programmed to the back button in order to ""spot"" enemies in BF3 without having to remove my thumb from the sticks. I have yet to find a good use for the left one. I've tried reload, run, etc. None really make a big difference, but it's nice to have the option.

I have a couple complaints, but not deal breakers by any means. The button clicks which most people seem to like, annoy me. They're just too loud. I would prefer a quieter and smoother button press. The directional pad though nice that it is ""digital"" rather than ""analog"" (best way I can describe it), reduces mistakes but can be difficult to depress at times.

Overall it's a great controller. The best aftermarket one I've used. A must for any XBOX 360 gamer.",positive

2577,"Ok. The Splatoon bundle is a best buy exclusive, so if you buy it here you'll pay a mark up. That's not the point of a review though.

I enjoy the system a lot and have bought several games.  I really don't like that the included game is a digital download, I like having a game to have on my shelf. But with the price, the game is pretty much free, and since at the time of this review, the game is still full price, the bundle is actually a pretty good deal.

Splatoon is a very innovative and fun game. I like it a lot.

The Wii u console seems to have been a worthwhile purchase. I recommend to others.

2579,"THUG 2 Came out last year and was a pretty popular game. What I liked about the game is how they included older levels with updated graphics.

You can play online, too, which is a lot of fun and I think it adds to the excellence of this game more so.

Main aspects of the game such as visuals, level design, story, and weaspons have all been improved over R2 but only slightly in some areas. One thing I like the most is the weapons; they feel a lot more powerful than before and there are a few additions are gives you more variety. Enemy AI and variety has also been improved over past releases; no more hopping back and forth! The ending was a big surprise and worth the trip.

2585,"For those of you complaining about Steam give me a break I have had no issues with them wish I could say the same for COD 4 and the Punk Buster crap. Next the computer gaming world is dying a slow death and has been since Microsoft decided to only release Halo 2 on Xbox it sent a clear sign of things to come. Of course this game was made for the likes of PS3 and Xbox 360 more people own them then people with computers able to run this game in the manner it needs to be. Don't complain when it jumps or jerks when your running it on a machine made in 2000 with a 64 mb graphic card! For me I loved it and it held up to the first one, its tough to best the first title but I think they tied so thats pretty darn good in my eyes. The story fits with the first and it adds upon it and for those of us who have completed the game it leaves you hanging like the first. Cant wait for FEAR 3 hopefully on the PC but like I said it seems less likely every day. Don't think so? just look at all the card games Amazon has compaired to FPS or role playing. Sad indeed",neutral
2586,"I've been a Nintendo fan for years. Generation after generation they put out amazing consoles with excellent games. So it comes as no suprise that the Wii continues the tradition started back in 1985.

The Wii was codenamed the Revolution becasue it was supposed to revolutionize the way we play games. I'm not so convinced that it accomplished it's goal per se, but I do think that it did introduce some new ways to play. When I first heard about the system I didn't think it would be nearly as successful as it was. I thought odd name, last gen graphics, and strange (ablbiet interesting) controller, yeah, good luck with that Nintendo. I was convinced that it would turn out much like the GCN, reasonably successful but nowhere near it's competition.

Well here we are 5 years later and we all know how it turned out. Much to everyones suprise, the Wii turned out to be a tremendous success. People were calling it the Gamecube 2 because it didn't have HD graphics. While the Wii may be similar to the Gamecube (GCN) in terms of archecture, in nearly every other aspect it is a completely different system. It was given marketed as family centered, rather than specifically to the gamer, where the GCN was fairly powerful for its day the Wii was quite underpowered, and the GCN had a focus on contectivity (GB link cable, GB player, Limited LAN support) the wii focused on motion controls.

The motion controls are the heart and soul of the Wii. While the PS3 and Xbox 360 have their respective options for motion controled gaming, it is hard to argue that the Wii not only started this ""revolution"" but they also have the largest library of motion controled games. So it goes without saying that if you want motion controlled gaming, the wii is not only the best option, it also happens to be the most affordable.

The purpose of this review is not to compare the Wii to it's competitors, it truly is a stand alone system, and is not fair to do so.

In my opinion, the Wii will largely appeal to two large contrasting groups: non gamers and core gamers.

On one hand you have the non gamers, they will immediatley be attracted to games like Wii sports, Wii fit, Kriby's Epic Yarn, Just Dance, Lego Star Wars, and things of that nature. These are games that anyone can pick up and play and have very broad appeal. The reason for the Wii's success is the non gamer, Nintendo captured an audience that no one knew even existed. Games like these are the reason that you will see the Wii in nursing homes and hospitals.

On the other had you have the hardcore or core gamer. Games like Metroid Prime 3, Donkey Kong Courty Returns, No More Heros, Red Steel 2, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Mad World are games that appeal to them. Many of these are hidden gems that only the core know or care about they are every bit as good as the better known Wii titles.

Peronally I am somewhat of a rare breed in the fact that I enjoy both, but most gamers will fall under one catagory or another. I think the real diffrenece between the two is the casual gamer will purchase the Wii as a an only system, whereas the core gamer will buy it to go along with a straight hardcore system. But it's that broad appeal that makes the Wii as successful has it has been.

Unfortunatley, the Wii's best years are behind it. 2010 may have been a great year for the system, but 2011, thus far has been very weak. With E3 coming around the corner gamers will see what will be the last major software to be released for the system, and of course it's successor with be there as well. But not all is bleak, Nintendo just recently dropped the price of the Wii to $149 and swapped out Wii sports and Wii sports resort for Mario Kart Wii. Furthermore they rolled out their Player's choice lineup albeit under a different name. As they say, good things come to those who wait. Now is a great time to buy because the better price, better software bundled, and there is a fairly large library of games avalable.

The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because I do feel it is missing in some key areas that make it hard to give a perfect score. First, I do feel the online aspect of the Wii is very weak. The setup makes it near impossible to find friends online and communicate with them. Very few games sopport voice chat.

Second, because of the popularity of the system there is a TON of shovelware. Shovelware is (as the name imples) garbage software that gets shoveled onto the system so the developers can make a quick buck off the popularity of the Wii. Generally, I would say stick to first party titles if you want to be safe but even some of these aren't worth getting. Games like Wii music are terrible. Do your reseach and you wii be fine. Finally, even though the library is impressive, there are some holes in there. You will be hard pressed to find ambitions RPG's or M rated action games. Don't get me wrong, they do exist, but few and far between.

Overall the Wii is a wonderful system with a lot to offer. The new bundle is excellent and Mario Kart is a game with universal appeal. The price is appealing, for $150 you can't go wrong. Unless you're holding out for Wii U, I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a balanced system with a good library.",positive
2587,Pokemon Emerald another additon to the Pokemon franchise. This game is quite similar to Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. Pokemon are the same but there are a few new add ins like the Battle Tower I belive. Personally I was unable to play this game through yet due to I barely made it through Ruby. If you have played neither Ruby nor Sapphire I recommend you buy this game because it contains bits of Ruby and Sapphire and more.,neutral
2588,"so this game has very few checkpoints and you cant save the game, you must complete the level in order to save it. SO, who cares. the outstanding graphics and sound makes up for most, especially the gameplay. I shoot and reload sometimes just to hear the amazing sound effects, very realistic. This is probibly equal to COD2(call of duty 2) both fun and exciting. Also in COD2 if you haven't noticed, you don't get to save your gameplay you must beat the level, and there are only a few more checkpoints then in BLACK. so there of equal matters. this game is loads of fun.

for the previous reviewer, there are plenty of weapons- you just have to find them :}

2589,"Sure, 8GB of storage might not be worth it, but I already have a 1TB hard drive that I plan to use with it. Plus, I can play Wii games on it.

Pros:
Internal storage is expandable via USB Flash Drives and/or USB Hard Drives up to 2TB
Backwards compatible with Wii accessories and most Wii games

Cons:
Wii U Gamepad battery only lasts 3-5 hours on a single charge (needs much longer battery life, also need more Wii U Gamepads)
Price tag is way too much for both Basic and Deluxe sets (cut down on the prices, Nintendo. Dang!)
No WiiConnect24 in Wii Mode.

Overall: I think this is pretty good, but if I were you, I'd wait until AFTER Nintendo slashes the price tag on both sets, unless you can't wait to get it.

Update: It's not as slow now, thanks to the recent system software update, which include a lot of improvements, such as alternately booting into the Wii Menu by pressing and holding the B button on the Wii U Gamepad while the Wii U logo is displayed while booting up, afterwards saying ""Going to Wii Menu.""",neutral

2593,"There is no doubt about the fact that music games have been dominating the video game industry lately. With the success of seeing Guitar Hero and Rock Band bring new ways we play our favorite systems like the Playstation 3 and with the recent attempt of bringing Rock Band to the Nintendo Wii, gamers are eagerly ambitious on jamming to their favorite songs and being Rock Gods. But, with the handheld systems like the Nintendo DS and PSP, gamers have been left out of the cold, on jamming to their favorite songs on the go. Now, that is about to change graciously for Nintendo DS fans young and old, who can now say, we are just like our Rock Gods.

Guitar Hero: On Tour is the first handheld edition of Activision's great Rock game, this time it is on the Nintendo DS. The DS game is the most expensive handheld of the DS history. The game, includes a very special controller which allows you to jam to 20 classic Rock & Roll tracks, that range from guilty pleasures, all the way to Rock Classics. The song list includes songs that have mostly been featured from previous Guitar Hero games, as well as Rock Band as too. The track list come includes classic songs like Kiss's Rock and Roll All Night, Jet's Are You Gonna Be My Girl, and the Gwen Stefani hit when she was a part of No Doubt with Spiderwebs, to party songs like Smash Mouth's All Star and Blink 182's All The Small Things. The collection doesn't stand out to seperate itself, from the other music games, but brings in a good introduction to the classic Rock songs to the DS.

The control also works very well, by bringing in a new element of gameplay, by adding a guitar add-on controller that connects into the Game Boy Advance slot of the DS. The control is a bit different to master, but is easy to get used to. You can play with different modes like VS. mode, by going head-to head with others. You can also battle in on tour mode, which allows you to play your way to the top. The game takes full advantage of the DS as well by allowing you to use your microphone to yell out Rock On, to activate your Star Power, and to put out your guitar from burning flames. Also you have to strum your way using a very special guitar-shaped stylus that looks like a guitar pick that helps take full advantage of the DS gameplay. The new modes also work well including a new dueling Guitar Mode, which allows you and annother gamer to jam into a duet to your favorite tracks.

While all the excitement has been more about the fact that Guitar Hero: On Tour is the game itself, there are a couple of disadvantages to the game, that doesn't amke it completely stand away from the home consoles that've made Guitar Hero stand out. The first is that that there is a lack of online gaming. Here, unfortunately you cannot compete agaiunst any wannabe Rock Gods online, as we've seen well with the Nintendo Wii on Guitar Hero III, which lacks in gameplay, also is that the game also suffers from downloading music from the internet that matches it from the home console counterparts. The second problem is that the game also lacks a creative mode where you can design your players in any way or form you choose.

Still, with all of the disadvantages, Guitar Hero: On Tour still works as a unique and well-rendered introduction to the Nintendo DS that is great for anyone who is a hard core fan of playing the guitar, or anyone who wants to be a rock legend. While the hype has been much more around, Rock Band for the Wii and the upcoming Guitar Hero: Aerosmith edition, this still works well as a great challenge that redefines what we've seen in music games for the home consoles, and bring in a new way to jam to your favorites that makes it better than playing an Air Guitar anyday of the week.

2595,"After countless spin offs the real deal is here: Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.  The Pokemon craze has been around for years.  Ever since the Red and Blue versions hit way back, Pokemon has been huge.  It's tried and true formula has worked for over ten years, and it's pretty apparent that the formula isn't going to die now.  Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are a lot like the Pokemon games that preceded it, but they've really thrown in some good touches here.  Still, most players who've been playing since the Gameboy days, or even as recent as the GBA days will still get a ""been there, done that,"" feeling.  Still, the game is good, addictive and it will keep you busy for hours on end.

As I said, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl have a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel.  You begin as a rookie trainer in a village, and under some circumstances, you are asked by a professor to go and collect Pokemon data  using a Pokedex.  On your journey your goal is to collect as many Pokemon as you can and train them to take on other trainers, and to get all the badges from the games various gym leaders, while you've got a rival who is out doing to same thing to prove he's better than you.  In addition, there's an evil organization called Team Galactic that has plans for a new world order and to do that they need all the Pokemon they can get.  If all this sounds familiar, that's because it is!  It's the exact same formula that worked for the original Pokemon games on the Gameboy, the games on the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance.  The story, of course, is simple and charming, but where Pokemon has always managed to shine most is it's fantastic and addictive gameplay.

Pokemon is actually really strategic and in-depth.  That is to say, it requires a lot of thought, and believe me, some of these battles (especially against the new Pokemon that are introduced in this version) require a lot of your skill.  Battles are turn based, where you select a command and then watch a round of combat.  There's a paper/rock/scissors effect here, however.  Each and every Pokemon has a type, and some of the attacks they use reflect its type.  This makes up what deals massive damage, what deals no damage and what deals just normal damage.  Grass may be strong against water, for example but grass is also weak against fire, but in turn, fire is weak versus water.  This effect plays through with seventeen and different types, and there is no best type because every type has a weakness.  It's because of this element that Pokemon is so much fun to play.  Just trying to construct the perfect team will take you more than a day, and with over 100 new creatures to collect, you can form endless amounts of teams.  Just catching all the Pokemon alone will keep you busy for well over 50 hours.  To add to the effect you'll face several other trainers as well, and you never know what they'll throw at you.  Your strongest Pokemon may very well become your weakest in certain battles just because of its type.

The battle system itself is made even simplar by the touch screen.  Where as before you were scrolling through menus, battling can simply be done by touching the different options on screen.  It makes battling a lot faster, especially because the icons are pretty big.  Luckily, there's never really a point where you have to use the touch screen if you don't want to, and battling can still be done the old fashioned way if you so choose.

As with Ruby and Sapphire there are also moments of two on two battles.  Usually they come with either two trainers taking you on at a time, and you'll send out the two Pokemon in your top roster, or you'll be with another trainer who will send out his or her Pokemon with yours.  It adds to the strategic feel of the game, but the moments of two on two battles are pretty few and far between.

In your journey you'll also receive a nifty watch that works based off the time of your internal clock.  This means that much like Gold and Silver, it'll switch between day and night.  Some Pokemon come out only in the early morning, others come out late at night.  Some Pokemon only come out on certain days.  Either way, those itching to catch each and every Pokemon will enjoy this aspect of it.

As I said before, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl have added some new things.  The most important new thing however, is how much easier it is to trade Pokemon and battle with your friends.  Using Wi-fi on the DS is far better than the various link cables or having to go out and buy the wireless adapter for the GBA.  You can battle with people all across the world, and do other things as well, such as trade with them.  Of course, in order to enjoy the full benefits of this you'll need the friend code to do it, and sometimes.  In order to get the full experience of the online gaming world in Pokemon, you'll need to register friend codes.  If you don't you can't enjoy some of the better perks, like being able to talk to a friend using the microphone of your DS as you battle.  Still, the combat is enhanced greatly when playing online.  If you don't want to play online you can easily connect to another DS and battle it out that way with your friend simply sitting in the room.

Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are also full of little secret goodies.  There are the legendary Pokemon, Pokemon contests, and of course, even after you've finished the main story there's more to be done.  You can transfer Pokemon from your GBA versions by sticking it into the GBA slot of the DS.  No matter how you slice it, Pokemon can easily keep you busy longer than several RPGs combined

I wish I could say the graphics and sound are absolutely amazing, but they're really not.  For as much fun as this game is, it's certainly not the best as far as graphics go.  The same goes for the sound as well.  Pokemon has never really been a game you go after for eye-candy, though.  There are some moments where some 3D effects come out, but not very many.  The sprites are more or less the same sprites they've been using since the Red and Blue versions.  Ideally, the game doesn't look all that much of a step up from Ruby and Sapphire, and they were not fantastic looking games either.  It's really colorful, but the DS is capable of so much more than this.  Likewise, in battle is still as horrible as ever.  Fun to do it, but the Pokemon still only flinch to attack, and there aren't a lot of animations going on, and we're still looking over the Pokemon's shoulder.  Essentially, the combat engine hasn't changed since the series first outing in 1998.  There are some move animations that look really good, but aside from that it's hard to look passed the simple fact that the game's combat engine hasn't really evolved since the original games came out way back in 1998.  This isn't the original Gameboy, this is the Nintendo DS.

The sound is also no exception.  A lot of it sounds really tinny.  There are some tunes that definitely sound Pokemon like, but again, it's using old technology on a system capable of a lot more.  Most of the sound effects such as the Pokemon's cries are ripped straight from--you guessed it--the original Gameboy versions released in 1998.  That's not to say all the tunes sound bad, it's just to say that a lot of what you're going to hear is recycled.

Despite the games graphics and sound, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are still excellent games.  There's a lot more depth here than people think, and a lot of stuff to keep you busy for a long time to come.  Even those who are tired of the same simplistic plot and formula will find something great here.

Pros:

+Simple, yet addictive gameplay

+Deep, strategic combat system

+Touch screen controls make battling easier

+Wi-fi connection works well

+Over 100 new Pokemon join the roster

+Simple storyline that anyone can understand

+Being able to battle trainers all across the globe and being able to trade with them is fantastic

+Game can keep you busy for hours with all there is to do, easily over 80 hours worth of gameplay

Cons:

-You can still only save one file

-Graphics and sound are horribly outdated

-The formula works, but there are bound to be gamers out there who are sick of the same old storyline",positive
2596,"This first person perspective shooter is an interesting mix of history and science fiction.  There is no printed manual. (one is included on the disc)  The game installs easily, no online connection is needed.  It is not a long game.  It took me about 25 hours to play through but better players could probably do it in  considerably less time.  It was very stable.  I experienced no freezes and only one crash.  The game contains a large amount of f-words.  (would have been better without the language)

Most of the game is played in two time periods:  the American War Between the States or the First World War.  The game is linear as you must play a series of missions.  You usually have a choice of which time period to go to but in the end you would have to complete them all so it doesn't really matter if you switch back and forth or not.  The battlefields are fairly large.  It isn't like so many games where you are confined to a narrow path.  Most of the fighting takes place on open fields or wooded areas.  There are some interesing twists to the game.

Controls are typical for such a game.  You can run, jump, crouch, shoot from the hip or aim down the barrel.  Checkpoint saves are used but they are very numerous.  There was only one place where I thought they missed one and I had to repeat a section about 20 times to get through it.

The time travel element to the story made it a unique game in my experience.  If you like history but not science fiction you won't like it.  (and vice versa)  It was actually more fun using the period weapons than the times it let you use modern weapons in the older time period. (no one seemed to notice when you did so)  I agree with other reviewers that it would have been a good game without the time travel story.  Call it Riflemen Through Time and add another one or two campaigns in different time periods.  How about the Zulu wars, Boer war, the British Raj, Napoleonic Wars (think Richard Sharpe), Spanish American War, American Revolutionary War, etc.?  There are so many areas that haven't been touched by the game designers.  I think playing with the old single shot rifles is as much fun as using the newer weaponry.",positive

Pros and Cons

(+) Pros:
- Excellent quality game, great graphics and sound effects.
- Solid storyline for the most part, despite some very cheesy moments and dialogue.
- Game runs well on almost any half decent machine.
- Smooth gameplay.
- Very addictive multiplayer.
- Game is more forgiving to newcomers when compared to Starcraft 1 or Warcraft 3. Different level leagues help players match up against people their skill level.

(-) Cons:
- Game is easier for newcomers, but it's still a highly competitive game. Don't expect to be in the master or diamond leagues if you're new to the game any time soon.
- Only Terran campaign available, obviously they want you to buy the next 2 games ($$$$).
- No LAN support.
- Bnet has its problems, interface is laggy at times and not always easy to use.
- Multiplayer games can get very repetitive because most people use cookie cutter strategies.
- Gameplay is VERY similar to Starcraft I, very few changes.

Summary: Don't believe the haters, Starcraft 2 is a fantastic game, BUT, it's not as groundbreaking as Starcraft 1. When Starcraft 1 was first released, a lot of its features were brand new and very appealing. Starcraft 2 is very well refined but little has changed fundamentally.

You don't have much freedom at higher levels of ladder/league play. You usually have to stick to the main 2-3 cookie cutter strategies or risk getting completely trampled because the game is very specifically balanced. This is great for E-sports, but bad for the general fanbase due to the lack of freedom. Expect multiplayer games to get very repetitive after some time. Playing with friends, custom games, and different leagues help make up for this to a certain extent.

The game will probably live on as an E-sport for quite some time (which is what blizzard wanted). The game should keep you hooked long enough until the expansions come out which should be good, knowing Blizzard's history.

I respect Blizzard for doing the game well, but they played it TOO SAFE. A few new features would've gone a long way.

Rating: 9/10. A must have if you're into RTS, but don't expect a game as earth shattering as the first, rather expect a very well refined and technically proficient game.",positive
2602,"It's Neptunia. Of course it's awesome. haha

That being said, this def. a step back from Re;Birth1. Mainly because the focus shifts from Neptune to Nepgear who is not nearly as interesting as a main character (the same problem mk2 had).
This game also tends to be preachy with it's anti-piracy message. Every game in the series has a personfied character representing piracy but it's usually done in a toung and cheek way. In Re;Birth 2 it doesnt feel even trying to make a joke when it deals with the topic of piracy.
Also, the battle system is the exact same system used in Victory and Re;Birth1. While it is a great system, perhaps it's time to retire it.
Lastly, where the series started out parodying and making fun of otaku and weeboo culture, I've noticed, with the last few releases, the series tends to be embracing those subcultures and, to put it bluntly, those subcultures are weird (they're cartoons. not your ******* ""waifu"".)
Apparently Black Heart and Action Unleashed just further embrace this trend. As long as they are funny as hell, I can tolerate it, I suppose.

The game is still a great. The battle system is fun. The story and characters, while not as great as Re;Birth1, are still fun. Bringing RED back (who hadnt been in a game since she was a DLC character for the original) was def. welcome.
Personified Game Consoles and Handhelds fight each other and unite to fight off piracy in the most satirical and sillyest way possible. That's pretty much Neptunia in a nutshell. Even though the tone of this rambling was mostly negative, it's because I'm comparing it to it's predessessor which is, by far, the best game in the Neptunia series. Be;Birth2 is to Re;Birth1 what DA2 is to DA: Origins. It's a great game in it's own right it just had some big shoes to fill.
It may not fill those shoes but it's still a very fun, light hearted JRPG with a very good battle system. Fans of Neptunia will buy it regardless. People who are unsure should probably start with Victory or Re;Birth1 as they capture the spirit of what the series is the best.",negative

This game is a lot of fun.  Especially at parties.  I would recommend having this game set up for a teenage party.  It is a blast to play, and everyone can get into it, whether you are playing, or just watching.

Sometimes the controller does not work perfectly, but should work well for most average sized gamers.  Short kids, around 4 foot and shorter, might have a little trouble.  But there is a gauge you set up, which helps you to play better.  Also, expect a lot of errors by the system.  This is normal, but gets irritating.

Enjoy!

A Great, and the only, city simulation game for the computer. This latest installment boasts the best graphics and special effects in the series, as well as more detail in the area of micromanagement.
The Good:
Graphics, sound, music, dynamic visualizations, disasters
The Bad:
Awful terrain editing machine, railroads do not operate properly, streets and railroad tracks cannot bridge over each other or cross at odd angles on the city grid (although this problem should be corrected in Rush Hour), seaports and rail connections are a pain to get working properly, city areas are much smaller than in previous versions.

  WOW! This game was well-thought out.

2609,"More games have been releasing with a focus on narrative of late, and I consider that to be a good thing. Click and point adventure titles have been making something of a comeback, and even games referred to as walking simulators are more about the story than the gameplay mechanics. It would be easy to call The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a walking simulator, but that would be selling the title short. There is plenty to see, but enough to do to justify thinking of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as a complete game worth experiencing.

The titular Ethan Carter is a kid who has sent letters to our actual protagonist, Paul Prospero. There is a bit of backstory given as Paul emerges from a dark tunnel to find himself standing in a beautiful wooded area. The backdrop is simple enough, yet incredibly vague as it sets the table for this mystery. Ethan has been sending mail to Paul, a detective with psychic abilities. At first Ethan's letters come across as typical fare - fan mail essentially. However, as the young boy continues to share what he sees and knows with Paul, it becomes clear to the detective that Ethan is at the center of something sinister in Red Creek Valley, a little wooded nook of the world that time has forgotten.

The backdrop for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is wonderfully crafted to set the stage for a mystery filled with murder and partial clues. The reason this title will no doubt earn the walking simulator description is because there is no actual combat or life-threatening challenges to overcome with Paul. Instead, you will guide Paul through a first person perspective through beautiful forests, across aging bridges, down abandoned railroad tracks and into dilapidated old buildings.

The environments in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter are often spectacular. The sky is brushes of painted colors, the trees rustle and move with a subtle life while abandoned buildings have different levels of light filtering through boarded up windows to create a visual atmosphere that is as good as anything I have ever seen. It is spectacularly, hauntingly beautiful and it is very easy to spend a good chunk of your time simply taking the sights in.

As for the actual gameplay mechanics, the idea is that you will lead Paul around the environment taking things in. Right off of the bat you may encounter some traps set in the woods. What Paul does is encounter key items in the environment, and by piecing them together, he starts to solve the riddle to Ethan Carter's disappearance. These items are not easy to spot, because The Vanishing of Ethan Carter does not hold your hand at all. Items in the environment blend easily, with no outlines or distinguishing features. You have to actually look at the world around Paul, to see that there is something a bit odd in the brush ahead or to notice that the pile of rocks near the end of the tracks looks out of place.

Once you get suitably close to these objects, you might get some text that encourages you to read or interact with the object, and then you can work with it, but it is very easy to miss these things when you first play the game. Of course, the very hide and seek nature of this game design means that subsequent replays will probably be much quicker affairs that lose a significant amount of their luster. Exploration and discovery are at the heart of this title, and the mechanics work great - but they do lack in replay value.

Sometimes the finding of clues is simply a matter of stumbling onto them and reading them. At other times you will be tasked to find items to help solve fairly simple environmental puzzles. In other instances you will be asked to find multiple sets of clues. Each new clue Paul finds will allow him to 'see' more of what happened through his supernatural gift - until the entire scene plays out. One scene somewhat early on has you reconstructing the crime. The step-by-step assembly process actually reminded me of a similar scene in Arkham Knight about a third of the way through the main storyline. In both instances it really felt like I was a detective trying to put things together, and this game deserves credit for managing things so well.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a well written supernatural mystery with gorgeous environments and simple but fitting music that help to sell the immersive experience. There are enough gameplay mechanics to help elevate the title beyond just a walking game, despite the actual threat of death and combat. The end result is a memorable story worth the five or so hours you will spend playing through to the end.",positive

Its no ""force unleashed"" but it is what it is, lots of characters can be played from Luke, to Vader, to Han, to Chewbacca, to a Tuskin Raider lookin' thing named ""Hoar"".

2614,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of post-apocalyptic style games.  But, I picked this game up on some friends' recommendations and to be honest, I enjoyed it.

Pros
- You can customize almost every aspect of your character: armor, statistics, perks, etc
- Free-roaming game where you can go anywhere and pursue any quest you want whenever you want (or no quest at all if you just want to explore)
- The extra/included DLC content was a lot of fun and in some cases it even included some powerful upgrades for your character

Cons
- Very dark: there are a lot of places in this game where it is VERY hard to see what's going on.  Supposedly your Pip-Boy 3000 has a built-in flashlight, but I wasn't able to find it or figure out how to turn it on
- Plot was okay...but not great
- There wasn't a whole lot of attachment to the characters...no buy-in factor on the emotional level (i.e. if someone dies, it doesn't really effect you at all)
- There is a LOT of back and forth walking around, even when you fast-travel from place to place

All-in-all, I don't regret buying the game as it has provided at least 45 hours of entertainment (and I don't even have 1/2 of the achievements, yet), but I still prefer the Mass Effect series.",positive
2615,"I bought this game initially because I have played several of the previous Assassins Creed games and generally enjoyed them.

What I didn't expect was to have so much fun being a pirate. There is still the same old land based combat available where you clear maps and run missions and assassinations but the new content on the ship is what I have enjoyed most. There are forts to conquer and lots of different ships to sink (or capture) and it has been great so far.  I imagine that the ship combat will eventually get tiresome but I think the ship combat adds some much needed life to this old series.

Overall the game is good, the land map clearing is the same old stuff from previous titles in this series but the ships are what have made me excited to play this game.",positive
2616,"I was a late comer to this Quake-2 engined FPS game.  One or two of my clan buddies and some other online gamers I knew were heavily into the whole Team Fortress scene via their purchase of Half Life.  PC Gamer had rated this exceptionally high, and most of the gaming sites I surfed all mentioned Half Life in some form or another.

The game had actually come bundled with my video card at the time for my computer.  I shrugged at it because I had so many other games and other activities at the time.  It wouldn't be until over a year later or so that I would finally crack open the disks and install the thing.

Wow, it really opened my eyes to another realm of sci-fi shooters.  I wasn't hugely impressed like all folks who raved about the game, because it was based on the Quake-2 engine.  Now why was that a bad thing?  Because Quake-2 relied on a sector loading model to cut down on huge maps eating up RAM and HD space on relatively primitive computers of the time.  The primary reason was the higher polygon count and textures with a slightly larger color palette.  It made for a richer gaming experience, but ate up memory and storage space.

Solution; create sections of maps, and marry them.  Ergo you leave one area of a map to connect with another.  It made for a slightly strange gaming experience, but then got somewhat annoying, all the way down to irritating.  I mean games like SHOGO, Thief and Jedi Knight were out at the time, and didn't require the same kind of engine design, AND those games had larger maps, richer textures that made up for models that didn't have the same kind of detail.

But, for all that, Half Life did entertain.  Set in the midwest Badlands of the USA, this particular science fiction game harkens back a classic 1950's/1960's science fiction formula, only updated for a 90s audience.  Science has gone wrong, and it is up to you to mitigate the disaster, and overcome obstacles meant to contain said disaster.  There are some aspects that get somewhat repetitive, and when you combine that with the map structure that I mentioned, it gets a little irritating that you can't escape to another portion of a larger map (as you could on other games) to deal with a threat, challenge or puzzle.  Still, the story and setting were compelling enough that I stuck with it, and played through the entire game.

I experienced head crabs, zombies, creatures from another world, special forces trying to contain the threat, apache helos trying to kill me, and various puzzles and challenges.  It was a lot of fun for a game that had limitations.  But, the thing that really helped were all the addons that could be downloaded from the net and applied to the basic story.  Titles like ""Redemption"" or ""Azure Sheep"" to name but a couple, did much to prolongate the appeal of a game that, by the time I got around to playing it, had shown its age.

In fact, I still play this game to this very day.  With the plethora of user made addons it's hard to see this game vanishing entirely any time soon.  It's fairly primitive by a lot of contemporary standards, but still has a lot of value going for it.

Veterans, you already love this.

2617,"I like a good strategy game and leave it to the people behind Civilization to create a strategy game that feels like it was made for a console. The game was instantly addictive and there were a ton of things to do. Turn based combat, building your underground base, training troops, research, creating weapons and armor and more. So good. My only complaint is the difficulty. It started out great and had a good curve to it, the game proceeded to get gradually more challenging and then all of a sudden it just shifted into becoming exceedingly difficult. Took a bit of restructuring to get going again. But still, a truly great game.",neutral
2618,"Who could forget Punch-Out for the NES?  I know I can't, playing as Little Mac and getting my butt handed to me by Mike Tyson over and over again.  Well, let's fast-forward to 2009 now, and Nintendo has brought Punch-Out back for the Wii, minus Mike Tyson of course, and the kind of oh so fun gameplay that made the original game so good is wonderfully re-created here with this new Punch-Out.  The themes of the original game are re-vitalized, with the same presentation of the original Punch-Out re-created with some modern 3-D elements that end up making the game look surprisingly great in the graphics department, and the fluid animation only adds to the visual experience.  Gameplay wise, the formula remains the same, as Punch-Out requires having quick reflexes and recognizing your opponent's fighting patterns is the big key to success.  Once you manage to grasp those elements, the game becomes a blast to play through.  The lack of online however is a gaping hole, but there's enough replayability here with the main three circuits, facing tougher versions of previous fighters, and of course, VS mode.  All in all, the new Punch-Out for the Wii is a blast to play, and fans of the original should definitely pick this up.",neutral

2624,"When Resident Evil first debuted in 1996, it was an instant classic.  This is THE game that is responsible for the genre, ""Survival Horror"" and ten years later, you can play it on the go with your Nintendo DS.

The story is almost known to everyone in the gaming world nowadays, but let's take a recap.  The STARS Bravo Team has disappeared while investigating nasty murders in the mountains near an old mansion.  The Alpha team has been sent into these mountains to find their comrades, and are immediately chased into this mansion full of horror.  As Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, you'll have to survive the mansion and its terrors and unravel a conspiracy beyond belief.

Almost everyone knows the story, and on the Nintendo DS you'll find you can play through it in classic mode, rebirth mode or Wi-Fi mode.  Capcom has been known for giving you different scenarios, and Resident Evil shows that perfectly.  At the beginning you can choose to either be Chris or Jill.  Chris can take more damage, although Jill has an easier time navigating the mansion, and gets some fairly more powerful weapons early on.

Classic Mode is basically the exact same game that was presented to us in 1996.  Most--if not all--the regular enemies are still where they once were, all the secrets are unchanged and everything.  If you still remember the game from ten years ago, it hasn't changed.  Not at all.

Rebirth Mode is worthwhile, though.  Upon playing it, there are more enemies in place, and from time to time when you enter a room you'll be in the first person perspective, fighting against an enemy that is creeping toward you.  It is your job to use the stylus to slash at your enemy until he dies.  At first this seems stupid, but it's actually really fun and intense.

The map is displayed on screen at all times, so unlike before, you don't constantly have to bring up the map.  When you take damage the top screen also flashes, which is actually more of a distraction than anything.

Wi-fi mode, while great to have, really isn't as worthwhile as you might think.  Everyone needs the game card.  You can have up to four players going through a portion of the mansion.  Whether you are cooperating or competing the objective is the same, to get to the goal as fast as you can.  In cooperating, you both have the same life gauge and you both go at it on your own.  In competative, you're both against one another trying to see who can get there the fastest.

However, the problem is that you don't ever get to actually see your partner.  You're both going through these portions of the mansion but you won't run into one another, and that takes the joy out of it, really.  So wi-fi really isn't worth it.

I must say, though, it's fun to play through classic and rebirth mode to check out the differences.  While it is just a port, the differences aren't just small things you won't notice at all.

The controls are still a bit clunky.  Yes, up is still going to be the button to move forward at all times.  And if you're used to Resident Evil 4, it may be hard to go back to those fixed camera angles.  So even veterans of the series may have to readjust.

The graphics aren't bad, but they are, for the most part, dated.  They don't quite live up to the DS's potential, but they do look a little neater than they did on the PSX.  The music is hair-raising, and is still your only warning sign of danger.  Especially the sound effects of shuffling zombies, dogs clicking on the ground.  This stuff sounds even better with the DS's stereo sound.  The voice acting is still laughable, and I suppose that's actually amusing.  The dialogue is so bad that it's classic.  You'll be saying to yourself, ""Wow, we've come a long way as far as voice acting and scripts are concerned.""  Again, if you just got off Resident Evil 4, this could be something that takes a moment to get used to.  Still, the fact that you can laugh at the voices shows that the game really is a classic, as voice acting really has come a long way.

The major problems with this game are simple.  It's a game that's already been redone.  The Director's Cut and Gamecube versions.  Also, it's a game where its age really does show.  Can Resident Evil survive the test of time?  The answer is, yes, it can.  But unfortunately, a port might not hold true.  In fact, if you've still got the original one (or the Director's Cut) it's hard to actually recommend this title to you.  Rebirth Mode is great, and it's also fun to have it on the go, but there just isn't enough new content to it.  It's a great game, and after ten years it's still a blast to play.  But for Resident Evil's ten year anniversary, I was expecting more extras and secrets.  Still, I'd say it is worth it.  Pick it up, enjoy it, and relive the classic game that invented a genre.

The Good

+Classic Game

+Classic Story

+Interesting Puzzles

+The map is now displayed on the top screen

+New Touch Screen antics are really nice

+Graphics are smoother

+The Music is still really good

+You just have to admit that after ten years, the game is still pretty damn good!

The Bad

-The voice acting is terrible.  Although, I like that you can see just how far games have come, you'll find yourself laughing in spite of the games overall serious tone.

2629,"I have been a fan of the Metal Gear Solid series since it's debut on the original PlayStation in 1998. I think Kojima is 100% a genius and one of the greatest video game designers of all time, right up there with Shigeru Miyamoto. One of the things that have been the heart and soul of the MGS games since the original is Kojima's philosophy and his storytelling.

When you play each game you get a feel for the characters and their backstory, and how often times there is an association with a deeper tragedy in their past that has afflicted them. On top of this you have the always era-relevant political standpoints of each game (usually revolving around nuclear warfare) that are entwined throughout these characters and stories.

All of these things are what make a Metal Gear Solid game to me. So many people complained about MGS4 because of how many cutscenes there are and how long they were, but to this day that is what makes that game one of the absolute best Metal Gear games that will ever be made. Unfortunately between Kojima's infatuation with open-world (which I have no problem with) and listening to 'fan' complaints about cutscenes, we were left with something too episodic and more unfulfilled.

There is obviously a way to make an open world game that still has an epic overall story (GTA V). It felt too uncharacteristic to have to play each story mission with the same intro and outro using opening and closing credits every single time. Sometimes I didn't even know what I was playing. Too many of the missions were to simply extract or assassinate someone. This is not normally how MGS games are. Being taken through a linear story with each objective being relevant to the mission is what I am used to.

In the end, as the title says, the gameplay is astounding (best of the series), the graphics are drool-worthy (best of the series), but the story is underwhelming. I like that you can change outfits and customize weapons but I don't care so much for the mother base aspect of it. Being able to have 'buddies' can be fun sometimes (definitely helpful), but too UNLIKE previous games. ""Remember Snake this is a sneaking mission"", is something you often heard before going on missions in the previous games. Now not only is it not necessarily a solo mission (unless you choose) but it doesn't really have to be a sneaking mission either.

Still a decent game, but too many changes shifted the focus of how the franchise began to something really more action oriented.",positive
2630,"The platforming can certainly get annoying at times but overall, Donkey Kong Country is one of those classic games that you simply must play if you call yourself a gamer.",positive
2631,"Let me add my voice to the many others that have sung the praises of this game. Bloody, button mashing fun. And it comes with the originals! If you like God of War-style combat and vulgarity and gore, this game is for you.

I think God of War is the model, because it plays very similar to that stellar series, right down to the bonus levels where you just take on wave after wave of enemies.

But there is a lot to do -- the main game is pretty long, plus has collectibles (including nude photos of your girlfriend, which is gratuitous, but that's the spirit of the game). And it includes the first three games and unlockables. That's what makes it worth a purchase in my book, to have those.

There were a couple of times I turned the game off in frustration, usually during a couple of the platforming portions, and a couple of the more annoying boss battles, but mostly it was very enjoyable. Recommended.",positive
2632,"I just started playing this game so I have not even unlocked all the characters or events yet, but from what I have seen so far this game is a lot of fun.  You choose different characters to compete in four events in one group of events like track and field or swimming.  So far the only thing I don't like about this game is that for some of the events you have to move the stylus very fast along a bar and if you don't move it fast enough your character does not build up power to do well in the events.  But my arm gets tired moving the stylus like that over and over again.  The game can also get frustrating if you keep trying to qualify in events and you don't do well enough to qualify.  But overall, I would recommend this game.  Once you get into it, it is a lot of fun!",positive

You have to regain your powers because your memory has been wiped, but you get a new power at regular intervals. The story is not very clever or unique, but it's okay. The music is alright, too. The graphics are somewhat dull for Playstation 2, but they're clean. All around, this is an average game in most parts but it's very fun to play.",positive
2643,"This is a graphically beautiful, high quality, state of the art product.  The only thing I wish were different would be the addition of an offline mode.  Fun and violent.  A great way to spend your free time.",positive
2644,"This was great.  I'm actually still playing it, but unlike the first two, I'm not riveted to it.
My biggest problem with this, is that it seems to be a prequel, (kind of a Year One), except Batman has more toys than he ever did in the 1st two games.  Still, gameplay is awesome, graphics are amazing, and it would probably take weeks for an average player to completely finish this game.",positive
2645,"Pretty good Genesis controller to use with emulators. Used on my mac pro, plug-n-play - I already had the buffalo SNES style controller (HIGHLY Recommended) which is the best controller for emulation in terms of build, comfort - but I wanted this one to play fighting games on Genesis with the six button layout and a few flight games that needed the layout. I like and have been ""breaking it in"" the D-pad was real tight when opened, but my one complaint about it when compared to the ibufallo snes controller is that it is VERY noisy! The button pushing and D-pad moving make loud clicks, might annoy you if you're losing in a fighting game or spamming attack in a beat 'em up, Besides that great controller and I applaud hyperkin for giving us a USB version",positive
2646,"First of all, understand that novels could be written about almost any Grand Theft Auto game.

Also, understand that this particular author has been playing Grand Theft Auto since it was a top-down, 2-dimensional game on Pentium 100mhz systems.  The Playstation 1 was still the hottest gaming system in existence, and GTA was well beyond its capabilities.

GTA:San Andreas was simply a revolutionary game.  It provided a massive playing field with no load times - two firsts for the GTA series.  It also incorporated a wonderful handful of ""extracurricular activities"" that provided nothing whatsoever to the requirements of the game, but still gave players the opportunity for hours of additional entertainment.  I'm referring to such things as flying aircraft (even the hidden jumbo-sized jet,) customizing cars, managing large-volume garages, collecting money from acquired businesses, etc.  I played San Andreas for hours after beating it.

Most - if not all - of this content has been abandoned in this much-hyped Grand Theft Auto IV.  Note that I have not yet completed the game, but in just my first two hours of game play realized that GTA had in many ways gone back to the basics.  Yes, the visuals are amazing.  I am constantly impressed by the bullet holes that not only show up, but remain on the vehicles.  Just recently I noticed that each vehicle has an internal dome light.  Aerial views of the city (only available via helicopter as all jets and planes have been reverted back to the ""look but don't touch"" forms of pre-San Andreas games) are simply astounding.

But I think many gamers will agree that looks aren't everything.  Cars are incredibly difficult to drive - yes they handle much like the big, heavy cars we drive today.  They tend to understeer when braking, and oversteer when attempting high-speed, emergency-brake maneuvers.  Driving at high speeds has become a rather nerve-wracking ordeal, especially when being chased.  The most annoying inclusion is that of the cell phone - cleverly used to enhance core missions within the game, but otherwise a constant annoyance as other, non-player characters are constantly asking your character out on play dates.  Sorry - that's why I quit playing ""The Sims.""

The missions - in my opinion - are rather simplistic.  More annoyingly, they act as a seemingly unending tutorial as every mission teaches you a new skill (usually just a new button sequence) that then you seem to never use again.

GTA IV has returned to the days of nearly-linear, one-after-another, non creative missions with a few added ""modernizations"" like the afore-mentioned cell phones, internet cafes and toll booths (yes, I know - I'm not sure what they were thinking with that one, either.)  Gone is the stuff that made Gran Theft Auto fun, unique, and inventive.  My only hope is that they were simply testing the graphical limits of the newest generation in gaming consoles, and have much more up their sleeves for another version.

In a quick sidebar, the multiplayer aspects of GTA IV are much better than I expected.  I have already logged many hours simply romping around the city with friends and even family.  I won't hesitate to say that I am simply impressed with what they have managed to do with the [real] internet - this is what we've been missing for a very, very long time.  Does it save GTA IV?  Quite possibly.  Does it give you enough incentive to finish the game?  Not sure yet.

To put things to a close, Grand Theft Auto IV is a beautiful game with still a lot to do.  But GTA has been better, and in the end I can't help but feel dissapointed.

I also wish to offer my dissatisfaction to the online game-reviewing sites who have obviously offered stellar, ""perfect"" scores to an obviously undeserving game in the interest of extra income through promotions, advertisement and industrial ""butt kissing.""  Shame on you all.",positive
2647,"Wish I did not have to use the respective PS4 or Xbox 360 audio cable and it was true wireless but the battery life when using all audio (game and chat) through headset and sound quality make up for this. It is better than the official PS4 headset in sound quality, battery life and it can be used with the Xbox 360. A very long headset charging cable comes with this product and I find I can charge and use the headset at the same time as well. I would recommend this as an affordable headset to gamers who play with all sound through the headset and if you tend to play for long hours on some days.",positive

If you actually do the moves and don't worry about how silly you look, and you will look silly, then this can be a decent cardio workout, but you have to get into it.  A nice feature is the voice commands, they work surprisingly well, and its nice to not need to keep the controller handy for these types of games.

i've been reading some reviews, and there is something that needs to be addressed.  the last 2 or 3 reviews jumped all over the dead pixels like it was a sin.  in lcd screens, a few dead pixels will happen.  it happened on the DS too.  it all depends where it is, and what color for it to be an issue.  we had a DS that had a dead red pixel right in the middle of the screen, and that totally destroyed the experiance, but on one of our psp's, there was a dead black pixel up in the corner of the screen that blended right in with everything.  dead pixels happen, it sucks, but theres nothing you can do about it except send it back and get a new one.",negative

If you don`t have a good PC you might be in troubles, because you need speed and memory and a really good video card, and I tried to keep away from third party add ons because they always slow the performance.  but talking about the simulator, has a little more changes from FS2002, now with Taxiways signs and the More ATC comunication make flying a good experience.  I hope that in the next two years, microsoft can finally put real world airlines and try with more detailed sceneries.  Overall I like this game with 5 stars but I vote 4 because the performance capabilities from the pc.

The characters is Red Dead are cartoonish much like GTA but these feel just  a bit more exagerrated. In any case the mechanics and challenge system is very fun and entertaining, as is the unique firing mechanic. With great sound and even better graphics to boot it is sure fire winner

Vaio series is ,if I say to that simply, a active horror and action game. The main character of the game collect many weapons and curing items etc , you defeat the monsters that get to be stronger and storonger as story advance. The weapon is real too. For instance, the sound of the bullets, gravity feeling when the character have his gums at the ready...
When you use your bullets, there is fun that you consider the remaining bullets. And the sound is the horror sound. The monster are horror too.

It pulls you in, and with a good amount of suspence keeps you entertained.  The actual playthrough is a little on the downside for me though.  The controls are really good, but the whole 'gliding' aspect is a little difficult to get used to, especially for a 'non-gamer' like me.  This is the first game I played in over two years since I finished college and the moving is a little hard to get used to.  Most people will say that the games is a all-out-kill-everyone game and that is a downside, but I think that it acutally gives the player a more enjoyble expeirience.

2664,"Ever since operation RC was announced many people were unsure of what kind game it is. The producers of the game state the concept idea was ""KILL LEON"" and they built the game from there. As more and more detail were revealed many fans knew that this was a spin off title of the RE franchise, kind of like the gun survivor series. The enticing part of the game is in the title, the players would be playing in raccoon city and witnessing the chaos that befall the city in time period of RE2 and RE3. The players can alter event from the original games so in the end its a ""what if"" scenario. Neat idea huh? That's pretty much the games selling point.

You play as the bad guys essentially and your whole mission is to wipe any evidence leading back to your employer Umbrella. This is a cool and refreshing idea. Umbrella corp is the main antoganist throughout the early RE games and finally playing as them or at least a branch of them is still pretty cool. But at the same time its a dissapointment, the characters you play as are merely fan fiction they all look cool and are adapt at disposing zombies but lack anything to differentiate them from another except gender. They are faceless characters with cool voices. I wasn't expecting high caliber character development but at the same time they could of given more back story for some of them, in the end it feels rushed and most people want to play as the famous RE bad guys like HUNK for example.

The singleplayer is pretty bland and the worthwhile thing is playing through to see how you'll interact with the RE event from the original games or you want to shoot zombies with a friends. If your buying it for the latter I'd say skip this game there are a ton of games that offer more co op then this game offers. If your getting it strictly for the story your wasting you money as the single player in general is a missed oppurtunity. They could of made is it a lot more engaging in terms of the actual RE timeline. And the worst part is THERE IS NO COUCH CO-OP! this is a deal breaker if you don't play online its a waste of $60.

Multiplayer, now if your buying the game to play online your in for a treat. I'm currently enjoying the multiplayer a lot, and I rarely get hooked to online shooters. I play FPS casually if ever but this game I really like playing. Its different as in your not always worrying about other players but also B.O.Ws and of course the ever present zombies that litter every map. Surprisingly there is depth to the multiplayer. You gain exp for even killing zombies and other monsters this is small but helpful. The xp you get completing missions in singleplayer crosses over to the multiplayer and vice versa this is helpful for everyone and its indeed helpful if your going to be playing online heavily.

The depth in combat is interesting you have the standard shooting mechanic but sadly no option to change the controls. A cover system is there but its not good and can be a hassle. Its not a press button and viola cover, its more like a sticky cover where you press near a wall or whatever and you'll pop into cover. Its sound easy but sometime you won't have time to adjust when you'll be getting shot at.
Some other cool things about the online combat is the different classes they are all unique for the most part. Each has they're own abilities you can use effectively, you can later upgrade these to make them even more usefull. The medic for example has the ability to use a pheromones such as zombies or BOWs. Its satisfying to tag a enemy player and watch a Hunter go after them.

The modes are varied except for the standard team deathmatch which you've probably played in other games, its no different here except the zombies and bows running about.

The modes that you'll want to play are Heroes which lets you play as RE characters in two teams killing each others captains to win.
Survival is where a helicopter will come in about 4-5 min and if your not on it you'll be left behind, and there is only 4 spots in the copter. Everytime you die it takes longer to respawn.
Biohazard is capture the flag with vials instead of flags unoriginal but still fun.
The multiplayer will keep you busy, there isn't anything wrong with it that i can think of except for some glitches that can happen due to lag but most matches I've been in have been lag free and smooth.

OTHER THOUGHTS

I really didn't expect much from this game. I wanted to try out a multiplayer game since I have xbox live gold for about two more months. And I also wanted to see the scenarios in the singleplayer game. But the surprisingly the multiplayer has got me hooked and for that i'd say its $65 dollars well spent. And I bought the SE for less thanks to pre ordering it early. Thank you amazon

If your getting this for the single player please don't your paying for less content. This is a online/co op game first and single player second. If your looking for a online game with a RE setting then I'd say this game is definitely worth it. But its no way a representation of what resident evil should be online. Still eagerly awaiting another resident evil outbreak. Play it for what it is a spin off title like the gun survivor games.",positive
2665,Classic game. I love it,positive
2666,"My brother gave me this game. I love the Mario games and he said this is as close to Mario as is available right now. At first I was very skeptical. I figured I would play this game only with my four year old boy. But the game surprised me.

First let me say that this game can't hold a candle to Mario, it does have it's strengths. It is a fun arcade like game where you jump and zip, smash, and collect things to give you points. It is a lot more fun than I had expected and I do find myself playing it without my boy on occasion as well. Though he does also like to watch the play ( in 2d of course).

Even though the game is a little repetitive at parts, it is fun for short bursts, and definitely great for the young ones. I would rate this game only three stars but it surprised me and became fun, so because of being pleastenly surprised I gave it a fourth star. Though it reall y should be three and a half, there just is no option for that.",positive

2668,"I own guitar hero 2 and 80's and have played the original. This game is tied for best with G2. I love it! There's some great songs on here: Paint it Black, 3's and 7's, One...finally some Metallica, and its a blast to play! The bonus songs you buy from the store are blahh, at least the ones I've played so far, none as fun as some of the ones in G2. In career mode sometimes instead of encores, you have battles, where you battle Slash etc. to a guitar-off. This took a little getting used to, but was a nice change of pace.
 I can't really comment too much on the new guitar controller, I bought the bundle pack, but still use my red guitar since there's no point in killing the batteries when playing alone. Although the black on black guitar looks awesome.
More clothes, guitars(some totally awesome) and new characters to buy in the store. Oh and what's up with offing Pandora? Get rid of Judy Nails ughh! At least my homegirl Casey and Lars Ummwhatshisface are back for G3

2670,"For those who played Wii sports boxing, this game is a world of difference in graphics, feel, tone, and above all effort required! No longer do you have to more or less just flick the controllers or just punch as many times as possible. The MOVE and FIGHT make you master your fighting techniques, aim your punches, and hit hard. I have lost as many matches as I have won against the CPU. I am not a trained fighter - it must be said - but I'm happy that as far as I can tell there are no quick cheats to win. As I go up in level, the opponent gets much tougher.

The downsides? I haven't quite figured out the trick punches, the fighter (you) is not transparent, limiting to an extent the camera view, and losing so often is a bit frustrating - but that's what makes the game challenging.

As I say in my title - WHAT A WORKOUT! The price of this game is well worth the exercise I get.",negative

We also take turns racing in the circuit mode(one player) and see who can place 4th or better. As you race through the tracks you can pick up nitro's that helps you fight your way from the rear or you can pick up cash that you can later buy stuff that helps beef up your vehicle. This is a simple game to learn and play and challenging enough to keep you interested. My 7 year old enjoys it also because she can also win, so nobody dominates the game.",negative

2675,"This card is worthwhile mainly if you do not wish to use your credit card on the NET and have one less location storing your financial information. I purchase this when Amazon has it on sale or at least at a price that would be less than the 3-month recurring charge you can purchase direct. And now that you can purchase the card and receive free shipping it usually is able to meet my criteria.

This prepaid card at the current price allows you to play the game cheaper than if you pay month-to-month or using the three months recurring plan by using a credit card with Blizzard. For me the added security of not having to give your credit card info for your subscription is a great bonus and this is perfect for anyone who wants to purchase a gift of playing time for anyone they know that plays the game.",positive
2676,"Battlefield One is a great game, it offers a lot of fun especially for those who prefer online play. The story mode of the game is also great, but at the same time I feel it could have been longer considering this is a game made in 2016. The story can be beaten in a few short hours and if you decide to do all the small extra things you can get a couple of more hours out of it. The most upsetting part of length is that the story is so well made and just a lot of fun that I crave more then the few chapters we get. One other issue is that the game doesn't offer a lot of the main countries involved in WWI and as someone who studied the war it is really disappointing, but to casual players it shouldn't be that big of a deal. If you enjoy first person shooters especial war related ones then this game is for you. It offers a lot you will be familiar with but also adds a lot to the subject due to the setting.",positive

Not a waste of time at all.,neutral
2679,"Pure Gothic Horror. Those are the 3 words I use to best describe this excellent action game on the Playstation PS1. The graphics are very well done, and the music is suitably creepy and ominous. The atmosphere is definitely strong in this game. It will either creep you out, or draw you in. My first experience with the game was playing a demo for it before it was released, and I kept coming back to it. Why? Because it was so original, and reminded me of the classic monster movies such as Dracula and the Werewolf. The game is even set in the 1800's!
The music sets the mood. It is mostly just orchestra with some digital thrown in, even some organ music from time to time. The intro to the game is perfect, and one of the best horror intros I have ever seen!
Basically, once you begin playing this game, you will not be able to stop!
Two playable characters right from the start. You use a weapon, a gun with limited ammo, and your martial arts moves. There are puzzles to solve, and the graphics are similar to Tomb Raider games. Everything about this game is almost perfect, except it's easy to get stuck without  knowing where to go, and the controls take a lot of getting used to. They are good overall, but a little stiff.
I am not sure how long the game is, as I have not finished it. But I have played it about 3 hours and gotten to 3 stages. Sometimes the bosses are a bit hard. Great game overall. Check it out if you like horror games.",positive
2680,"Got the Kinect back in 2010. The games are a lot of fun to play. Does a great job mimicking every move you make. The game that comes with the Kinect is very fun. We now have 6 different Kinect games. Some of the games are a little harder to play. The reason for 4 stars is some of the voice commands don't register or you have to talk really loud for the Kinect to hear you. I notice this most when we are using to amazon instant video app to watch shows. Saying things like pause, play or next episode we seem to have to talk really louder say it more than once. Some of the games like madden or nba2k it doesn't always work to call audible of set screens. But still overall a great device. We recently moved and only have 8 feet of distance between the Kinect and where we can stand. Some of the games don't pick up the feet movement. But you can still play the games.

2684,"...But sadly, not the best.  The graphics and gameplay in ""Agent Under Fire"" are fantastic, but at times the game is way too easy. While this in itself is not so bothersome, it does leave something to be desired once you complete the game.
You are 007, the agent who needs no introduction, and it is your job to save the world (a cliched spy plot that still works, suprisingly), which is done by completing various missions. What I love about this game is the diversity. In ""Goldeneye"" you were almost always on foot, running after and shooting baddies. In this game, you can race through the streets in the BMV Z8, or shoot enemies out of the back of your car while your sexy female sidekick drives. Also included  are a variety of new toys, like a laser to cut off locks, or a claw to latch onto high places.
The graphics and music are stunning, taking full advantage of the Gamecube's abilities. The animation and cinematics are also well done, and very life-like. This is the next best thing to being Bond.
The flaws mentioned before are not crippling, but I would have liked a little more challenge. Personally, I prefer ""Goldeneye"" for N64, simply for the depth. Don't listen to anyone who says ""Buy the Xbox or PS2 versions instead"", they are exactly the same game, and the pros and cons apply to all versions.",positive
2685,"PROS:
No loading times between entrances. Gameplay feels and looks like a real WWE match. More moves and animations. New reversal system is an enjoyable addition. Soundtrack is better than last years game. CAW is what it should have been last year. Universe mode is still fun. Huge roster! Most character models look impressive.

CONS:
Ladder matches, Table matches, and Cage matches all need an overhaul with more grapple interactions. No original or generic entrances for CAWs. Need more music options, and original designs for CAWs. Commentary still sucks, (but in Showcase mode, its a champ).

This is not the greatest wrestling game of all time, but it has all the ingredients to make it one of the best. There are glitches and errors within the gameplay. The new submission system takes some time to learn. Also, I wish they would let us modify match types between rivalries in Universe mode without erasing the rivalry.  MyCareer has made improvements, but like last years mode can get stale and repetitive. I wish they would keep a record of your stats in MyCareer, so you can keep track of your wins and losses. Overall, I am very happy with the game. I just hope 2K releases a few more patches to fix technical issues and add certain improvements to modes.",neutral
2686,"Ahhhh....here we are, another year another Madden. So, whta do we have...Roster Update? Check. Improved Graphics? Check. New EA tracks? Check. In short,Madden is getting there...it's slowly but surely starting to get up to the standards that NFL 2K5 set FOUR years ago.

Is it me, or do you have a feeling that this SHOULD have been Madden 08?

Let's quickly talk about some of what EA finally got right...and believe it or not a lot of those things are small nitpicky things that have bugged me for years.

1. Commentary....FINALLY after 3 tries they finally have 2 man play by play and it's decent! I still think Visual Concepts did it a bit better but in most ways, EA finally gets this one right and Cris Collinsworth and Tom Hammond sounds pretty well together but it also does need some work as they hardly ever say the names of players during the game.

2. TV presentation style - EA got it right but you still have to ask the, if they have access to the ESPN licence along with exclusivity, wny not rip the page out of 2K5's book and run with it? But...you can't complain too much as what is given this year still feels a lot less clunky than last year and marshall Faulk's pregame crap is gone...however, they still could have left in the pre game intro.
Also, Chris Collinsworth with the telestrator is a welcome improvement and gives you more of a feel of 'watching' the game.

3. More animations and enhanced graphics- by far this is one of the nicest looking games released in awhile....the stadiums look more alive now that they have varied the look and AI of the crowds. There are more on field animations from the players and a lot less broken animations from broken up plays...but...where are the refs?? The lighting effects are nicer this time around really giving you a feel of 'being there' at the prescribed time of day...even the weather effects as stated really do have an effect...a lot more sliding around and uglier games in worse weather and of course uni's getting dirty. The sidelines also show a big improvement.

4. The AI is getting better on D as some plays that were easily paydirt plays are constantly getting shut down and the D will definently adjust more as you keep using certain plays so it's wise to learn to use audibles a bit more especially in hurry up situaions. The AI also seems to be getting better managing the ball in late game situaions...I have seen too many times in past maddens when the AI attempts ot run the ball late in the 4 the quarter when they need to be throwing it deep and this iteration, you really do and some teams depending on the QB is also going to stretch the field on you if they can.

What are some things that still need improving on.

1. The franchise mode - There was so many things that Madden 04 and 05 did right that made the franchise mode fun and I still can't see why they won't bring it back to the next gen systems...I kind of enjoyed managing my team syadiums and tix prices and so on....but none of that has made it back....and BTW until or unless EA comes out with a roster update, you will have to manually make changes to Favre, Thaylor and Pennington. Also I still would like to see other game highlights and scores while my game is playing...I mean come on EA...that's going to determine how much harder I am going to play if I can see how the rest of my division is doing thru that Sunday!!!

2. The halftime show.....ok...so they finally got rid of the cheerleaders last year...but come on now, 2K5 had it down to a T....EA get on the band wagon...again you have the ESPN licence...what are you guys waiting on?

3. More Realism - Where is the cart for injured players? Where arethe refs? Where is the chain gang? EA we are 4 iterations into the NEXT GEN...get with it!! Speaking of the refs...is it just me or can I barely understand him at times?

4. Sound - sigh....when is EA going to stop using the SAME CANNED crowds sound from 199X??? again, this is something that 2K5 had a bit more on the right side that EA really needs to improve. Crowds boo at dumb plays...they get seriously hyped as a great play goes...if Adrian Peterson breaks out into an open field run on the way to a TD, I should hear the stadium explode...not the same sounding static.

Finally some things EA needs to dump.

1. The rewind mode - 'nuff said....you didn't want that play broken...you shouldn't have picked it...suck it up. Thankfully you can turn that feature off.

2. Madden IQ - if you play one really good game, the next one rachets itself up too high for you to keep up plus you can adjust your diffulty level so why bother? Definently the gimmick for this year.",neutral
2687,"It's a really cool little controller. I carry it in my bag for when I'm at work or traveling. I don't like the fact that I need to reconnect it every time I turn it back on, but for longer gaming sessions it keeps the connection. The material is good and it's more than just a novelty because it works pretty well! I use it for emulators on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2017 model). Any system after the N64 is a bit tricky because there aren't enough buttons on the controller to assign one for everything you'll need, and there's no right thumbstick equivalent so you probably won't play anything too advanced.",negative

2690,"Now, there are a lot of reviews out there already for this game. I'm just going to say that I enjoyed Oblivion through several playthroughs and it has above average replayability, character customization, and community / mod support (everything from fixing the UI, to improving or streamlining the graphics, to offering new armor / clothing styles, etc.).  Plus theres a pretty good wiki for it, with info on practically everything in the game (google oblivion wiki).

The good :

The plot - it takes you in from the start. I played Morrowind (the third game in the series) at least three times, and quit each time because the plot was... boring or non-existant. To this day, I still can't remember what Morrowind was about, and I got pretty far into it. Some may think the plot in Oblivion is overused (there are parallels to Arcanum and Doom), but I like those parallels. It takes you in and puts you are the center of the world, so to speak. Definitely has some distant Roman-empire influence in the location and characters centralized in the imperial capital (and dealings with the empire and council - being vague to avoid spoilers). But it's safe to say you'll meet a lot of people with names that end in -ius, -ia and -um, often in Roman triplicate. So yea, if you're a little fascinated by the Romans, the Imperial City might be interesting to you.

Character and leveling system : slightly simplified from Morrowind, but overall it's a complex system with distant parallels to DnD (stats and skills). Training is a little less repetitive this time.  I like having stats (attributes) and skills.  Because the difficulty is adjustable, you don't have to min/ max or focus on ""optimizing"" your leveling, though if you like that, you can do that as well.

Combat : pretty straight forward and fun with melee, bows, and stealth. Magic is a bit harder to figure out but still very powerful (hint: The the Mages Guild charter book tells you spell specialties of each town.)

Difficulty is basically anything you want with an adjustment slider.

Dungeons - tons of them, they respawn in time, and enemies are usually the same level as you.  I like the feature as an alternative to traditional ""leveling"" or grinding.  You can basically go anywhere you want, as fast or as slow as you want, and the game will mostly adapt.

Graphics - Looks amazingly beautiful if you enable HDR (or bloom) / water effects / high quality textures.  Without the fancy lighting enabled, it looks kind of dated, but for me at least, the graphics seem sufficient for 2012 (and still GPU intensive).

The bad :

Generic dialogs : for the most part, I don't think the NPCs really care about you. Though every dialog is voice-acted, most seem generic (as opposed to say Arcanum, BG, etc., where the dialogs were determined by say your characters charisma, intelligence, gender, class etc.), and read out like an answering machine. The dialog isn't really 'social' and quests simply fall into the player's lap, which makes sense but lowers realism since our character is pretty much reduced to a town hero/ine that solves everyone's problems great and small (and more often, small).

Stupid NPCs :  In a game that prefers quantity over quality, here you have the usual Bethesda legion of NPCs without any character, personality, or spirit.  There are probably 3-5 NPCs that had characterization or were otherwise memorable,and most of those are key players in the main quest.  The rest remind me of an answering machine message, spouting out information without actually hearing or interacting with the player.

Console port interface : 30 hours in and I was still flipping thru the F-keys trying to find stuff. Mods do improve the interface and everything else.

Many NPCs can't be killed (a pity since many are annoying and the dialog options severely limited).  Many allied NPCs can be killed by 'friendly fire' when they throw themselves in front of you in combat.

The main quest is horribly linear (as in practically on rails), and most side quests have only 1 solution.  Forget about complex dialogs or saying something aggressive or threatening to an npc, it's almost always a choice of ""yes ma'am I'll do the quest,"" or ""no ma'am, I don't have time.""

That being said, the game is another attempt at a sandbox style RPG, and creates a limited illusion of a world, working really well if you want to play ""the hero,"" but probably not so well if you want to play a gray or evil character.

The linearness and the shallowness of the NPCs are why I'm giving it only 4 stars.  In a sense, it has the opposite problem of Morrowind - being too far directed toward pre-defined ends and making your character into a Mary Sue that always is the center of the universe (which only seems to make the universe even more shallow). There are tons of places to explore and millions of things to do, but very little worth doing, since you can be fairly certain to find predictable dungeons or dull NPCs with run of the mill ""fetch this"" quests. ""Quantity is its own Quality,"" or is it not?

The Elder Scrolls games in general are good at creating a huge world, but not so good at all at creating worlds and niches and locales and little stories that populate and connect the whole.  To throw out a counter example, recent GTA games, while being just as linear, have much much more characterization and memorable dialogue while still offering a large sandbox.  This is the price, I guess you pay with games like oblivion - a big world, and a lot of character customization, but not really much depth to the worlds.",positive
2691,Great game. But now its unavailable just like every blockbuster Playstation exclusive. Now i have to use best buys gamer club program which i found out is far cheaper!!!,positive
2692,"Ray and Thomas McCall are ex-Confederate soldiers, on the run from their former commander, who has labeled them deserters and who refused to lay down arms when the South lost.  They head to Juarez in search of a mythical treasure, with which they can buy back their home that was damaged during Sherman's march.

Plot-wise, CALL OF JUAREZ: BOUND IN BLOOD is so-so; it starts off as a war story (the first chapter takes place during the Civil War, fighting the North), moves into a western, and eventually congeals as a half-baked adventure story.  It's good enough for a video game, at any rate.  The graphics are outstanding, the voice acting is good for the most part (Ray's accent isn't quite consistent, and some of the characters just seem...well, not up to par).  The real catch here, though, is the game play.  Is there anything better than riding a horse while firing a gun from each hand?  I didn't think so.  JUAREZ offers classic western game play: there's the repeating rifle, the quickdraw revolver, the double-barreled shotgun, dynamite, lasso, throwing knives, horses, stagecoaches, Gatling guns, Comanche warriors, shoot-outs, high noon duels...it's all here.  JUAREZ is like your favorite childhood western, but with more blood and bullets.

So why the four-star rating?  Well, the game has its flaws, as most games do.  The in-game weapons change menu is stubborn; it quite often won't change weapons when you need it to (and you need it to); the problem is, it happens in real-time, so that the game doesn't pause while you're doing it.  I don't know how many times I died because, when I went to change weapons, the game couldn't keep up with me.  Also, it gets kind of hard to dodge obstacles, and every now and then, you'll get stuck (often right when you don't want to); similarly, I found myself ducking (thanks to PS3 controls) when I didn't intend to, thus slowing my movement.  The Cover Mode (an otherwise ingenious invention that allows you to shoot from behind cover) also kicks in automatically; you get near the edge of cover, and whether you want to or not, you find yourself drifting into Cover Mode.  And then there's the usual bit about bodies disappearing...that's always bugged me in games.

The flaws can be ignored, however; the game is definitely fun to play.  For most chapters, you get to choose which brother you want to be.  You can choose wisely, or do as I did, and play once through as Ray, and again as Thomas; Ray can wield two guns, as well as dynamite, is best with revolvers, and can carry the Gatling gun; Thomas is faster, better with rifles, can climb obstacles Ray can't (thus getting to places you can't go to as Ray), and wield the lasso and knives.  I should mention that my game froze up during the 4th chapter, and I ended up losing all my progress; the upside was that I replayed as a different character (when applicable), so that I got a richer experience.  CALL OF JUAREZ: BOUND IN BLOOD is perhaps one of the funnest games I've played.  But then, I was one of those kids who played cowboys and Indians and didn't give a damn about accuracy or political correctness.  If you're like me, then trust me, this is your game.",positive

2694,"This is a game that I had no interest in buying, However I found it on sale and gave it a try, and after playing it I was glad I played it. It takes an original approach to storytelling, at first it was a turn off, but after the first hour I found that the way they tell the story actually works well. I cannot go into too much detail other than, stick with it even if it seems weird at first, but the game play and story get better and it turns out to be a great action game. I like the fact that they tried to be different, and it pays off. I played the game on Normal, and took me about 10 hours to complete, great for a rainy weekend. I want to play this game again on a harder level, and I have read playing it on hard or higher levels will take 15+ hours as aiming takes a lot longer. It has several settings to fit your style and level of game play, even if you are not good at action shooters, there is a setting for hard locking, meaning you it the target button and it locks onto a target for you, you have to do little aiming. If you want a little challenge then it has soft targeting, and then for the pros no targeting (which honestly would be too hard for me).

After swapping out ps2's and getting the exact same results with discs, that let me know it's the games and not the system causing the problems so I bought a NEW Shoalin Monks and so far it works perfectly. I was being cheap but it's probably best to spend a bit more money to get the best quality as so far I purchased 2 ps2 games that won't play but swapped them out for better quality that play perfectly so go for ""new"" or ""like new"" is my advise on older products",positive
2702,"First off, the graphics are nice and the game's theme is pretty darn awesome.  As the game's title implies, you're an assassin that goes on missions to kill a variety of different people.  The cities are quite large and bustling with a bunch of people.  Sometimes you actually feel like you're in a living world as you walk along blending in with the populace.

Some downsides would be the controls, which take some getting used to.  The plot line is also kind of corny although I enjoyed it.  And, I can't help but hold this against the game, but you can basically assassinate anyone with impunity.  It wasn't uncommon for me to make a mistake with the controls and accidentally do a leap onto some hapless civilian, plunging a knife into their neck.  Sure, some people would scream and run away, but otherwise it's business as usual.  I don't think this makes the game bad, but it sort of detracts from the realism.

If you've ever wondered what it's like being an assassin for a secret society, this is the game for you!",positive

2706,"I am about 10 hours in to Mafia III. I do think it is a good game. However, I do think it could be better as well. WARNING: SOME SMALL SPOILERS.

Here is my list of PROS and CONS:

PROS:
If you buy it now and have prime you get the game for 48 dollars, and I think it is worth 48 dollars.
The story is one the best stories I've seen in a long time. It really keeps me engaged. I enjoy listening to the story of Lincoln Clay, and the cut scenes of other characters describing how ruthless Lincoln Clay and some others were. It is also really cool how some of the ""social"" issues in this game are directly in line with some of the stuff going on in present day. The developers did not hold back with some of the content. Some games truly are not ""M"", but this one surely is. I applaud the developers for really not holding back, and letting us know how it really felt to be a black man in that time period.
I know there are a bunch of reviews about bugs, I personally have not experienced any bugs. The patches must of cleared that up, and they came numerous and quickly. If you buy the game now, you should not have any bugs.
The graphics are fantastic and really show how life was back in the day. You really feel as if you are playing in another time period.
I LOVE the ""gun"" van. It is always a pain traveling to a gun store in GTA. This feature in Mafia III saves you some much time, and really allows you to play the game without always traveling to a ""store"". The same is said about changed made to card. I do not like how GTA does it. The Mafia developers got that aspect right.

Cons:
Some of the missions seem to be very repetitive. They could of made some changes to how the missions worked, but it almost seems like they got lazy at the end. Oh well...
I don't like the take down feature, you have to switch on and off brutal take down vs non brutal take down in the main menu. I don't know why they just didn't put a different button for each.
The explosives could be better. There is not much variety in terms of explosives. I also don't like how you use them or how you switch them in your inventory.",positive
2707,"This is a great old school basic fighting game.  There's a bunch of moves, characters, and unlockable features.  The only thing is when you're playing with someone as with most fighting games, certain characters only need certain moves to win, making it very boring and aggrivating.

Fighting games aren't really my type, but this one you can have a lot of fun with.  Just know that fighting someone for fun is much different than fighting for pure victory.  It's weird, to think about it, but you can't have fun when someone else is using the same move over and over and you can't do anything about it.",positive
2708,"Hitman Contracts did a lot of things right.  The missions are much more open, the interaction is improved, and even the load times seem smaller.  If you liked the previous Hitman games this certainly will work for you, I loved even the first Hitman game despite the then horrible control interface in the PC version of Hitman I.  So all of that is better, but there still are some snags.

1) the enemy A.I. remains lacking.  You can still just ambush them as they run stupid one after another past a door.

2) the briefings are horrible, I though Hitman 2 explained a lot more what was expected of the mission.  In this case you often have to stumble a bit to find some of the crucial aspects.

3) there is no plot.  I always thought this was going to be a straight up prequel. But the ""story"" is mostly the memories of 47 as he is wounded and remembering his past contracts. This form creates a very strong disconnect between missions as well.

4) there are limits on save games per level.  I just hate that, specially since I love to try to kill no one but the target, which means a lot of risks and potential loading. IMHO this was done only to increase the hours of gameplay since the game is relatively short. And considering how sometimes a simple error can ruin your stealth; it is easy to press a wrong button and accidentaly pull out a gun, or a common programming error where a guard sees you through doing something you wish he hadn't seen.  That sort of stuff is mostly ok, but I wish there wasn't a limit on saves per level.

That said I don't wish to paint too negative of a picture. It is still Hitman, it still is pretty good, and it is a great step up from the original Hitman.  It just didn't feel better than Hitman 2.",negative
2709,"One of, if not the best baseball game I've ever played, but it is really difficult.",neutral
2710,"I picked up the guitar bundle at a store because it was 30 bucks. The game is the best guitar hero since legends of rock by a long shot. World tour was abysmal and 5 was alright. the gameplay is good, the setlist is good, and it seems like a well polished game. The guitar is very nice looking, but it feels small and heavy, and when I strum down is has a terrible squeak (may need to get broken in). I am a loyal rock band player and this game is pretty close to the quality of rock band. Some things that really piss me off about the game: the awful noise when you miss a note, the wiimote vibrating(can be turned off), the circular notes, hard to read patterns. The gameplay is still not quite as good as rock band but its pretty good for guitar hero.

This is a good game HOWEVER i would not pay $85 for it. It is nothing more than a track pack and a solid guitar hero game. you are not going to be blown away by this game, but you will be satisfied.",positive
2711,"Nice... not as good as most wanted or carbon, but still entertaining.  Story line, graphix, and video shoots were best of the line of N4S games, but game play and difficulty was sub-par.  The cops were a joke in this game... very ez to evade and the cpu competition was also a joke.",positive
2712,"Finally an expansion pack that is worthy of The Sims (the greatest game of all time). Vacation brings life back into The Sims in a huge way!!! I couldn't even estimate the amount of hours that my girlfriend and I have spent playing The Sims over the past couple of years. I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed in Hot Date simply because I think that I was expecting more than it actually delivered. Vacation, however brings all of the expansions together and makes the game more fun than ever before!!! I absolutely love taking the family ""out of town"" for the weekend. The new objects also make for incredible building opportunities or simple add-ons.
 Obviously I am a fan of The Sims and do have all of the expansions for the game. The special thing about Vacation is that it opens up such a wide variety of activities for your sims. I personally like the snowboarding and snowball fights, where my girlfriend can go metal detecting for days (in Sims time). The cloning options are also practically endless for all of the people who like to create their own objects. All in all I think that Vacation is the best expansion since Livin' Large. Of all of the pros to this particular expansion, I have personally found only one con, and that is the load time. I have noticed that since I installed Vacation, my game loads considerably slower than it had before. For this reason alone, I gave the game four satrs instead of five. I highly recommend this expansion to anyone who likes The Sims.",positive

I am very happy with my purchase.  The system doesn't come with a block power supply which is amazing.

The stand comes in a nice box, so it would make a great gift.  Keep in mind that it requires 2 AAA batteries which are not included, and you'll need a tiny screwdriver to get the battery cover off.  I used an electronics screwdriver, but a glasses repair kit will probably work too.

The stylus is larger than your normal 3DS stylus, but due to the shape of the guard (the blue part that sticks out on the sides) it isn't very comfortable to hold.  It is also flat instead of round, so it's awkward to hold.  I'm not taking a star away because I never intended to use it as a stylus because I have a large stylus I bought here on Amazon instead, but  if you wanted to use the Master Sword as a stylus, you're going to be disappointed.

I intended to use this display stand with my Wolf Link Amiibo from Twilight Princess, but I was concerned it would be too small because it is a wider Amiibo than most.  It actually fits really well.  My largest Amiibo, the Guardian from Breath of the Wild (the big machine with the tentacles, not the four heroes; the Goron hero is large but fits), ""fits"", but it only goes in one way, and it presses on the stylus in a bad way, so I would say that even though it can technically fit, it doesn't really work because that Amiibo is too big.  See picture.

When you put the sword/stylus in the stand, it makes a Zelda sword slash sound.  When you remove the sword from the stand, it plays a song.  I was hoping for the classic Zelda puzzle-discovery or treasure-obtaining songs, but it's not those, which was very disappointing. It's actually the song that plays when Link removes the Master Sword in Twilight Princess, which is appropriate, but not a memorable song like the other iconic sounds.  I removed one star for this, even though I recognize it is my personal prefernce, I think many of you Zelda fans will share it.  Still, this is a great way to display your love for the Legend of Zelda games and hold your Amiibo at the same time. Overall, I can highly recommend it to anyone, and it would make a great gift.  4/5 stars.

2717,"I am predominantly a simracer rather than an arcade racer, so I am reviewing this from the biased perspective of someone who typically likes Forza2, RacePro and Gran Turismo. I have never played any of the NFS games. But I have played and enjoyed the Burnout games. So I DO like arcade racers now and then too.

Pros:
- The presentation is hip and energetic with pulsing sound effects and visuals.
- The audio is cranked all the way up by default. So if you are using a driving seat with some kind of vibration system like an Aura Bass Shaker or Buttkicker, you will need to turn it down. Mine started getting pretty hot in a matter of a few minutes compared to games like Forza 2 and Race Pro- which would barely warm the units up.
- Cockpit view feels less claustrophobic than GT Prologue. Not sure why.
- Camera shake does definitely add to the realism and excitement.
- Money is earned pretty quickly so you can buy new cars- a lot less grinding compared to GTP. Also when you buy a car, you can later turn around and sell it for the same price as you bought it.
- The beginning of the game puts you through a trial race from which it provides you with a recommendation of the gameplay settings. This is a nice touch- especially for introducing newbies to the genre.

Cons:
- Although the presentation is more ""hip"" it is also much more cluttered. There is often too much graphics and too many statistics presented to you both in the HUD and after the race.
- Program is not entirely bug free. It froze on me twice. And on another occasion I was able to start racing BEFORE the green light!
- Load times are pretty long so I recommend installing it on your harddrive- which helps a little.
- Even in Pro mode (i.e. no traction control, stability, and abs) it felt easier to control than Forza 2, and definitely easier than Race Pro.
- The force feedback on the wheel appears weaker than Forza 2. I was surprised it was already set at 10/10 by default.
- Cars do not appear to be visually as pleasing as Forza 2 or as accurate as GT Prologue. For example, the rear airfoil in the Audi TT does not raise automatically at greater than 75mph- which it does in GTP.
- Quick Race mode gives you a limited set of cars to start with. Although you earn cash pretty quickly and you can buy them.
- Cars are pretty aggressive on occasion, forcing you off the track on purpose. But at the same time, sometimes you see it do some really weird turns (that are not a result of a spinout) and decelerations that seem to indicate the AI decided to revert to following its rail.

On the whole NFS is simracing from a NFS perspective. It's a good effort for the NFS franchise. They presumably want to try and keep their existing customers (who tend to prefer a more arcade-style experience) but at the same time take a small nibble at the simracing piece of the pie currently dominated by Forza, Gran Turismo, and others.

Hardcore Simracers will probably be better off sticking to the Forza and Gran Turismo series.  Forza3's new ability to wind back time so you can redo a portion of the race will likely be the top feature in the game- allowing you to practice a corner over and over.

I think casual games will still find this game enjoyable for the excitement-drenched visual and audio experience. I find that even though I am a semi-hardcore simracer,  this title does grow on you after a while.

Addendum:
I recently played the demo version of Forza 3. Here's a quick comparison against NFSS:

F3's driving physics definitely does feel more accurate. E.g. on the Audi R8 about 70% of the power is supposed to be in the rear wheels and 30% in the front. In F3, it feels right. If you do too sharp a turn and hit the gas too hard, you will oversteer. In NFSS however, the R8 feels like a front wheel drive vehicle- in a hard corner, I can usually turn the wheel in the direction I want to go and just floor the gas, and eventually the car will straighten out. Your car almost never oversteers. I do admit though that NFSS' version of the R8 physics does make it more fun sometimes- you can whip your wheel around on a hard corner and just floor the gas- gives you a heroic feeling when taking an insane corner- which admittedly is not a good way to drive on a real race track.

The steering vibration in F3 is much stronger, and it really adds to the illusion of weight of the car. So if you through a serious of left/right turns quickly, the wheel will pull very hard in both directions and it really gives you the sensation that your car's weight is being flung from side to side.

NFSS' gas pedal feels a lot less ""analog"" than F3. NFSS' response tends to feel like it's a 1 or 0. F3 feels about right. You step on the gas gradually and you can feel and hear the gradual build up of power.

F3's cockpit is closer in view so you can see the dials more clearly. However the rendering of the cockpit is not as detailed as NFSS- and certainly much less detailed than Gran Turismo Prologue. Also with the closer cockpit view in F3, half of the rear-view mirror is truncated.

Even though I tend to prefer realistic racing sims, I find I really missed the camera shake in NFSS. It really does add a lot to the experience. When I play F3, it just feels rather tranquil by comparison.

NFSS' replay camera view is incredibly weak- there is really only 1 view. F3 has brilliant camera views. Just about every conceivable camera view is included. I have never seen so many views in a racing game. This is particular important if you are serious about analyzing your driving. And just as in Forza 2, you can toggle on/off detailed telemetry about your car.

However, still,  the one feature that makes F3 the hands down winner, is the ability to rewind time so you can retake a corner. I found myself using this quite often and really appreciating it the more I use it- especially so that I don't have to restart the race just because I spun out toward the end of the last lap. However, I can see that this can be such a powerful crutch that people will over use it... perhaps forgetting that in real life there are no undos when it comes to real car racing... But for now I am thankful the feature is there. It is such a great learning tool.",positive

2725,"Yea, there are some annoying things, but the fun far outweighs thems. One big plus is that all of your stuff from one difficulty level transferes to the more diffucult level. So you beat the game on amature mode, and the weapons and goodies transfere to vetran level and then to profesional level. Once you fully upgrade a weapon, you can make it have unlimited ammo. The annoying parts are when you have a high combo on mercenaries and a zombie puts you in a full-nelson. Probably the most annoying thing in video game history is that an enemy hits hard on mercenaries and enstead of taking a first aid spray, you have to rapidly hit o to pull yourself together.

It fits comfortably in my hand, the lights it gives off are cool, (sometimes I actually get distracted by them during a game and end up taking damage or even dying, heh heh.) but the only complaint I have is, actually, the lights. In hindsight, I should have purchased the mouse that also has a SEPARATE button for the lights, because for this, you have to hold the forward button down to change them, and, being forgetful like me, I tried to play Assassin's Creed II with the mouse, went to shove people out of the way so I wouldn't get caught....And the button didn't register as the game control, and instead just kept changing the lights...

2727,"I have played Sim games since the original (and very basic) Sim City game came out sometime in the late 80s.
I did not expect the GameBoy Advance version of SIMS to be just like the PC game.  How could it?  Even my PC can't handle that game at times.
However, for such a small, portable system as GBA I think this is a very well done game.
The locations are much more extensive than I expected -- and the game play is very well thought out.
(If only TSO had been thought out this well.... sigh.)
There are many NPCs and many, many goals.
Making money is not tiresome... and you see results and game advancement constantly.
I suspect that if I played this non-stop I could probably have it finished in a day or so -- but since it is SIMS -- there are still other things I could go back and do as a different SIM, in a different game.
I could sass people instead of being nice... I could pee in public and get arrested... I could probably even practically live in the local bar if I wanted (although this would delay ""advancement"" it is another way I could choose to play).
I am sure this is not as flashy as the Bustin Out for GameCube or other consoles... and I know it is nothing when compared with current PC Sim games... but for a game smaller than my thumb -- that works on a console I can fit in my pocket -- it is an excellent product.",neutral

Pros:

- very varied environments that are relatively large.

- varied environments also offer unique environmental characteristics that come into play in the game- like turrets.

- get to blow up a star destroyer.

- the instant action games featuring essentially deathmatch with jedi are fun- fight as either yoda, mace, ki-adi-mundi, aayla secura, obiwan, luke, han, leia, boba fett, darth vader, maul, anakin, & the emperor

- conquest mode plays like Risk and motivates you to fight thru all the battles.

- Soundtrack consists of classic star wars themes

Cons:

- Controls are difficult- mainly because of limited PSP controls.

- Space battles in conquest mode are very repetitive.

- after the conquest game is over, where you have gone thru over 20 campaigns, the game just says ""Victory""... That's it, no celebration of any sort, no ending cutscene- talk about a lazy way to end the game.

- Controls in game are not correctly documented in manual. Best to use Default controls even though Basic is easier. Default controls allow your jedi to block. Basic controls do not.

A decent title for the PSP. Well worth getting when it hits discount. Worth getting new for SW fans that have played all the games.",positive
2737,"I Just got done playing this with 3 other people at a LAN party, and I can safely say that this expansion is worth the money if you enjoy the C&C multiplayer experience.  The new campaigns are ok, but Zero Hour definetely seems to have a much stronger focus on the multiplay aspect, which really is well done.  It also has a nifty solo-player matchup mode called ""challenge,"" where you're pitted against a specific general who's army has certain unique abilities.
The ability to pick different generals is awesome; each general gets certain privledges along with special units.  There are 3 generals for each army that you can choose, and each requires a completely different strategy for success.  While each general has access to certain unique weapons, they also in most cases have restrictions on some vehicles, including the arsenal they can choose from and how much each vehicle costs.  The general-specific weapons are very cool as well; they include a souped up Aurora bomber that drops fuel bombs (my Fave), EMP patriot missles, the Emperor Overlord tank (has a scary amount of firepower), a ""nuclear"" mig upgrade, the classic C&C lazer turret, a carpet bombing general ability, and a nasty little chinese mini gunner (very effective in large numbers).  There also are several units that have been added to each army regardless of which general you choose. I've found that using different generals can drastically change gameplay and adds quite a bit of replayability to the game.
I highly recommend picking this up if you're a C&C nut (like I am).  It's not too pricy and has pretty good replayability.  If you play C&C multiplayer online or through LAN's, then this X-pack is definetely right up your alley.",positive

The new element is you are no longer fettered to buttons to execute your force powers. You actually utilize the Wii-Mote and Nunchuck to perform each given action. At first it seems a bit foreign but if you are an avid Wii gamer it becomes almost second nature. With a press of a button and flick of the wrist you can launch enemies across the screen. It is a great feeling to feel you are wielding the Force. If you've not yet played this game and you dig Star Wars lore...give this game a try,neutral

2741,"I've been playing this game over the past couple of weeks, and I am hooked. I thought that, at first, with the Japanese-style graphics that I might not get into it. The fact that a child is the protagonist as well also put me off a bit. However the price brought me in, and once I started playing it, I was hooked. In this game you play Opoona, a child who crash lands on the planet Landroll. While waiting for his parents to recover (they were originally going on vacation) Opoona becomes a Ranger. In the initial stages, you are given small jobs to complete, most of which allow you to become familiar with your surroundings, introduce you to several NPCs which you become friends with (integral for later in the game), allow you to become more familiar with the back story and Landrollian history itself. Eventually you increase in rank and your range in the world of Landroll extends. The big draw to this game is the combat system. Opoona has a ""bon bon"" which he ""throws"" in combat. Using on the nunchuck, you can determine the speed and trajectory of the bon bon. You can curve the bon bon around some enemies (to get to others), and apply different attributes to the bon bon as well to assist you in combat. During combat you can also eat/drink healing materials (mostly mineral water and popcorn), and use the ""force"" (sort of like casting spells). Combat is done real time, so it takes a bit of practice to master, but once you do, you'll enjoy every minute of it. The game can be played entirely with the nunchuck (though I prefer the WiiMote's D-pad to help select enemy order in fighting, as well as to adjust the camera view), which is an interesting concept, and makes game play very manageable and enjoyable. Overall, this RPG surprised me greatly. I was brought in by the price, but remained due to the game play. The story is interesting, the graphics are very good, and the combat system is novel and enjoyable. I highly recommend this game, especially for RPG fans.",positive
2742,"I agree with other reviewers that the game was fairly quickly played through. My 10 year old son completed it in two days.

Games for children in this age range are more easily completed than the games meant for teens and adults.

My son was easily able to pick up and play the game without any learning curve. Controller commands were easy for him to figure out and he was playing the game with in minutes of unwrapping it. Clips of the show play at the beginning and through out game play, which gives kids the feeling of playing an actual cartoon episode.

Very colorful, graphics are nice and music is spot on with the show. After my son completed the game, he listened to the shows songs that played on the game over and over again.

Game difficulty: Moderately Easy
Graphics: 7+
Story line: 8
Music: 10
Fun: 9+ (For a Phineas and Ferb fan. My son is a huge Lego fan and a Phineas and Ferb fan and when asked which of the Wii games he enjoyed more, he replied the Phineas and Ferb game was more fun)

2746,"Title:  Assassin's Creed Revelations
System:  PS3 (also available on XBOX 360 & PC)
Style:  1-Player Action (8-Player Online)
Developer:  Ubisoft Montreal
Publisher:  Ubisoft
Rated:  M (Mature 17+)

Assassin's Creed Revelations reveals previous unknowns about Desmond, Altair and Ezio in a story-driven action-packed adventure that brings to satisfying conclusion the stories of Altair and Ezio.

The opening video offers insight to Desmond, Altair and Ezio's past to briefly recap what has happened in the previous games.  This acts as a reminder to those that have played the previous games and an introduction to those who have not.

Revelations has playable sequences for all three characters, but the main story still revolves around Ezio.  Since joining the Assassin's as a young man, Ezio has matured and become even more deadly and is now the mentor and leader of the entire assassin order.

Ezio's quest has taken him to Constantinople where a power struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the Byzantines threaten the very things he has journeyed there to find.  While here, Ezio's story also involves making the aquaintance of a lovely woman who helps him decipher information to aid in his quest.  All the while Ezio grows fond of this lady who has started to break down his hardened heart and he once again begins to have feelings of love.

The sequences where you play Altair, the assassin from the first game, depict him from a young man up to a very old man.  These are short, but each one reveals more about his life and adds to the already rich storyline.

Desmond sequences are played out as a surrealistic first-person puzzle platformer.  Each sequence gives more insight to Desmond's past.  These may be skipped entirely, but if you want the most of the story then these are worth playing.

The monetary system allows you to purchase shops and monuments to earn money for items and to invest in certain missions for your recruited assassins.

The citizens you recruit to become assassins can be called to help you in game or sent to other locations to fight Templar ruled areas and earn you money.  You may also assign assassins to a den once you've defeated the Templar captain(s) controlling it.  Once assigned, there are missions to help your newly appointed Den Master on his or her way to becoming a Master Assassin.

There are also factions available, each with their own uses and each has challenges for Ezio to complete so they will become even more useful.

The graphics offer a refined detail that shows off each design in the armor, every stitch in the embroidered clothing, and every stone and grain of wood.  It's a beautiful open-world you will want to explore.

Climbing to rooftops or the top of towers offers astounding viewpoints that will have you looking into the distance just to soak in the surrounding beauty.

The game design is very well done.  You can be running through a rich part of the city where elegant architecture and fancy clothed citizens roam then suddenly you're surrounded by people in rags and decrepit wooden buildings offering a more dreary outlook welcoming you to the slums.

Controls are easy enough to master.  Fight sequences are satisfying with every swipe of your sword or jab with your hidden blade.  Death sequences of your victims are top-notch and depict plenty of graphic violence.

Some missions are time sensitive and there are enemies that are a challenge to defeat.  Fortunately all missions are replayable.

The soundtrack melds with the surroundings in a symbiotic style from light background to intensifying as action escalates.

The manual is in the game's main menu.  There are playable tutorials as well.

New items include a hook blade that aids in combat, climbing and zip-lining about the city.  A bomb-craft system permits creation of lethal, tactical and diversionary devices to help Ezio kill, confuse or distract his enemies.

Rather than having multiple difficulty settings, the difficulty increases as you progress in the game.  Missions may become more difficult to achieve and enemies become stronger and more of a challenge.

There are some negatives.  The Den Defense strategy mini-game puts you on a rooftop to command assassins to attack oncoming Templar invaders.  This sequence seems out of place.  The Den Defense should have simply allowed fighting as normal game play rather than making it a mini-game that doesn't really fit into the game structure.

There are also times when the camera angle is not under player control and this can make platforming difficult at times.  The Den Defense is avoidable, however the camera angle issue is not.

The country-side exploring is also missing from Revelations.

Even though there are a few negative aspects it's a pittance compared to all the goodness in this game.

The main story can be completed in about ten hours, but if you play side quests, challenges and assassin quests you'll have many more hours of enjoyment.  If you like treasure hunting you can add even more time to your adventure.

Revelations does a good job with graphics, gameplay and story and sets things up nicely for Assassin's Creed 3.  Even though sequences can be replayed, starting a new game from scratch is always fun.  I appreciated the game even more on my second play-through.

I highly recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations, especially if you've played the other Assassin's Creed games.",positive
2747,"TNA Impact is a wrestling game that has arcade style action with easy to play controls makes this game really fun. I have been waiting to get this game for half a year and this game is great when it comes to the detail of the wrestlers and great story mode. I am a fan of the Smackdown games since the beginning of the series,but the games don't change enough for how much they charge. This game has awesome controls,they made the moves easy to do and the moves look realistic.

This game has a great story mode,you start out as Suicide,a masked wrestler who gets jumped by wrestlers who give him a beat down,he is covered in bandages and then you create your own character. The character works himself up from Mexico to a TNA wrestler. The story mode is not serious it's suppose to be chessy. This game took two years to make because they scanned the wrestlers and moves,so this game looks really good,it uses the same the same game engine as Unreal Tournament 3/Gears of War.

TNA Impact has 25 wrestlers to pick from or you can make your own wrestlers,it's a good creating mode,but it's not really that deep. I like the Ultimate X match it's great concept,but it is hard to win because you have to press the A button about three times when the meter swings in the middle. Their is not really many types of matches:tag team,Ultimate X,single,and submission,it's still fun to play. The only two things I didn't like about this game is that the opponents reverses alot and their isn't any TNA knockouts.

Pros: arcade style wrestling,finisher moves,easy to use controls,great graphics,good creating mode,enjoyable story mode

Cons: not enough matches,opponents reverse too much,no TNA knockouts",positive
2748,"Body/Build/Feel: 5/5
Sensor: 5/5
Accuracy: 5/5
Weight: 5/5
Scrollwheel: 4/5
Rubber Grips: 4/5
Side Buttons: 4/5
Buttons: 3/5
Mousefeet: 1/5

Basically, the overall build quality of the mouse is amazing and the texture is nice; it's not quite smooth, as it looks in the pictures (of course) and has somewhat of a bumpy feel. The side buttons have a smooth texture on them and isn't quite something I like, mainly next to the ""bumpy"" texture of the mouse, which is quite grippy. They're very clicky and take a fair bit of extra pressure to activate. The sensor has never started to be glitchy, and is generally very accurate. I play CSGO and I had SMFC and had played a couple of matches against professionals without doing too shabby and can say with certainty that this mouse definitely has the accuracy to hold up against the precision of a professional player (not claiming I am near the level). The scrollwheel is kind of poor, to be honest, as both my and a friend's scrollwheel have started to break in one way or another, mine being that it started dragging and his being that it was harder to move backwards than forwards. The button on the scrollwheel is okay, I haven't had many problems, but it feels a tiny bit too mushy and doesn't give much feedback, and clicking it sometimes results in scrolling the scrollwheel because it takes a bit too much pressure to activate it or the scrollwheel takes too little pressure to scroll, I'm not quite sure which in all honesty. The weight is perfect for it to be easily repositioned and for it to not be lifted in the middle of flicking the mouse or something of the like. The rubber grips would undoubtedly be better if they didn't accumulate so much sweat- I sweat more than normal in my fingertips but even my friend has some problems with this- if they were a different grippy material or they were perforated or something of the sort they would be perfect (this goes for the rubber on the scrollwheel as well). The buttons are rather shabby because they really do activate as easily as everyone says, and I have in fact knifed many teammates in spawn because of it, or prematurely fired a shot. It definitely happens a lot less since I started using it due getting used to it, but it does still happen. Last but not least; the mousefeet. They're a major turnoff after using this mouse. For a new mouse after wearing this one out (which was about a year and a half) I considered buying a new one but I realized a major reason why this mouse felt very... grainy while using it is because the mousefeet wore out. They're small mousefeet and barely cover much area, and if you get a scratch on the bottom of your death adder they're going to scratch along your mousepad as well, if it even sticks off in the slightest bit, because the mousefeet barely elevate the mouse from the mousepad, if at all. They were really glidey upon first purchasing the mouse but after a year they really don't feel the same, I've tried it on new mousepads, and my friend got a new mousepad and mouse, being the Logitech G700 and Corsair MM300 (not the glidiest mousepad, but still pretty glidey) and his mouse glided MUCH further than mine, mine being about half an inch and his being about 2-3 inches. Anyways, point of this being that the mouse overall is really good, but the mouse buttons need to be a little harder to press, and the mousefeet need to be larger and a bit better, as well as the scroll wheel and side buttons needing some tweaking as well.

TL;DR good product, the mouse buttons are a bit too easy to press, scroll wheel isn't the best, side buttons are a little too hard to press and are a bit too clicky, and it really needs different mousefeet. Good for maybe about a year, is worth the price otherwise; maybe I only say about a year due to the mousefeet, so maybe replacing the mousefeet every now and then is all you need.",positive

2750,"Little known uber cult classic among Dreamcast enthusiast. This game is made from the same company/creator behind Blue Stinger. Blue Stinger actually sold pretty well. Sega had asked Shinya Nishigaki to work on Blue Stinger part 2. Instead he decided to work on this. As the game was nearing completion Sega had backed out of publishing this. Mr. Nishigaki struggled to find a publisher.  Ultimately he went with a offshoot of Jaleco. Unforuntately at the same time Sega decided to quit the console biz. Ironically one of your goals is not to die of a hear attack. Unfortunately a few years later the creator died of the very same thing. If you don't have patience this game isn't for you. The game is hard and is a bit awkward. However, this is a very unique game. This is a very bizarre game. Im not going to lie and tell you is execution is good. It isn't and you will be frustrated often. If you can stay the course you will find yourself in a very unique and different experience. Graphically wise it is average. Your goal is not to be scared to death. There are many traps and enemies. You can just run through this game. You have tools in your disposal to avoid this.

It's about a 10 hour game, but it leaves the ending opened for a sequel, which I hope will come soon!!! Some of the puzzles (mostly logic puzzles) are really hard. Some are just tricky wording. But the story is very in-depth, great little cut-scenes and characters. Not terribly predictable, though I figured out some things early on, you do get hit with a curveball or two.

It's my understanding that only the special character's, like Nook, Isabelle, etc., need the amiibo cards if you desire to decorate their homes.  I have purchased a lot of the amiibo cards, but have not felt the need to use one with the game yet.  I guess I just don't care enough to use the cards, maybe later.  We haven't even played the game in a few days.

The Animal Crossing amiibo cards really are cute. My daughter decided she'd like to collect the set.  This has proven to be more of a challenge than I realized.  I refuse to pay more than retail for an expensive game add on.  I would have liked the option to purchase the complete set as a whole.

The last 6-card set I bought only had one card that wasn't a duplicate.  I already regret getting caught up it the collecting.  I've spent enough money already.  After purchasing 21 sets so far from various stores, I'm about to call it quits.  At least I haven't paid more than retail for them.  Just be patient, it's not like they won't be restocked.",neutral
2756,"First, and foremost, there is NO auto save or obvious save feature on this game- in order to save your farm, you HAVE to press the ""+"" button and choose save. My daughter lost three hours work and her entire farm assuming that this game had autosave (like most games) so don't make the same mistake!

Here's the general review: We were lucky enough to get a Wii U shortly after Thanksgiving, but after a week or so of playing nothing but Nintendo Land (and my seven year old daughter mastering all those games and begging us to play with her) I wanted to get a game that she could play on her own that also took advantage of the Wii U capabilities. I managed to catch ""Funky Barn"" when the price was much lower (29) so I decided to go ahead and order it.

So far, she loves it. She's played for a few hours and is steadily building her farm. It's sort of like a mix of Farmville and Sim City- and as your farm grows and your animals grow, they need more and more from you.

Don't get me wrong- this is not the game that will show you how amazing your Wii U's capabilities are. It's basically a DS game that's been quickly ported to the Wii U, and the majority of game play is the same on the Wii U touchpad as it is on the TV screen. But my daughter really feels like it's something great since she's using the touchpad constantly with the game and she's seeing the ""fruits of her labor"" (no pun intended) on the TV screen.

I would never pay $50 for this game. But for 30 or so, I think it's worth it- especially now, when the Wii U is brand new, there aren't very many lower price games for it, *we* don't have many games for it, and it's a good game for solo play for kids or anyone who likes simulation games. It's actually very cute, and easy to master, but challenging enough that my husband has started collaborating very intensely on the layout of the farm.

If you can get it at a lower price point, I would highly recommend it.",positive
2757,"This pad is a really great pad, I had it since April 22 and it still works fine. When I first bought it I can move around a bit smoother. The box says it has plastic inserts in the pad itself, it was true and I liked this a lot because most arcades and metal pads have recessed buttons and I hated that.

  Well the pros are that the sensors are a bit larger and have plastic inserts. The buttons are higher, or the center is lowered. When I got the pad it says that it has an Xbox , PS2/1 and USB plug, but when I got it, it also had a game cube/Wii plug as well. I didn't have one but it was nice to have.

  The cons are it still slips around and still slightly laggy, but not as much as the soft pads.

Its a better pad and i got it for around 70 dollars.

 It was fun while it lasted but the pad finally failed. The down arrow officially doesn't work any more. I won't be playing for a while but I think I can get a Future Max Ignition 2.5 or 3.",positive

Although you can download games to the virtual console portion of the Wii using a credit card, you can also choose to purchase a prepaid points card, which you could use instead. It is simple, convient and secure to use for those who are too afraid of using a credit card for buying things off the internet. I definitely recommend this for anybody who wants and owns the Wii.

2762,"With the Nyko wireless nunchuk solutions the only downside is the Nunchuk can't be cradled into something else like the standard nunchuk.

For example the wii zapper has spot for Nunchuk. This wireless one won't fit in there because it doesn't have the holes where the little hooks go. It has a battery cover there instead.

Another short-coming on this one is that it is a little too easy to get the battery cover off.

Other than that it is a very nice wireless alternative to the standard nunchuk. The response times are similar if not exact to the wired (I can't tell any difference).",positive
2763,"I bought this game used in August 2000. Now you can buy it new for half the price I paid. Figures. Oh, well. To start the review, I must mention that this is NOT a racing game. It's actually a mix between an action game and a driving simulation. But that's what makes the game so fun. Thanks to Sega, you can now take a job you would probably hate, and at the same time, have the time of your life. The object of the game, obviously by the title, is to pick up passengers and take them to their destinations on time. Sounds easy right? Well, not exactly. At the same time, you've got traffic with cars just waiting to get in your way, huge cities that are pretty easy to get lost in (assuming that you have the code to turn off the help arrows), and a fare clock that keeps ticking away no matter how much you beg it to stop. Leave it to Sega to take the most aggrivating job in the world, and make it seem like paradise.
Graphically, there is a lot to like in this game. The cities are modeled beautifully, including pedestrians that jump from in front of your car just at the last second. The game also sports a smooth frame rate of 60 fps.(Except in certain parts when a ton of action is on the screen, then it drops drastically. But right afterward, it shoots back up to full speed.)
The sound is also top-notch, with music by The Offspring and Bad Religion. In my opinion, the song All I Want, by The Offspring, fits the tone of the game perfectly. The sound effects are cool as well, as customers yell at you to pick them up, and then complain that you're driving too slow. But sometimes their language gets out of hand. Sorta. Therefore, the game has a Teen rating.
Overall, if you're looking for a game with loads of fast-paced action and excitement, and also one that lets you be a real-world cabbie, without having to break your bank, then you needn't look much further than Crazy Taxi. It's one of the wildest rides you'll ever take.",neutral

2767,"I was fairly excited about this release.  I tore the box open this week, ready and willing to relive hours upon hours of my wasted youth.  I squeed with delight as the Dragon Quest theme began playing in all its tinny regal splendor.  And then the game began.

Let me say, first and foremost, that I did enjoy playing Dragon Quest IV.  Arte Piazza, the art directors from Dragon Quest VII, took the lead on this remake, and it shows. The refresh on the art is welcome, but not intrusive or overdone.  Akira Toriyama's monster design is still charming and bright, including the bosses. The sound is a near-perfect translation of the original and still rings true after fifteen years.  The problem is that most of the mechanics are also still the same after fifteen years, and they don't quite stand the test of time.

JRPGs are known for slow-paced combat, and DQ is the grandaddy of them all.  Twelve year-old me had no problem with this, probably because I didn't know anything else.  DQIV is turn-based, and forces you to go through several menus to choose exactly what everyone wants to do, every time.  Unlike the recent re-release of Final Fantasy IV, there is no Auto-Attack option.  This means is that early fights can take forever as you whittle down slime after slime.

Inventory is annoying.  When I didn't know that only being able to hold eight items per person (plus one overflow bag) was an arbitrary difficulty modifier, it didn't bother me. Today, trying to stock up on Medicinal Herbs that don't stack and cannot be used except by the player who is holding them is nearly unforgiveable. This is particularly true in the early stages, when those herbs are your lifeline, and its a long way back to the save point.

Ah, yes, saving. Another ""fun"" DQ innovation. In DQ, you save by ""confessing"" at a church. That's it. No save points in dungeons, no way to port out and port back in, nothing. This means that if you trudged all the way out to some Light forsaken tower and spent two hours grinding through it just to die on the final boss, you are out of luck. Do it all again. This time with feeling. And mana regeneration? Forget it, until you can obtain items that will do restore your juice. So make those spells last. They're the only ones you've got.

Finally, level grinding. I'm a 4-year WoW player, so level grinding is nothing new to me. That being said, years of playing WoW and Final Fantasy games have conditioned me to expect that if I play through a game normally, entering dungeons and facing bosses in sequence as I meet them, I stand at least a fair chance of prevailing. Not so in DQ. Most of the time, if you try to take on a challenge as soon as you encounter it, you're going to die. End of story. Expect to wander around aimlessly looking for fights for at least an extra level, better two, beyond the level you are when you first encounter The Next Big Thing. Oh well, at least you make lots of gold, right? Wrong. Forget being able to get the latest and greatest gear available from each new town, at least at first. DQ is stingy with the money, and dungeons drops are rare. Be prepared to wander.

I knew all of this going into the game, though. I knew that there were things that were going to bug the heck out of me because I've come to expect more from my RPGs since 1992. That's why I still enjoyed DQIV so much.

The storyline is still fairly epic, even by today's standards. The characters have life, and feeling, and the localization teams have done their best to make each Chapter feel like it takes place in a completely different part of the game world. Even if this does lead to some horribly funny Japanese-to-Russianesque-to-Rusjapenglish in Chapter 2, it gives you the feeling that you are a large world with varied ethnicities and real danger.

My favorite Chapter is still 3, the tale of Mara and Nara, the dancer and the fortuneteller.  As a kid, these ladies inspired me even more than warrior princess Alena.  That part hasn't changed a bit.  Fighting with clubs and daggers is de rigeur, but using fans, claws and cards as weapons is a blast.  Grinding through the merchant quest still sucks, though.

I also have to give credit where credit is due.  What little new stuff there is here really works. The DS two-screen approach offers a lot of screen real estate for this game.  This is invaluable in dungeons because it lets you get a better sense of where you are going, and cuts down on the random lost roaming of the original.  The towns look lovely, almost on par with Dragon Quest VII.  There is an online Chance Encounter mode that allows you to expand your own town through Nintendo WiFi play.  If you have other nostalgia-starved friends who pick this title up, you'll enjoy sharing your own little piece of Heaven with them.

All in all, I think Arte Piazza did a good job updating this classic for the modern era. I hope this brings a new generation of proto-geeks to DQ, and to the appreciation of substance over style (I'm looking at you, Final Fantasy X-2). I'm looking forward to the ports of Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride and Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie, the second and third titles in the so-called ""Zenithia trilogy"". Most Americans (including me) have never had the chance to play DQV and VI. DQV was released in Japan in July, so hopefully the U.S. release isn't far behind. Maybe they'll even evolve out some of the rough parts this time.

2770,"Battlefield has continued to improve, and I think it is worth buying. I have read some reviews complaining about some of the same stuff including the glitches in graphics, the problems in the multiplayer, and a short/boring campaign. I have to disagree about the campaign. The campaign has good plot and is exciting to play. It keeps you engaged and interested in what happens next just like a serial keeps you hooked. As for the length, it was just a touch short. They probably could've extended the game by another 2 hours if they extended the end instead leaving everything so open-ended. Like always, guns in this game are as realistic as it gets, and that is a big plus for Battlefield every year. The way you shoot, the recoil, the size, the specs, all are more realistic than any game I ever played. In the campaign, there is some war in the sea (about 10 minutes driving a boat, shooting at people), but there is NONE in the air. I was hoping to fly a helicopter or jet, but no missions had it. We all know that flying is a big part of Battlefield, so why not put at least half an hour of campaign that involves flying? The real problem with the campaign were all the glitches. Your character can stay in stealth if you are hiding in certain areas, but your squad will go out in the middle of everything talking like they are at a concert without getting detected. The graphics will also get a little glitchy, probably because the game is optimized for Xbox One and PS4. It only happens a few times, so personally I just ignore it. The multiplayer on the other hand is SUPERB! Graphics, sound, maps, FUN!!! We all know Battlefield 3 had great graphics, these are even better! The texture, lighting, and detail has been enhanced. I have been playing online for quite a while now (about 15 hours) and I think it is even better than BF3, and definitely better than MW3 (Notice I did not say Call of Duty Ghosts considering I have not played it yet). Driving and flying the vehicles takes a little getting use to, but after a few hours you will get used it just like any game. Jet ski's are hard to control and once it gets close to shore, there is no getting the boat off the shore. They should make an option where you can push the boat into the water as long as it is realistic. Can't be pushing a huge fighter ship, that would be stupid. There are new game modes that follow the ideas that COD has. Obliteration is like demolition; defuse is like Search & Destroy; and we all know domination. Although I am more of a conquest kind of guy, these are good additions to people who would like to experience more from Battlefield. An awesome new feature is the ability to be a commander of the team, giving you cool abilities like assigning jobs to players and sending in airstrikes. The multiplayer has really gotten improved all around. Everything is destructible, except for rocks, which makes the game very action packed and can change the map greatly. You now have the addition of water warfare which has made the game that much more fun. There are some problems currently with the servers, but it is not as bad as what GTA went through. The problems with the multiplayer will quickly be updated and fixed, be patient. Overall, the multiplayer is addictive just how BF3 was and it will keep you hooked for a year or so.

Should you buy this game? Make sure you have at least 5GB free space (Just to be on the safe side), and you got to love big warfare with vehicles and realistic shooting (makes it harder than COD). Don't blatantly buy this game not knowing what you are getting and then trash talking it in a review. Hope you take this review into consideration, enjoy playing BF4!!!

UPDATE: Some extra things I noticed after playing a few more hours

-Unlike in BF3, you can now counter someone knifing you in certain situations.
-There are awesome maps where it is all water warfare and the whether changes halfway through making it difficult to drive and effects the shooting.
-Battlelog allows you to join servers, change loadouts, and check stats from your phone or laptop.
-You get points for any damage done to vehicles, no need to destroy it to get points.
-Parachuting looks more realistic

I will update as I continue to play on.",positive

2777,"I'll skip the history lesson and get straight to the point.

If you're looking for more Legend of Zelda, this is it.  Don't be turned off by the cel-shaded visuals.  In fact, I think they add a little extra personality to the game.  However, if you're still annoyed, just wait for the next one, of which there are already some screenshots of showing off a more realistic visual style.

Anyway, like I said, the cel-shading adds some extra personality to the game.  There are several emotions that can be shown on the characters (Link included), and in fact suit the more story oriented direction of the game.  Oh, there's still a lot of gameplay, but from start to finish they added some extra stuff that will appeal to Zelda fans.  In fact, I can't think of a single Zelda fan that wouldn't like the final showdown between Link and Ganon (yep... he's back).  The environmental visuals are also worth mentioning.  The world is so much more vibrant than Ocarina of Time (the Zelda game on the N64).  That says a lot, considering how incredible Ocarina of Time looked back then in the environmental effects department.

Sound wise, this is standard Zelda fare.  However, it's worth mentioning that this game does well in the technical department here.  One great touch is how they add a little extra strength to the battles by using sound and music.  Not only that, tensity in general is aided by just minor touches added in the audio department.

Now the gameplay.  One of the best things in this game is the fights.  The targeting system from Ocarina of Time is back, but along with it they've slightly spruced up how battles work.  First off, the different ways to take out an enemy has increased a little bit.  You can pick up enemy weapons from defeated foes, though only keep them for that area.  While not entirely significant, it's a nice touch that makes the fights more dynamic and fun.  Secondly, the enemies block better... or at least the ones that are capable of it.  Going up against some of the armored baddies and moblins is quite fun.  A full room of them is just an absolute blast (as well as challenging), and there are a few places in the games that are packed with these enemies.  Also, the game has added a new option called ""parry.""  It's actually better than it sounds.  Basically, if certain enemies get into a certain attack position, there's an audio and visual cue that says you can perform a parry attack.  If you press it soon enough, not only will you dodge their attack, but then Link will do a cool attack on the enemy that's usually does quite a bit of damage, or breaks an enemy's defense.

There is one big flaw that would likely keep me from playing this again.  The ocean.  The world of Wind Waker is separated into little islands.  To get to these, you have to sail on a boat (a talking boat that actually gives you hints throughout the game) and go from one island to the next.  This can be a problem, because there's quite a bit of traveling to be done, and there's also quite a bit of time consumed in travel.  On top of that, one part of the game actually requires you to go on sort of a ""scavenger hunt"" to find some items necessary for completing the game.  This is the only reason I give the game 4 stars instead of 5 (it's pretty prevalent, too, and non-avoidable).

At the very least, anyone who has a Gamecube should play through this game once.  If you can get past the traveling element, you will find a beautiful, rich, and engaging world in Wind Waker.  If you can't, then at the very least rent it.  The world of this game is more fully realized than ever.",negative
2778,"First, a word on the previous two installments in the modern Fallout era: Fallout 3 and New Vegas. I enjoyed the quests and gameplay of NV over FO3, but I like the Capital Wasteland envrionment of FO3 better. The bombed out buildings and underground warrens felt more post-apocalytpic than the endless desert of the Mojave (I did LOVE the environment of the Honest Hearts DLC, though). I played both games multiple times, and at least once each completely unmodded (a real challenge on New Vegas, due to all the bugs; it wasn't until my third modded playthrough that I actually got Veronica's quest to work; my first game she got stuck and wouldn't move at all, EVER). Still, I played the heck out of both of them, racking up over two hundred hours of play time on each game (over 400 hours on Skyrim, though, between 3 playthroughs).

I'll try to avoid spoilers, though there may be a few (particularly about the opening). I haven't played through the entire game yet, so I can't speak to the ending. I do know you can continue playing after the ending, however, so it can't possibly as bad as the original ending to FO3.

Fallout 4, the latest entry in the post-apocalyptic RPG series by Bethesda, starts off suitably bleak with you the Sole Survivor of Vault 111. Technically, that's not true; you start off in 2077 before the war, and get to see a slice of life in the final days as you and your spouse plan your day with your infant offspring. The war comes to Boston and as fiery mushrooms sprout on the horizon, you race to Vault 111. Fade to black and when you come to, you are the Sole Survivor... sort of; your infant survives, too, and is kidnapped before you can free yourself from the cryogenic tube in which you've spent the last 200 years. Yes, Vault-Tec is back to its morally questionable antics with non-consensual experiments on its residents.

Thus begins the Main Quest: GIVE ME BACK MY SON! (Confession: I made a male character, so I don't know if your child is a girl if you choose a female protagonist). It would be appropriate to make your character look like either Mel Gibson or Liam Neeson, and the robust character creator (which is similar, yet more detailed than Elder Scrolls Online's character creator) allows creative and patient players to do just that. SPECIAL is still there, but skills are gone and you're allowed to put a point into perks at each level (or level up a SPECIAL attribute; your choice). I hear there's no level cap, so there's plenty to go around (in fact, I understand in order to max out at 10 in all attributes and every perk (most, if not all, perks have multiple levels now), you'll have to be over level 220). This makes it really hard to gimp your character by creating an energy weapons guy, then find out there aren't very many at all in the first 1/3rd of the game (New Vegas, I'm looking at you).

That being said, rushing headlong into every fight thinking you can FPS your way to victory is a bad idea. It's easy to get carried away exploring and wander in an area that's far too dangerous for a fresh-out-of-the-Vault dweller. Power Armor makes a comeback, though, and with great power comes great responsibility, i.e. the responsibility to make sure you have enough fusion cores, because power armor actually uses power this time around. It's also customizable if you've scavenged the right materials, so you can pimp it out and make it your own. Weapons and armor come in different flavors now, so they can be found with special qualities, similar to the weapons in the Borderlands series. While it's pretty awesome to find a shotgun that fires exploding ammo from a game play perspective, it does take me out of the game a bit, because it just doesn't feel real. That's a minor quibble, though, because you can still mod those weapons and make them more awesome. You can't break them down for scrap, though, so if you don't want a particular legendary weapon, just pawn it off to your companion or sell it.

Fallout 4 is a scavenger's delight and by the same token, the Settlement Building mini-game is an OCD packrat's worst nightmare. You're probably already in the habit of taking everything that isn't nailed down. While you will immediately have a use for it (most things can be scrapped for parts), you can easily spend hours at a time building up your settlements. In theory, you could spend quite a lot of time doing nothing but. Too bad the controls are a little funky, a situation that will be modded on the PC, I'm sure.

Speaking of controls, Bethesda has committed the cardinal sin of screwing with keybinding. Some baffling choices have been hardcoded into the game. For example, melee and grenades are bound to the same key and cannot be separated. Rebinding the movement keys removes your ability to move around in Workshop mode, making building settlements such a huge pain-in-the-butt, that it is no longer something you'll want to spend time on. If you're not a leftie and are comfortable with a controller or the WASD default set up, this won't be a bother. I'm a leftie though, and WASD is very uncomfortable for long periods of time. Breaking the interface when reassigning keys is extremely irritating (ME3 did this, too). I know WHY this is: it's easier to design one control scheme shared across Xbox One, PS4, and PC than it is to design multiple control schemes that play to the strengths of each one. Still, that's no excuse. It sucks, frankly. Fortunately, some Googling showed me how to install a keybind applet that resides in memory and bypasses the game's keybinding so I can set up my preferences without breaking the interface too much (it's NOT a mod for the game, so it doesn't interfere with quests in any fashion). I can't use the workshop menu at all with that script, though. I'm not sure which solution is better. The script is easier to disable when I do want to work on my settlements. I shouldn't have to do that fiddle with these things to have a playable experience, though.

On the plus side, the game is playable. It is, in fact, the most stable Bethesda game I've ever played at launch. I didn't come into Skyrim until several months (at least 6) after launch, so I can't speak to it, but I remember the absolute nightmare FO3 could be (and NV was worse, but that was an Obsidian game built on Bethesda's engine). Of course, WHY game publishers get away with releasing such buggy software could be a whole essay in and of itself, and I won't get into that here.

In addition to the stability, the companions are the most well-rounded of any Bethesda game, to date. They have personalities and quests, and romance options more in depth than Skyrim's ""I see you have an amulet and I like you well enough, let's marry!"" Many of them have quests of their own for you. One in particular is a source of Radiant Quests, ala Skyrim that you'll either love or you'll grow tired of and avoid him (or if you're on a PC, hunt down a mod to turn off his Radiant Quests). Gone is the faction/Karma system of New Vegas, now your companions judge your actions based on their own philosophies and the rest of the world doesn't really care if you steal from the raiders who have been shooting at you.

The skeleton tableaus and subtle back story woven throughout the environment is just as strong here as it has been in past installments. Sometimes, these after-the-fact stories are stronger and more engaging than the actual plot. Someone in the Commonwealth certainly likes setting up their teddy bears in odd positions. I found a couple in flagrante delicato, and another trying to read the paper while doing his business, if you get my meaning. In addition, I understand Bostonians find the geography unsettlingly accurate, if a bit compressed, much like D.C. residents did FO3.

Crafting is pretty robust, even putting the settlement building aside. You don't have to hunt for food recipes, though perks are needed for some of the more advance chems, meds, weapon, and armor mods. In fact, food is pretty awesome, better than stimpacks in many cases. Plus, you get XP for cooking. Save your stimpacks for broken limbs and Dogmeat (if you can stand the whining when he's injured, he'll heal quickly, but it's REALLY realistic and I hate hearing a dog in pain). They didn't include the ability to craft ammo, though. It makes ammo nearly the most valuable resource in the Commonwealth, especially once you have a strong settlement up and running providing you with clean water and food. You can also rename your modded weapons, so you could have a ripper called ""Dr. Teeth"" and a gauss rifle called ""The Electric Mayhem."" My double-barrel shotgun is called ""Nora,"" after my character's wife who was a lawyer before the war. See, she'd give the opposition both barrels in her closing statements, like I do Feral Ghouls, even after I think they're dead (ESPECIALLY if they look dead). I also modded up a flamethrower and called it ""Trogdor the Burninator"" and my scooped rifle is AT&T (reach out and touch someone).

The shooter portion of combat is better than it was in FO3 or NV and VATS is still there when you need assistance (and the annoying, darting giant insects are much easier in VATS). You'll want that assistance when you finally encounter Deathclaws and Super Mutant Suiciders (they give new meaning to the term ""Nuclear Football"").

Bethesda has definitely learned in the years since FO3, and probably have taken cues from other games as well. Fallout 4 is challenging and fun and a worthy addition to the Fallout Universe. There's hundreds of hours of content here and future DLCs will no doubt only serve to strength that. Unfortunately, as much as I praised the companions earlier, some of the interactions with other NPCs is lacking. For example, the first time I encountered a friendly ghoul in the game (which did NOT exist at all for my character just a few days ago), there was no dialog option why this guy was so obviously inhuman; he just just another Bostonian. As I understand it, there are certain friendly ghouls to whom you do have a WTF? reaction the first time you see them, so apparently, I wasn't supposed to encounter this guy before all the others. So, it's possibly an oversight, but it was immersion-breaking.

If you think it's a travesty that the Fallout series has moved beyond turn-based isometric games, then Fallout 4 is not going to change your mind. If you liked FO3 and NV, you will likely enjoy Fallout 4. PC gamers are used to Bethesda's quirks by now and know that a decent game by them can become great with the proper mods. Fallout 4 is already a great game, mod will make it awesome.",neutral

2783,"I loved Dragon Age Origins. To bits. I had hoped that what had made DA:O great would be revisited in the highly anticipated sequel, DA2, but ...not quite. There was much to love about DA2, but not enough to make it great.

The Plot -

* Set in Thedas and the world of Dragon Age Origins. The game takes place in the Free Marches, a place mentioned during DA:O and occurs after the events of DA:O and it's expansion Awakenings. Your choices in those games affect the history and political setting in DA2, but not so much.  You are a refugee fleeing the Blight with your family in the year Dragon 30, while elsewhere in Fereldan the Grey Warden from Origins/Awakenings is busy killing darkspawn and archdemons and making kings. By Dragon 40, your story will have played out in the city-state of Kirkwall, and change the world of Thedas forever.

* The Chantry, the church of Thedas, is in conflict with itself, and grants their Templars the task of protecting, imprisoning, indoctrinating, abducting, controlling or lobotomizing the Mages. Mages in turn are prisoners, lobotomized Tranquils, corrupted demon hosts/bloodmages or heretical sinners fleeing the long arm of the Chantry. It's not easy - the Chantry religion teaches people to fear mages, and mages themselves aren't much help since they often dabble with blood magic or dangerous spirits.

* The Qunari are a people of very strict religious doctrine who, if possible, treat their mages with even more discipline and cruelty, but not much more than they do the people of other religions. A few hundred of them are visiting Kirkwall, and while there have been only a handful of scuffles, the very presence of these unsettling guests is the source of upheaval in the politics of Kirkwall and the Chantry.

* Your Companions. You will collect a team of followers who you assist, and who assist you in turn during the events of the game. Some will be your best buddies, and some will be your respectful rivals. Not all of them will stick with you to the bitter end. Some agree with you, some disagree with you. They disagree with each other, as often as some seem to find common ground. I love the party banter between the companions that gives you a sense of their own relationships and personalities.

* Your character - Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall, and the one thing holding the Hawke/Amell family, the Companions and, eventually, Kirkwall, together. You will also be the one thing that can blow them all apart.

--What's Good --
- The art. Visually beautiful environments (especially with the free high quality texture pack) and outstanding artwork.
- Companions make the game world more believable and anchor you to the experience, adding to the immersion.
- Improved talent trees and level up mechanics
- Love the animations and fight mechanics
- Friend/Rival aspect (although it still felt just like the approval/disapproval of DAO)
- The Grey Wardens and the Deep Roads
- The story
- The writing
- The Voice actors
- Like every other BioWare title I've played, there is high production quality and the game runs reliably and stably with relatively few/minor bugs. It's sad in the gaming industry that this is not always a given, but BioWare does deliver on that.

-- What went Wrong --
I can't fault BioWare their writing - just how it was put into motion.

The game was surprisingly short, placing it somewhere between the length of Dragon Age Origins which can run 40 or so hours and it's expansion Awakening, which is about 20 hours. The main plot needed some extension so you might have more interaction with the politicals of Kirkwall, the Chantry leaders, and the Qunari Arishok. You spend the first year in Kirkwall in the blink of an eye - you join a faction to pay your way in but there is no consequence to one choice over another, and no quests beyond the initial one. You do have a goal to work towards in getting into an expedition that should ensure your position in Kirkwall, so Act 1 at least has a solid goal.  The Qunari are a distant threat that you aren't given a reason to worry about beyond prejudice.

Act 2 is made up mostly of side quests, companion quests and other tasks. Anyone who did not play DAO and Awakenings would not get the gravity of the problem in DA2. There really could have been more quests devoted to filling out the main plot story and options. What happens in these years will change the world of Thedas forever... why not spend some more quest plotting to make you feel the weight of that decision? I think there are all of two quests in Act 1 and 2 concerning Patrice, a major player in the political events. The Qunari explode at the end of act, but you've hardly been given a tie in to know what's going on. As quickly as they have flared up, at the end of Act 2, they have fizzled out. Uhm... Consequences?

Act 3 has at least one major character doing a sharp 180 degree turn from his behavior in Act 2. There is no option to affect the events that will take place because of it. There is no decision here at all to affect the crisis point, or even about how you will react to the events - its no spoiler to say you're gonna fight, and often the same people no matter what you choose. All that changes will be the fate of the character that performs the pivotal act, and what faction you will support in the end.

--What was really annoying--
It's been said before, but can't be repeated too often - which is very fitting considering what the complaint is ... Overused environment maps. Really - the same cave map exists everywhere in Sundermount, but just different passages are blocked off. I had to forever be in the Journal so I could remember what quest I was on - the underground ones most all looked like one of two maps. There are two house floorplans in all of Kirkwall - mansion or hovel, one warehouse, one seedy hideout, one underground passage. They just have different doors open or blocked off depending on which address you've gone to. What's that about, BioWare? It was very confusing.

The companions are fun, but you really wanted to strangle most of them when it came to their personal quests. Choir-boy (Blind and faith really don't go together), Broody Elf (Get on with your life already!), Blondie (You need Help. Capital H. Now.), Daisy (IDIOT!!!), Ravaini (selfish little sociopath), ... even your own brother (jealous for 30 years... get over it!) - all needed a good throttling. Sadly the two sanest companions, Varric and Aveline, were off limits as far as romance subplots went, so you had less interaction with them than your crazier companions. Their in-party, and sometimes in-quest banter was full of win.

Fights - I hated the pop-up thug dispenser that kept adding more enemies to any battle. Aside from feeling like the game was cheating by adding more folks in than were present at the start, it was often bugged. In order to complete some quests I had to exit and re-enter an area repeatedly until the dispenser had squeezed out what was at the bottom of the tube. Aside from the boss battle at the end of Act 2, there are no really wildly fun fights. Sigh. Also - the lack of a fully top down view of the battle field and limited camera distance, was only mildly annoying, but was a definite step back from the series predecessors.

Considering we can expect a flurry of DLC to be released, which will no doubt fill out the game more, the price tag seems less than fair, especially after the $10 price hike for the ""free"" Signature Edition upgrade. The game has made me less likely to pre-order the next title in the series. If you get DA2 expecting the same level of awesome that you got from DA:O or Awakenings, it will be a disappointment.",neutral

Chock full of Final Fantasy VII's original history, this is the best place to start if you've wanted to see what all the fuss was about; and veteran gamers finally get to fill in the blanks that the original game was always poking at!

2788,"Starting back with Battlefield 1942, we play this game for its multiplayer.  Thus far the game has been a little buggy, with some maps crashing after a few hours of gameplay.  Something I'm sure will be sorted out and/or will happen when you play a game for that long.  Everything we've come to love about this game is present and improved.  The game really forces you to play intelligently and with your team.

The reason I docked one star is because of the pitiful single player and the continued use of the browser based launcher.  Yes, this game is all about the multiplayer but these people brought us Battlefield: Bad Company, which I thought was what a single player adventure in this game would be like.  The single player does a poor job of acquainting you with the multiplayer game dynamics and entirely skips over the aircraft for use.  Then with this browser based game interface, you just end up wasting time between games.  This is the only game I have seen do this and it just gets annoying.

Overall, if you love the Battlefield franchise, you will be buying it.  If you want to get into it, you might buy it when it drops in price.",neutral

2790,"Very good controller with just a few minor flaws, some may or may not be the fault of the controller.

Pros: Bluetooth and RF Wifi USB adapter.

This means you can plug in the wireless dongle and enjoy an Xinput controller, or connect it via Bluetooth to an Android or IOS system. I tried unsuccessfully to pair to to a Windows 10 PC through bluetooth, while it pair it showed as a bluetooth keyboard and none of the keys could be set.

Xinput works fine, no lag, and no dead zones (verified with several different programs). That's amazing considering both the official Xbox 360 and XboxOne Controllers have deadzone issues. However, when using my Dolphin emulator, the X Y and B buttons did not respond. They work so far with everything else, just not with Dolphin for some reason.

Paired with Bluetooth to an Nvidia Shield. Worked great. No lag issues that I could determine, which is great for mixing together a bluetooth and RF controller in the hardware.

Controller Build: It is a tad on the light side, but not cheap feeling like a lot of generic Chinese made gamepads. Kind of like the Wii U pro controller in weight, a mid weight, not heavy weight like an XboxOne. The thumbsticks are responsive and center well. The buttons are responsive, and they glow which looks cool. The D pad is a Nintendo style instead of the Playstation kind (thank God). Best thing is the RT and LT triggers are spring type triggers.

Connection quality: Played for a few hours with both the RF and Bluetooth functions and never experienced a disconnect. Unlike the Xbox One wireless adapter, it never disconnected, and connected immediately. The dongle is tiny as well, and marked Gamesir to distinguish it from other dongles.

Cons: Button placement. I would have preferred the START and SELECT buttons be swapped with the Turbo and the Clear, I find myself naturally reach for those two.

Wired Input: Yes, you can play it wired with Xinput if you desire... however the button blink as if they are charging. Still works, but then you have to deal with the buttons constantly blinking as you play. Easier just to stick with the wireless dongle unless need to charge it.

Bluetooth only works in Android: So far as I can tell. I tried but was unable to get it to work with Windows. Why is that a big deal? It's not, really, unless you were playing on a Device like the Microsoft Surface and the one USB port is already being taken up.",negative

2793,"I'm a fan of the Tom Clancy series. The Division is a slight different story but same great RPG shooter action. All the game options are easy to figure out and most of the button layouts too. You can customize your player to be male or female and every skin and hair color too. I was a little worried this was going to be a multi player game where there are players running all over the place. This isn't like that. Its just you when on a mission. The only time I saw any other players was in the safe house.

Gameplay over all is good but I did find that i was getting stuck when in cover and trying to move and run away. There are times where it feels like it moves where it wants on you and you have to wait till its done the move before you can re gain control. The controller layout are good and easy to remember.

The graphics are really good and it all looks really life like with lots of detail. The backgrounds and scenery is really cool also. If you line in NYC you will appreciate all the fine details. Re-spawning is when you get killed but there are sections where you will have to start from the beginning of the mission if its a non re-spawning area and re-kill everyone all over. When it is a re-spawing area, you start right where you left off and with all that you killed so you don't have to do it all over again.

The one thing which I would have liked is to have the option of the difficulty level. I don't want to have to play at the difficulty that the game makes you. I like being able to select it. Other than that, its a fun game with lots to do and explore.",positive
2794,"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a great game.  In the game you'll shoot pirates, run around jumping on platforms, and solve (extremely) simple puzzles.  It has wonderful graphics and gameplay for the most part.  I especially love the cover-based combat system.  My main issue with this game is that it's short.  I've spent about 9 hours on this game, after replaying several levels.

The action is usually pretty intense, and this is helped by your relatively low amount of health.  A couple shots, and you're dead.  You'll be spending about half the time you're fighting hidden behind a wall, and the other half hiding behind other objects.  This action is interrupted by occasional simple ""puzzles"" and platforming.  The platforming is often used to prolong the length of the puzzles, but it's used on its own as well.  The platforming is usually isn't bad, but the puzzles are annoying.  The game put in tons of treasures for you to find, but unless you're really bored, or really, really like looking at digital fictional ancient articacts, you won't bother trying to find them all.

The graphics and audio are amazing.  The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard in a game, and the sound effects are great.  The music good, although most of the time I didn't really notice it.  The water (and water animations) looks extremely realistic, as does just about everything else in the game.  The animations were...  breathtaking.  For example, when you jump onto a platform that's just barely within reach, you'll dangle by one hand for a second before pulling yourself up.  Little details like this really helped me immerse myself in the game.

The story is pretty lame, although it did have its moments.  The dialogue was good, well written and well spoken, but I didn't really care about the characters.  The cutscenes were still enjoyable, though, with the great voice acting and animations.

It has several poorly designed levels; usually the ones that put the heaviest focus on adventuring rather than combat.  The adventuring is usually fairly boring, with you running around one room trying to solve some simple little puzzle.  There are a few levels where you're riding in the water.  This is just another thing to shake things up, but I didn't love it.  Especially in the beginning, where you have to swim up-river.  About 3/4ths of the way through the game, the gameplay will suddenly change drastically from a quick action-based shooter to a slow survival-horror shooter.  I've heard many complaints about this, but I actually liked it; it was a change of pace much like the puzzles, except more interesting.  The boss in the game is ridiculously easy--far easier than many other levels.

It's a great game, though, and definitely worth at least renting.",positive

2797,"At its very core Tropico 5 is a large expansion of the foundations set by Tropico 3 and 4.

Its not something that should put you off, but if you were a critic of earlier titles then there isn't much in the way of change here for you.

For those of you who are either new to the series or an old fan, I cant recommend it enough. Theres still that charming humour behind everything you do. Theres still numerous paths you can choose to solidify your power and theres still a huge amount of ways to build and sustain your city.

Those familiarities may be a problem for veterans of the series, and understandably so. Its undeniably iterative, but for me it does just enough to make it feel like a fresh way to experience Tropico.

2801,"So it does what is says.

Companies are still working on compatibility with the unit.

The Game Eco System is a bit low, since they are still working on making games compatible with its not controller based set up. Xseed and a few companies have said they are working on it.

Sony has said Netflix and Hulu and more are coming later. But Crackle is actually very good hold over till they get the paid stuff going.

You can manually adjust the settings to 1080 if you want. I have it set to auto.

Games look great on my TV, Muramasa Rebirth and Kill zone mercenary and Dragons Crown are great games the look fantastic with this, Muramasa is well worth the purchase alone for me on this, finally no more cramps cause i have a controller.

You can sync a PS4 controller to it. Some games like Silent hill classic are not on the PS TV store or not listed for PS TV use, but if you have a vita or the title in your transaction history or on an existing Vita mem card the game will still play on the vita TV.

If you play normal games on vita online they work as intended. If you want to stream PS4 games its hit or miss esp if its a game with lots of action going on on the screen at once. So it is hit or miss if you use wireless streaming. But you can fix a LOT of this if you use a wired connection. I wired mine up to the router because I had a 25 foot cord I could run to the other TV following the same path as my Cable TV wire. This fixed a lot of the issues. when Family wants to use the TV I have used the PS TV. Though Intense games with lots of on screen action will have issues.

For someone like me with a large PSP and PSone library on the PSN network this is a great tool for having on a TV. I used to US a PSPgo with a PS3 controller to do the same thing. But this does look a lot better and looks much cleaner over HDMI.

So far I have gotten the 140 bucks for the bundle set worth out of this in entertainment value.

Its got pros and cons, but it will be more worth it as time goes on and Sony rolls out more features for it.

If after what I said it appeals to you. Pick this up. I think its a good add on to the PS4 and good on its own as well.

Bundle was a good Buy, you get a mem card, game, and controller for an extra 40 bucks. Well worth it.",positive

2803,"Whenever a dog-fighting sim comes to mind I always have to think back to the old days on the Nintendo 8-bit when I first tried out ""Top Gun"". I was a force to be reckoned with...at least for the first level. I made my way through all those bogeys with ease, and then I was given the order to land. Beads of sweat rolled down my face, a lump grew in my throat...and you can bet a steak dinner I nose dived my multi-million dollar F-14 into the carrier, again and again. Sure it may be a fossil of a game by now but I always had to applaud it for adding that extra depth of realism by requiring landings, even though I sucked at it.

  I must admit I never got a chance to try the very popular Ace Combat 2; I instead tried the obsolete Air Combat that was bad enough to make me hold back from trying other flight games for Playstation. So when Ace Combat 3 made its way into a used CD store, it didn't take long to find its way it Jobe's sticky fingers. After playing through it now, three times, trying out all of the ships and other modes I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is the best dog fighting game I've ever played. Playing this one makes all others seem like toys in a discount rack, Ace combat 4 is like a dream, this game can't be real.

  Instead of shoving ""no chance in hell levels"" and monstrous mechanical enemies like Air Force Delta, down players throats to try and make an electrifying game during every second. Ace Combat 4 sticks to what it's really about, dog fighting. Sure there are multiple air-to-ground levels, but when you're not putting towers or satellite dishes in your sights, you're probably cranking your plane as sharp as it can turn to avoid one of a missile on your six.

  Flight combat here is, no joke, just as it should be. You take two hits, maybe even one perfect one and its curtains. Just like in real-life piloting, half of your time is going to be dodging missiles from bogeys, who will stick on you like a bum on a bologna sandwich. No enemy can be deemed irrelevant here, it's when you pass that missed SAM site that you'll have immediate missile lock, so kiss targeting any other enemies goodbye, because  you're times going to be spent pulling G-Force blackouts to avoid missiles. Over the course of 18 missions you'll also encounter an elite group of fighters called ""Yellow Squadron"", and going up against these pilots manages to create a tense heat as you fight for a perfect missile lock while avoiding a Yellow already on your tail.

Another point I have to bring into view is the storyline, granted there are no CGI's or movie clips between missions. Instead the story is told through still hand drawn pictures, and is so well written that it makes even some of the RPG's stories look like Creative Writing in Kindergarten. Ace Combat 4's story isn't a crazed general hell-bent on world domination, but in fact a superbly written narrative about the recollections of a young boy during a war who befriends an enigmatic pilot ""Yellow 13"" who strives during the war to find a worthy opponent, and you are that opponent he speaks of during the storyboards. The war is between the Eursian's and the Allies who fight over a devious weapon originally designed to shoot down meteors falling to earth called ""Stone Hedge""

The story not only is a huge and creative departure from your everyday gaming stories, but also adds in a smart commentary on trials and tribulations of those involved in war as well. It also doesn't hurt that the opening moments of the final level is one of the greatest cinema scenes in gaming history, I won't spoil it, but coming from a movie reviewer for over 5 years I can say it even rivals the silver screens moments.

  Ace Combat 4 is one by far this year's biggest sleeper hit. I had no idea of what to expect when I purchased it, and what I found was a dog fighting paradise. Flight simulator fan or not, I still recommend this one highly to all PS2 owners, after playing through it 5 times and already on my sixth I still can't find anything bad about this game, and believe me that truly means that this game is something special. One of 2001's 10 best games, another must have title, right alongside Metal Gear Solid 2 and Grand Theft Auto 3.",neutral
2804,"If you're a Tekken fan and enjoyed 6, Youll like this one. Its basically a no-frills port with great graphics and 3D effects. IT lacks customization features present in the console versions, but I was never a big fan of those anyhow. Otherwise, it's a solid addition to the 3DS' fighting game line-up and online play adds to the replayability.",positive
2805,"Traveller's Tales returns with another Lego-based game, this time focusing on the Indiana Jones franchise after conquering the world of Star Wars.  Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is exactly what the title implies: the original Indy trilogy in Lego form.  It should be noted right now that if you've played any of the Lego Star Wars games, you'll feel right at home here.  The gameplay itself is relatively simple, family friendly fun that nearly anyone can pick up and play.  Co-op mode is where the real fun of Lego Indiana Jones is to be had though, and like Lego Star Wars before it, the game just has a sense of undeniable charm to it that you can't help but get some enjoyment in the very least out of it.  It may not take you too long to breeze through the game though, but if you do, it is worth going back and playing again just to catch all the game's in-jokes and visual gags, along with a horde of hidden items and goodies as well.  If there's any real flaws to the game, it's that the AI isn't all that good in terms of enemies and AI-controlled pals, but as a whole, Lego Indiana Jones is massively enjoyable.  All in all, Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures continues the tradition of wonderfully fun and family friendly games, and is definitely worth picking up for Indy fans or anyone looking for some good clean fun.",positive
2806,"I just finished my first workout with this game and all I can say is WOW! It definitely lives up to the hype. I was sweating more than I have in a while working out, and my heart was pumping. I think my legs are going to be sore tomorrow from all of the squats.

This is definitely better than wii fit for a guided workout with a trainer. Running is 10 times better in this program.

My only complaints are that the leg strap kept sliding off and I would like to see more than one bad with different resistances. I have to figure that out.",positive
2807,"Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is the middle chapter of Ubisoft's new genre-defining trilogy, and is notable for being the installment that upset many fans with its hardcore approach to violence and darker theme. After the events of the first game, the Prince is now being hunted by the minions of time, and must travel to the Island of Time to change his fate.

I personally don't mind the darker approach. Some of the cursing and sexuality seem a bit tacked on, but otherwise the story is compelling (and convoluted) enough that the darker approach makes sense. It helps that the art direction is still stunning, with twisted beasts including giant ogres and a raging griffin. This time the player is allowed to manipulate time to visit environments in the past and present, and Ubisoft did a fantastic job building golden, shining arenas that also turn into crumbling, vine-covered ruins.

Gameplay is also equally refined. The jumping, running, swinging that defined the first game is back, and it's just as fun to get through environments as before. Combat has seen a slight upgrade, as the player now has more control over their swordplay, as well as the ability to deliver some truly satisfying finishing moves. It also helps that Ubisoft cut down on the number of enemies that spawn into an area at a given time, and there's more chances now of skipping combat altogether. It's still not perfect, and is still very annoying at times, but definite improvement has been made.

But the game has one drawback, and that's the amount of backtracking involved during the quest. To be fair, it's not always the backtracking of games like Resident Evil. You reach an area, accomplish a goal, then backtrack out of the area because its built into the story structure. You also go through environments in different time periods, which vary the environmental puzzles and keeps things fresher. However, in the end it still feels like there could've been a bit more variety. And if you want the life upgrades, unlockables, and secret weapons, there's even more backtracking involved. The last quarter of the game ups the difficulty significantly if players don't max out their life bar. And only with all the life upgrades can the game's best ending be achieved.

Overall I enjoyed Warrior Within and found it a worthy installment in the series. A compelling story and fun gameplay win over some repetitive backtracking. If you can accept or look past the game's violence and attempt to be edgy, this one's worth picking up.",positive
2808,"The thing holding a 5-star rating are the controllers - they are IR, not RF - meaning that you must have a good line of site from the controller to the console, exactly like your remote for your TV.  This is bad for another reason - they give you 2 controllers but they can NOT be used at the same time.  Meaning if you want to play sonic and tails as a 2 player game - where you control sonic and someone else controls tails at the same time, then the controllers that come with the system are useless.  You cannot even use 1 wired controller and 1 IR controller at the same time, you need 2 wired controllers to play 2-player games.

Games - there are a lot of games that are not SEGA games, but Streets of Rage 1,2,3 Golden Ax 1, 2, 3, Sonic 1, 2, and some other good classics make it a great deal.  The Games load fast, play like they should (albeit you keep the IR controller pointed at the console), and look like they used to - meaning don't rely on your memories of Streets of Rage being that stunning graphical action game from your childhood - all the defects of 16-bit graphics really stick out on a 60"" HD TV - same thing happened when I plugged in my old Nintendo and Atari - shattered memories!

For the money - this is great - just go buy 2-wired classic controllers and you'll be as happy as a pig in mud.",positive
2809,"I had just played Campfire Legends: the Babysitter, and loved it - this one is just as good, just seemed a bit shorter.

You start off by trying to get the lights back on in the place - meanwhile, boyfriend still hasn't showed up... Great creepy start to get you on edge for the rest of the game. Like The Babysitter game, there is a good mix of logical hidden object parts and puzzles to get you access to different areas. The puzzles seemed a little harder and I had to consult a walk-through a couple of times, but they were fun nonetheless. Of course you might wonder at times why the ""logical"" thing to do is to fix an old decrypting machine or break into a crypt when there is a maniac on the loose that has just jacked up your car- but thats how these games go...There's enough scares to keep you jumping!",positive

2812,"I'm having great fun with this game despite running it on a mediocre system that can't run the game in full graphical flourish. I have a 2.0Ghz P4, 512Mb RAM and an ATI 9800 (the base model, not Pro or XT) card with 128Mb RAM. So it's decent but hardly cutting edge.
Despite the fact that of the eight customizable graphics settings, I have set four to ""medium"" and four to ""low"", the graphics are simply the best I've ever seen, on any game at any time. The sky looks absolutely real, the water has noticeable depth and shimmer, and the foliage is lush and crisp. The character models are great -- muscles bulge, clothing wrinkles, and blood sprays in a most vivid fasion. This game alone makes me want to shell out a few thousand for a bleeding-edge system.
The game play is quite solid first-person shooter fare. There are no huge breakthroughs, though there are nice details like a stamina meter for running and holding your breath. The weapons selection is nice -- enough variety to keep you interested but not so broad that there is much overlap. The voice acting is a model of over-the-top action cheesiness, and the bad guys shout their lines with such enthusiastic machismo that you have to laugh. Fun stuff.
The only gripe I have at this point is weak online play. Much of this is no doubt to my location in Asia, which leads to some horrible ping. But it seems I am not alone in thinking the multiplayer needs a bit of tweaking. I guess there is a patch coming out in June that will hopefully resolve some of these issues.
Bottom line: Top-notch job on graphics and setting inject fresh life into the FPS genre. Well worth it, even if your system has to make compromises.",positive
2813,"This hard pouch is an officially-licensed PS Vita product and works very well, including with the new ""Slim"" or 2000 model.  I'm using it with a Vita Slim which has a silicone skin on it and the case fits like a glove. The case itself is rigid enough to withstand routine transport and usage, but not completely crush-proof.  The interior is padded with soft liner material (including additional padding over the screen). The dual zippers work smoothly.

The interior has no additional pockets or slots for memory or game cards, cables, etc.  That might be a consideration for people who are looking to transport their entire Vita setup, particularly if you have one of the original (1000) Vitas for which there are already a number of full-featured cases.  However, given the scarcity of cases for the new ""Slim"" Vita, this one works very well for that model.",neutral
2814,"Not that far into it, but it stacks fairly well against its predecessor. One problem I have with it is insanely strange pacing in difficulty of boss fights.

Other negative would be some voice acting beefs. i like the new chicks voice, but Lloyd's got a different voice actor. Also, the main character's voice is literally identical to Ichigo's in the English dub for Bleach (same voice actor).

it fits well though.

Overall, good game. Introduces old characters like superstars, but they have level caps and you can't change their gear. They're also temporary so.... Don't expect it to be TOS 1.5. Its a different game in the same universe.",positive
2815,"Shenmue is simply something that every Dreamcast owner HAS to experience.  This is to say that there's no gaurentee he/she will LIKE it....
The game is an RPG-style game with occasional Virtual Fighter-style fights, along with some Dragon's Lair-type button responses.  There's even a few arcade sequences to add flavor.
The story is very well presented- the main character ""Ryo"" is on a quest to avenge his father's death.  Along the way both exciting and mundane events occupy Ryo's time, from fighting rival biker gangs to helping a young girl with her kitty.  The story is rich and by the 3rd disk it may become your life.
A couple words of warning- the game is rather short.  It can be finished in 20 to 25 hours of gameplay.  To me this is a plus, to others it might be a negative.  Also, the voice acted is, for the most part, horrible.  There are moments where the voice performance can be effective, but these moments are few.  This is something the player has to get used to or it will drive them crazy.  Parents note- there is a fair amount of violence (the fighting sequences) and a few 4 letter words towards the end of the adventure.  Final note- the box for this game says ""The Experience Begins..."".  Without giving too much away, those looking for a complete story might be dissapointed.
In spite of this, Shenmue is one of the best gaming experiences I've had all year.  Like a good book, the game lives on beyond the time spent playing it.  I recommend every Dreamcast owner to give it a shot and see if they can make it past the game's shortcomings.",positive
2816,"I've never actually played Tomb Raider, so when I saw that it got a 2013 reboot, I decided that the stellar reviews it got and critical acclaim meant it was worth a try. As an engineer, I tend to over-rate engineering achievements, and I have to say, the game engine underlying this version of Tomb Raider is amazing. The graphics are gorgeous, the controls relatively snappy, and the end result is very pretty. If while playing the game you think to yourself, ""This looks like a million dollars!"", you'd be right, because the budget for Tomb Raider was $100 million. By all accounts, the PC version of the game is the prettiest, especially if you have a strong graphics card to take advantage of it.

What the game designers have chosen to do with the engine is also fairly enjoyable. The game in it's main story line, plays a lot like an Uncharted game. In fact, the first few hours of the game is just as intense as the best of the Uncharted series, with superb writing and great visuals moving the plot along. In fact, the emotional connection the player has with Lara Croft might even be stronger, as she seems more vulnerable than Nathan Drake ever is. And yes, the game passes the Bechdel test, on multiple occasions, not surprising considering that the writer is Rhianna Pratchett.

If the game had continued at this level of intensity through the experience, it would be a better game than any of its competitors. Unfortunately, the game falls apart in the second half of the story. The story isn't to blame. What happened was that the game tries to integrate the experience mechanic of the Batman games, along with the side missions like the optional tombs. If all the side stuff was truly optional, then you could just barrel along and ignore all that, much like the treasure collection in the Uncharted games. Unfortunately, the experience system and weapons upgrade mechanics means that unless you get certain upgrade progressions, the later parts of the game become harder, so you end up scrounging around collecting collectibles for the sake of collectibles.

Now, some of the side missions are fun. The tombs themselves are entertaining puzzles that would take you about 10-15 minutes each. The document discovery stuff is also interesting, since it gives you some back story on the other characters in the game. These pieces fills out the game somewhat, and I have no objection to them. The salvage system, GPS caching, and challenge systems, however, are just silly. They do nothing for the game, forcing you to basically explore the locations thoroughly outside the story, and they dilute the experience severely. Basically, these elements of the game further reinforced for me why the Uncharted games are successful: Naughty Dog studios had the courage to stick to the story that they wanted to tell at the expense of alienating part of the potential audience for their work, while Crystal Dynamics doesn't feel as though they were willing to do so. Ironically, I think eliminating the ancillary systems would have made the overall game quite a bit stronger.

The other thing that broke the flow for me was the way the game let you have a lot of cheap deaths. By this I mean that there are some things that you would never do as a human, but given the limitations of a controller, might result in a death unless the game designers caught it. For instance, if you're standing on a ledge and tip a joystick by accident (or because you're reaching for some other button), Tomb Raider would have Lara fall off the ledge and die. By contrast, every time I've done that in an Uncharted game, Nathan Drake would just grab the edge of the ledge instead, allowing me to recover from an accidental touch. Incidentally, the cheap deaths result in famously gruesome death animations, which are the main reason why I'm not letting my kid touch this game for a while. What's crazy about these death animations is that the one time an NPC dies gruesomely, Lara turns away from the scene. You would think that if you were going for an M rating you might as well do it all the way.

Finally, I wish Crystal Dynamics had spent some of the $100 million budget on giving us a full score for the background music behind the game. There is background music, but it's relatively muted and you only notice it during the cut scenes. It's nothing noteworthy, which made the game feel like it was punching below its weight otherwise. The other place where the game doesn't quite pull it's weight is that Lara Croft is alone all the time. None of the NPCs are helpful outside of the cut scenes, except in a bridge traversal scene, and even then it was obviously scripted. There's essentially no interaction between Lara and the other characters in the game outside of cut scenes.

I just spent several paragraphs complaining about the game. But it was overall, a fun experience and especially in the first half of the game, well written and an intense experience. I'd recommend the game (especially since it has no zombies, unlike some other AAA titles out there), but if you have limited time, try Among Thieves or Arkham Asylum first.",neutral

2824,"There are a ton of DS RPGs out there, I mean ALOT, but this game stands out from all of them. This is the first RPG I've ever played that your cursor (your Wisp in this game) is actually part of the action, and the only real danger of the battles is running out of time, rather than losing HP. Knights in the Nightmare introduces a world of a doomed kingdom, and it's dying king. This is NOT the best RPG start gaming with, it's definitely for those that have played RPGs before, and is rather difficult to explain.

Graphics: As the character sprites go, their pretty simplistic, but it's the effects in this game that keep it brewing with intensity. You'll always see this fog in your battles when switching between LAW and CHAOS (the two fighting dimensions in the game) because the fog affects the battles. Each attack is covered in lighting and spark effects. The character mugshots aren't anything I've never seen before, but the mystery in the game kinda makes you not notice. The nightmare theme and graphics fits extremely well with the game *9/10*

Game-play: I have yet to beat the game, but I haven't yet found it uninteresting. When you start the game, I highly suggest going through at-least the first tutorial section, though because I only did one I had to figure out a lot of stuff on my own. Your Wisp (cursor) is what takes damage in this game, and, like I said above, time is the only disadvantage in this game. Your wisp is what has to avoid enemy attacks, your wisp is what makes your knight units attack, and your wisp is what gives characters weapon's to fend off enemies. You also switch between two dimensions (CHAOS and LAW mentioned earlier) for certain items or if the fog in one dimension is not giving you enough MP. Though it sounds VERY confusing, it's a blast to play, and is always a learning experience. *10/10*

Story: I don't usually judge this one, but if your me, story will sometimes hold a game dead in it's tracks. The story in this game is, like the game-play, hard to explain. I find it hard to keep up with this game's story-line, because it's all in the NPC's (non-playable character's) perspective. Before a battle it introduces cut-scenes of the present, and after the battle, it shows cut-scenes from the past that lead up to the battle you just had, basically explaining your battle. The story is engaging, just hard to pay attention to. *6/10*

Sound: The music sits extremely well with me, a kingdom style surrounded by shadow and horror. Even though the music is a bit goth for me (organ style music in some places) it blends well. Your introduction to battles makes you feel eerie with the enemies before you, while the battle music itself is very action filled. You'll notice some of the cut-scenes will have no music, only to signify lonesomeness in the story. Voice acting surrounds the fighting, attacking, switching from LAW to CHAOS, and whether or not your out of time. But unfortunately the voices are restricted to battles, the cut-scenes rely on text boxes and text entering sounds, so you'll do more reading than listening. Anyway it's a nice game to hear, though a little unoriginal. *7/10*

Knights in the Nightmare provides you with an RPG like no other, in fact it feels a bit like a shoot'em-up game with RPG elements tied in, but overall it's a satisfying package that can rival many of the top RPG's for the hand-held, and pretty lengthy too so far (I have yet to beat it!). But, as I said previously, it's a bit restricted to those familiar with role-playing games already. Final Review: 8/10",negative

2826,"Update 21-may-2014

Still only 4 stars.  Steam turned out to be a good thing over time.  Get games real cheap these days.

As for FNV and all the DLC, the DLC is fun too, more of what you expect.  Some of the areas are pretty hard though.

But my biggest complaint is crashes.  I am running windows 7 64bit.  Not sure that has anything to do with it.  But the game crashes every couple of hours guaranteed.  Given that most sales are done for this game, I wonder if Bethesda will put any time into chasing down these crashes.

I have also decided that my original estimate of game time is too low if you are going to do all the DLC as it adds just as much new game time to the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall the game is excellent.  Here are some highlights:

1) it has multiple endings and you are forced to make choices at some point in the game that takes you down one plot leaf and there is no going back.  You have several factions looking for control and you must choose one eventually.  There are thus at least three different endings to the game (might be more, I have not figured that out yet) and you will likely want to see them all (I do).  This is an excellent example of how game makers have improved upon an already good thing.  One of the complaints of Fallout3 was the ending sucked.  Someone put some thought into this problem and this was the result, you must make choices (cool!).

2) game mechanics are what we expected to see.  In some respects they are better.  For example travel seems easier most of the time because you have an easier time climbing up hills and such.  There are still some places were you can't climb high enough (OK, so go around).  And gone is the unbelievably difficult subway system of Fallout3 that frustrated many users.  It still pays heavily to use the local and world maps but you won't find yourself spending hours trying to locate some remote area.

3) there are 200 to 300 hours of possible gameplay in this one.  Yes you can finish it quick if you want but what is the point of that.  Don't you want to meet all the new characters and see all the diffent places?

4) they have addressed several other issues of gameplay by adding a few new abilities.  As one example, you can now make ammunition and convert ammo between differnt types (at a supply cost of course).  This gives you some control over the availability of rare ammo if you have a favorite gun but can't use it because you don't have the right ammo for it.  However, it again still pays to be proficient in a couple types of weapons and to select the right weapon for the right adversary.

5) most people don't turn instantly hostile if you fail a steal attempt against them so you have a little more leeway to ""appropriate"" necessary plot items when other means fail you.

6) the ""human"" oriented skills play a slightly bigger role in this game.  So if you are looking for a gameplay experience that is not just ""sneak mode head shot = instant death by critical"", then you can feel more confident in investing in those aspects of the game that change dialog options in order to have these options.  Naturally this is all about choosing your game play style so you don't have to do so either.  I must admit however, I have not lost my affinity for the head shot with a laser weapon while crouching from long distance that decapitates somebody, thus letting me watch what the body and what pops off of it, roll all the way down the hill (man I just love NVidia PHYSX).

All in all, I have had as much fun with this one as with Fallout3, and more.

Still, not all is perfect in the wastelands of the Mojave.

1) First, I am still out to lunch regarding Steam.  I can't say I don't like Steam.  Indeed, I think I do.  It gives me another place to go for games and they do in fact have random sales often which are pretty good.  I will likely be picking up a couple of games off Steam because of these sales.  But is pisses me off that when I buy a game, I can only play it if I can connect to the internet.

2) I am running Windows 7.  This games works, but the launcer fails often and I may have to try 20 times or more before I am quick enough to push the Play button before the launcher craps out.  I am not sure this is because of Windows 7 or other bugs.  Do I care though?  In the end it won't play when this happens.  I have recently located the actual executable and created a desktop shortcut with compatability set to XP-SP2.  This seems to mitigate the problem significantly.

3) I have experienced several crashes so make sure you save often.  It is no way like the first release of Fallout3 that STB all the time.  But it still sucks to have played for a while only to have a crash happen and loose it all, and it is quite possible for you to losse a lot since you will be so tied into the game, that you will forget to save.

Overall Obsidian did an excellent job and I can't wait for some DLC (hope they price it fairly (10$ would keep me comming back over and over)).  Now if you will excuse me, I want to try out some new apparel.  Since I picked a female character this time, I have decided to forgo Power Armor as I have decided I much more prefer the view of my character running across the wastes in Naughty-Nightware whilst wielding a scoped Gauss Rifle.

2829,"So it seems that many popular sites are aimed at putting this title down.  Hey after all we all have our agendas right.  I personally think the ratings systems used by popular sites, books, etc are both money based, and biased.  Enough of that though, so I will call it right down the middle.

Pros:

- You can feel the amount of effort and thought that went into this game.
- The world is huge, you will have plenty to do.
- Fighting is rewarding because unlike Arkham you will get hit sometimes like in real life.
- Voice acting, and synchronization are pretty good.
- Music, has a awesome kick to it.
- Side missions are okay, but what puts them above your standard side mission is because it all based in Hong Kong which makes it refreshing.

Cons:

- Cars feel a bit stiff, not bad, but not all that good either.
- Some things will be unclear to you.  The game doesn't have a game manual to explain the unexplained.
- Could have included more things to do in the world, you know things that have never reared it's face in open-world games.  Come on developers INNOVATE for a change.

2830,"I found this to be a fairly entertaining game on my Mac. The graphics during the game are really well done. Some minor glitches although very realistic. The small movie klips in the beginning of chapters are very well done and ensure you get an idea of the history of WW2. The surround sound is quite amazing as if you were on the war path, using head sets really helps the environment of the game. If you are into was games and enjoy first person shooting this game is for you. I played in the hard level and if you are no used to the mouse and keybrd combo get yourself a mouse.

What dissapointed me is that it's not the newer one. I was pretty convinced this was the newer, more compact model. Unfortunately it's not, this one is much less comfortable and much bigger. I will end up dropping another $50 to get the newer one, but at $24 this is a great back up mic.

2837,"For some reason Star Wars and video games don't seem to get along very well. There really haven't been any good Star Wars games on consoles since the SNES Super Star Wars series back in the early 90's (Jedi Outcast for PC notwithstanding). Star Wars Battlefront is looking to rectify that. And it, to all intents and purposes, comes pretty close.

Star Wars Battlefront can be best described as Battlefield: 1942 with a Star Wars mod. You have the basic classes of soldiers from the Star Wars universe; Rebel solider, Pilots, Stormtrooper, Snipers, and even Wookies. All with thier unique weapons and abilities. There are squad commands to a limited extent. Basically you can order who ever is in your close proximity to back you up, hold position or advance. Personally I was looking for a little more deeper command structure, like in the EA game Freedom Fighters. The graphics are very good. Everything has a very Star Wars feel to it.

The controls are somewhat confusing at first. About 2 one hour long  sessions are required to really get used to them. Piloting flyable vehicles is quite difficult. Though the maps are large, it's a constant challenge to NOT crash into anything. The game environments run the gamut of the Star Wars universe. From Yavin to Hoth they're all represented. Some of the game environments are more combat friendly than others. There's lots of open space and at times cover is hard to find. One thing that didn't make it into the game is the player's ability to ""lean out"" from behind cover. This makes things difficult when in the middle of a fire fight. Also the single player campaign could have benefited from more depth. There's Galactic Conquest mode and Historical Campaigns, but there's no real story line and no othe objectives other than ""capture command posts"" which are indicated by beacons of colored light. There's no ""storyline"" to speak of, but footage from the films is used to try and give the action more context. Again, I was expecting more of a Freedom Fighters type of single player with more compelling objectives. But unfortunatley I didn't find it. During Galactic Conquest there are ""Planetery Extras"" you unlock. For example, if you're playing as the Empire you can unlock Darth Vader to fight along side your troops. Sounds cool and to and extent it is. There's also Split Screen action so you can take on a friend or play co-op. One thing that bothered me was that in training mode you are only shown videos of how to do things. The passive training mode did little to help me during the actual gameplay. A more interactive mode would have benefited players more.

With no Network Adaptor I was unable to try the online modes. But after playing the Single Player game, I get the feeling that the online mode isn't much different. Single player feels more like a practice mode for the online games.

Okay now, why did this game get 4 stars? Even with all it's problems, this still is a pretty fun game once you've been playing it for a while. It's also a very good game graphically. One thing I'm hoping is that Pandemic and Lucas Arts will take the foundation that they've laid down for this game and build on it. Giving it a more extensive single player mode and making some things a little more player friendly. There's enormous potential here. They just have to tap into it. Wait till this one is on sale.",neutral
2838,"Visualise this: You are sitting on a boat. German warplanes circle the ground above you. Allied Warships patrol the waters around you. You think you're safe. You think you're going to make it out alive. You think you're going to get back home in one piece, when suddenly an Air To Surface Missile strikes your boat. You plunge into the cold water below. Everything is quiet. You think you are in Heaven. When suddenly you arise from the water with your gun drawn out as if there will be no tomorrow. You have reached your worst nightmare. You have reached Hell on Earth. German soldiers fire at you in all directions. Bullets zoom past you, and penetrate into the sandy beach below. You wish you could do the same, when suddenly your captain yells ""PATTERSON GET OVER HERE"". D-DAY has begun! From dodging Bullets on Omaha Beach, destroying German Bunkers and U-Boats, Sabotaging German Plans and much much more. Have no mercy on the enemy....Tempting enough?
Heck, enough with the documentary now. Lets get to the good and the bad aspects of ""Medal Of Honor Frontline"" for Playstation2. The cover of the game sure does tempt you to buy it. Well, before you end up buying it, the following pointers should serve as a catalyst in helping you make the right decision.
Graphics(7/10):-
There is some improvement, however there is room for a lot more. Sometimes the graphics tend to get blocky at certain instances. Lack of cutscenes tends to make it a bit boring!
Gameplay(8/10):-
Gampley is superb. Richly detailed atmospheres add a pinch of reality to ""Medal Of Honor Frontline"". 20 levels seems to be a bit too short for a 1st person shooter game such as this one. At times some of the levels seem to be never-ending, which tends to frustrate the player. Sometimes Vice Versa is also true!
Sound(8/10):-
Sound effects are rich and the music is also wonderfully composed. The music does tend to raise your morale at certain times, and can be a pain aswell.
Overall(8/10):-
Medal Of Honor is a beautifully rebderd game taking you through an ultimate WW2 experience!",neutral
2839,"Hello all, well ill get a few things out of the way, i like action adventure games with or without the blood is fine by me, i also like shooters and survival horror (just read all my reviews). When i first heard about afrika back when the ps3 was just launching i thought ""wow that sounds dumber than all hell"" and it kinda slipt my mind for along time. One day while trying to get demons souls imported i came upon a deal of buy 3 get free shipping (seeing as how the were coming from asia couldn't pass up) so i got demons souls (fantastic) ratchet and clank quest for booty (on a disc and in english) and Hakuna Matata (afrika). At the time i picked these up the only one definetly coming to the u.s. was ratchet so i figured what the heck if i didn't like afrika id sell it. well this game is not leaving my collection.

the pros are

+graphics are really good
+gameplay is rewarding
+its a relaxing break from violence

the cons are

-no voice whatsoever
-none violent (a monkey ran infront of my jeep and brought me to a dead stop)
-if you don't like animals or photography its not for you.

those are the majors for me but i look at it like this,

sometimes i can only play while kids are sleeping and you don't need the sound for this.
my daughter like to watch me play and she is learning from the info in this game as am i.
again no violence means i can play while they watch.

overall i think its a fantastic experience and while it isn't my most favorite game atm i do put it in regularly to relax and unwind. Usually i go on a safari a day at least.

p.s. patience is a virtue in this game, youll see.",positive
2840,"I am not sure why people are down on this game.  The install was just like any other game and I have not had a single issue.  If you liked BF2 then you will like this game better.  Everything is just a little better (I just wish Karkland was one of the maps).  The unlock system is a lot better ... every few hours of play you will receive an unlock.  The spyware scare is b.s..  It is not spyware and does not send any information to EA or it's partners.  From the research I did, it seems to work similar to the Microsoft update manager.  The ingame ads fit inside the game and are not distracting.  I highly recommend this game.",negative
2841,I really enjoyed it.,positive
2842,"The Far Cry series has always been about creating a vibrant, colorful environment in some far flung exotic locale and filling the world with a plethora of side missions, weapons, vehicles and challenges to advance the (often paper thin) storyline. I've played to completion and thoroughly enjoyed both 'Far Cry 2' (set in Africa) and 'Far Cry 3' (set on a tropical Southeast Asian Island) and with this fourth and most recent entry to the series played on my PS4 I can definitely say that this is the best of the bunch so far.

Truth be told though if you've played FC3 this game basically feels like 'Far Cry 3.5' as the only significant difference from 3 to 4 is the major overhaul in graphics that provides a stunning visuals through and through. Set in the fictitious Himalayan region of Kyrat the color palette really pops out with great variety of geographic terrain ranging from wintery ice and snow to lush and verdant lowlands. Draw distances are impressively ranged and architectural and audio atmospherics richly embrace the influences of Hindi and Buddhist culture. Once you get past the visuals though you'll soon realize that in terms of gameplay and mission structure not much has changed from FC3. You still need to climb towers to unlock portions of the map, you need to take out enemy strongholds to reclaim territory and you'll hunt a variety of wildlife in order to craft various upgrades to your gear. If you were hoping for a completely refreshed and revamped set of gameplay experience sadly you will need to look elsewhere to satisfy that itch but at least for me I'm fine with this derivative experience because I really enjoyed the structure of FC3 and can appreciate the fact that a new title in the series was delivered within the first year of the PS4's release.

Now, as far as 'Far Cry 5' goes I'm fully expecting vast improvements and changes to the gameplay and will be disappointed if it turns out to be another FC3 carbon copy on shinier paper. While FC4's experience is certainly cookie cutter the presentation and execution is flawless with solid controls, impressive audio and visual production and filled with fun things to do in the the game whether you have only 10 minutes to spare or looking to burn a few hours of game time in an afternoon.",positive
2843,"It is a great game. The graphics looks a bit dated, there are some bugs (i.e. character can get stuck, etc) and AI is poor. But none of this matters because it is Fallout.

Sometimes in order to get to a certain areas you need to go through several loading screens.",negative

2846,"After owning the PS4 for a few months now, I have to say that the system itself seems really nice and I like the way the white model looks.  However Destiny sucks, and for a game that cost 500million bucks to make its a joke on any system.  If I had to do it over again, I would have waited to buy a PS4 till a game was out that I wanted and could utilize the power of the system.  Until then, mine will be covered to prevent the dust from collecting on it.",positive
2847,"Let me start out by saying that I raced almost 300 races in the demo and won almost 150, that's a 2:1 ratio. So far in the full version, 45 races, 8 wins.  The ratio is much worse as the game is tougher.  Developers did something to even the racing out a bit more. No more 8 straight wins, your lucky to get 1, and super lucky for 2. I've yet to see anyone win 3 straight. All in all, the game is great and a lot of fun, but also frustrating at time. Like leading the entire race only to lose because the rest of the field picked up lighting bolts which become impossible to navigate. The fact that people don't brake and just smash into you around turns is equally frustrating. A lot of the times the race is determined by the first lap. If your able to get away from the carnage, your ok. If your stuck in the middle or the back, no chance to win since everyone is fighting for 10th place. It's great though have a lot of cars to choose from, although I don't agree with the car classes. Dodge Viper and Ford Focus in B class? Focus should be in C and Viper in B if not A.  If your looking for a fun game to smash around and enjoy with your friends, this is it. It feels great to win because you really have to work your tail off. If your looking for a simulation racer, steer clear. Also if you get frustrated easily, not the game for you.

The Good:
- Tons of licensed cars
- Lots of mods or perks to change the way you play
- Tons of challenges to complete which help you level up
- Tough, this game is not easy to come in 1st every race online
- Power-ups are a blast to use, literally
- Graphics are very good
- Lots of tracks, all are different and have their own feel to them
- Fast paced arcade style racing
- Lots of game modes

The Bad:
- Can be very frustrating at times
- Learning curve although not steep, is not something you can pick up 5 minutes in
- Power-ups tend to get out of control, like 10 cars picking up lighting making it impossible for leader to drive
- Once you fall to the middle or rear of the pack, race is over. Everyone crashes each other for 10th place
- Car classes. How does a Camaro SS have the same rating for speed as a Hummer?
- With all the racing games out there, not sure how long this game will stay around
- Lots of ""BS"" moments
- No lead is ever safe",negative

2849,"Other reviewers have done a good job describing the gameplay, so I'll skip it.  I was skeptical of the game when it released - it looked lame, frankly. But when the price dropped to 1/4th the original retail price I figured I'd take a shot at it.  I'm glad I did. The price was a bargain - a steal.

I'm not generally a fan of hack n' slash gaming, but this was a blast from start to finish.  I didn't care the story was shallow.  I didn't care that the majority of the gameplay is ""go to <location> and clear out the Legion"" - it was a blast.  Hacking one enemy was enjoyable - taking on 5 or 10 at a time was great and literally wading through the vast sea of Legion during the epic siege battles was over-the-top fun.  Kudos for such massive battles and keeping the frame rate solid !! I even enjoyed the stealthy gameplay of searching for skulls in the various cities. Fantastic graphics, solid voice acting & decent music make the game a gem.

Could it have had more? Sure.  Should it have had more?  Yeah, a simple skirmish multiplayer mode would have been awesome... which is why I gave it 4 stars overall.  But what is in the game is pure hack n' slash goodness and I couldn't put it down until I finished, which is fairly rare for me. I immediately played through again on the hard setting and had just as much fun - I even did a few things I missed the first time.  I'm hoping for a sequel, but doubt we'll get one. Sigh.",positive

2851,"The Mortal Kombat series hasn't always had the best track record on the GameBoy system (Mortal Kombat Advance anyone?), but Midway is nearly forgiven with this near excellent GBA port of the latest chapter in the Mortal Kombat saga.  Old favorite characters like Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, and Shang Tsung return to deliver simple one on one fighting mayhem enhanced by the eye popping 3-D graphics and buckets of blood and gore flying around.  The control is simply simple, along with the addition of changing your character's fighting style while fighting is a nice little extra.  As you play though single player mode, you'll collect coins to unlock secret costumes and arenas, plus you can also choose from a survival mode and the two player link option.  Another weird option however is the night vision and psychedelic mode which are so completely absurd that you can't help but try them out.  As I said before the graphics are eye popping and the fighters are superbly animated and move around fluidly, the only complaint about the graphics are the sometimes bland and blocky backgrounds, bu that is instantly forgiveable.  Fighting game fans looking for strategy and depth won't find too much here as opposed to other GBA fighters like Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Tekken Advance, but for what it's worth, Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance is a hell of a fun fighter that GBA owners or fans of the long running series will surely enjoy.",positive

2853,"I just play the campaign aspect of games;

Starhawk is not your typical shooter - some shooting games incorporate sequences where you drive a vehicle or operate a turret for a short period of time, using simple controls.

With Starhawk, operating land and air vehicles take up a good chunk of the game.

In addition to that, there are spots in the game where you build and utilize structures, like defensive walls and automated gun turrets, adding a another layer of strategy to the battles.

With all this going on, the game has a much steeper learning curve than most shooters.

Still, once I got the hang of it, I really had a lot of fun with the some parts of the game, like the air battles.

If all you want to do is 'gun and run', this game is definitely not for you. If you want to do more than just shoot, and you have the time to get used to the controls, then ""Starhawk"" is worth checking out.",positive

2855,"This is one of the first games I received for the Nintendo when I was a child.  I had no idea what Metal Gear was or what the series would become.  I just knew I had a new game and I wanted to play it.  This was my first introduction to the character Solid Snake and his world of infiltration and tactical espionage.
In Metal Gear you play as Solid Snake, a rookie to the Fox Hound branch of the military.  You are to infiltrate a jungle fortress called Outer Heaven and initially rescue Fox Hound members including one of the top operatives: Grey Fox.  While it is always great fun to fight and to shoot the guards, it is more effective to be able to sneak around them (this will be perfected in later Metal Gear games).  Stealth is important.  Shooting with a weapon not equipped with a silencer is a risky move.
As you progress through Outer Heaven you are sent on further missions and must fight ever more difficult bosses (tanks, men with machine guns, etc).  You begin the mission with nothing but your bare hands and a pack of cigarettes.  As you continue to play, you must acquire various weapons and items and use them to progress through the game.  While not as detailed as Metal Gear Solid (PSX), the original Metal Gear is a game worth playing for fans of the series (to get to experience the origins of the story discussed in later games) as well as for fans of classic Nintendo game.",neutral
2856,"I first played the Star Ocean franchise way back when Star Ocean: Second Story was released for the PS2 in the 90's. I had never played the first Star Ocean title. Now, re-released for the PSP, this game has been given a graphics overhaul and some nice anime cutscenes, in hopes of entertaining old fans and introducing new ones to the colorful Star Ocean franchise.

Gameplay

The Star Ocean franchise is known for the deep level of gameplay mechanics that is offered within each game. A plethora of sidequests and character crafting skills can take hours by themselves, and if the gamer has taken the time to acquire enough funds for the characters, you could literally spend hours not even touching the main story. First Departure is no different in this aspect, with crafting skills (playing music, cooking, etc) and side quests galore. However, I cannot shake the feeling that Squaresoft and Tri-Ace took the skin and game engine from the second game and simply slapped the story and characters from the first. The games are very similar.

That is not to say that the game is not fun. The live-action battle system is a refreshing change from the menu-driven battles that litter many RPGs. Sadly, most battles can be won by simply smashing the X button repeatedly. You have the option to set the other characters within your party on auto attack (this is the default setting), and simply choose their attack style from a set of option (go all out, conserve mana, etc). The AI for your teammates is good, and the healer in your party (Millie), is solid and very effective.

In regard to your party, the Star Ocean mechanic of recruiting members is still very strong. As with Second Story, the ability to gain a character for your party varies based upon your actions within the game. And the actions required vary depending upon the character. For example: if you want a certain character, you may have to travel to a certain town at a certain time. Or, maybe you cannot recruit another character. None of these clues are readily obvious, either. Sometimes you stumble upon a character by accident. But more often than not, you will probably need to review a FAQ or strategy guide if you want a specific character for your party.

The frustrating aspects of the game center around the learning curve and the travel times. In most RPGs, there is a steady levelling pace from each point in the story to the next. In this title, you are forced to grind (that is, run around in an area looking for monsters to kill for an unspecified timeframe) for several levels in between each event, or you will wipe. And we are not talking 3 or 4 levels. In some instances, you need 5-10, if not more, to successfully traverse the next dungeon. While a dedicated RPGer will not mind this, to the casual gamer, this may be enough to put down the game for good. Combine this with the sketchy encounter rate, and you can almost consider throwing your PSP in frustration. In one area you may encounter monsters every few steps. In others, you can travel quite a distance before you will have a fight. This lack of a steady encounter mechanic can make the relatively simple task of grinding a chore.

The other frustration, travel time, can be a blessing or a curse, depending on the level of reality you want in your gaming. However, having to spend 5-10 minutes to travel from one destination to the next is annoying. I admit, I have not beaten the game yet, and you may eventually acquire some sort of a vehicle allowing you to travel faster. In the early parts of the game, you run along from one town to the next, spending an indeterminate amount of time before you may reach your destination. If you are looking to do a bit of adventuring on your work break and only have 15 minutes to play before you have to put your PSP on sleep mode, you may spend the bulk of your time travelling, and accomplish little to nothing. For that reason, I recommend setting aside a good amount of time if you want to advance the story.

Story

The story is not exactly epic, but it is interesting and will keep you entertained. The characters all have unique personalities, and the voiceovers are well done. The translation from Japanese to English is top notch, and you will not encounter any odd phrases that make little to no sense. If you are familiar with the second Star Ocean game, this title is the prequel, documenting the adventures of the father of the hero of the second game. In short, an unknown race of aliens are attempting to create a super weapon, and they have released a bioweapon on a planet which turns the people to stone. There is no known cure. The main character, Roddick (which is not the father), must try to save his friend. At this point, the story unfolds, and a mixture of science fiction and fantasy pepper the tale. You will find yourself confused with the odd terminology at times, as the story does make the presumption you are familiar with the Star Ocean universe (no pun intended). However, once you have played for a while, you will enjoy yourself.

Graphics and Sound

The game mixes rendered 3D environments with 2D sprite characters. This may irritate some gamers who may balk at the low-tech approach, but the world is colorful and interesting. The towns have great detail and are interesting to explore, if confusing. The only real complaint is the overworld, which is lackluster and generic. The towns looks like boxes with minor detail, and the environmental details (grass, trees), have horrible texturing and color. Fortunately, though, the gameplay mostly involves running in dungeons and/or cities, so this minor complaint shouldn't deter you.

The sound is very good, with decent music. The voiceovers are top-notch, with unique voices for each character. Combat is very annoying, with the characters announcing the name of each attack they are using every time they use it. As every important conversation involves text bubbles or dubbing, you don't have to play with the sound, and turning the sound off eliminates the need to hear the annoying combat announcements. Still, the ambiance of the music and hearing the conversations adds a nice element to the game, so it is your choice if you want to mute your PSP.

Overall

In short, I recommend this game for someone who either likes the Star Ocean franchise or is a devoted RPGer. If you are a casual gamer you may end up enjoying this game, but the amount of time you would need to invest to explore every aspect is high. Not to mention if you wanted to play with every possible character for your party you would need to replay the story several times over. For this reason, the replay value is high. Between the story, the gameplay, and the depth of the crafting system, the game is definitely fun. If you never played this game when it was first released (like me), it is also worth picking up to see the first adventure within the Star Ocean series, and also to understand Claude's references to his father from the second game (that comment is specifically for you RPG junkies who played Second Story). Overall, if you are craving a good RPG fix that doesn't involve endless combat menus, this title is for you.",neutral
2857,"This was the first ""Star Wars"" based game I've played, so I'm not gonna compare it to others of the series (although I'm now trying to hunt 'em down due to playing this one).
In my opinion, this game does play out like the movie. It has the music, the sound effects, the layouts, the characters and everything. I got this game as part of a sound-card bundle, and I've been playing it obsessively since I loaded it.
I like using the Force to choke Storm Troopers to death, using dual light-sabers (and you can pick which color saber you want), exploring all kinds of terrains and clipping off people's limbs with said light-saber.
Some of it is a bit contrived (like didn't Boba Fett get eaten by that big worm thing when Luke opened up his jet-pack in the movie? I mean, how is he now chasin' you all over one of the missions if he's supposed to be worm chow?). Also the cameo apperances of most of the cast seemed a bit more like ""We were in the movie!"" than blended into the story.
Otherwise, great game. Replay-ability is fairly high... I'm planning on playing it through again twice. Once with a character who's almost totally ""Dark Side"" and another totally ""Light Side"". You DO get to pick which side your character is on, and you make decisions based off which side you wanna be on... also, your jedi masters will let you know how close to the dark side you are.
Requirements: I was runnin' it fine on a Athlon 1800+, GeForce 4 Ti-4200 and 512 Megs PC-2100 (Windows XP). Very few slow-downs, no mess-ups. I upgraded to a Geforce 5900FX, but it looks good and runs great on a GF4.",neutral
2858,9/10 yr. olds were excited when first received this game. After playing it a few times they got bored. Now I have to make them play this game before allowing them to play the games they really want to. 9/10 yr. olds are very fickle with video games. Interest doesn't last long.,positive
2859,"Let me start off by saying that this mouse will be great for most people but it didn't work out for me.
Recently I broke my corsair m65(yes before rgb) due to rage and I decided to pick this guy up ath the local best buy. I got home and went straight to csgo. It was amazing. The sensor was great, it was light, it was rgb. The problem arose after a few hours of gameplay when I realized my hand was getting sore. That never happened with my m65. Turns out it was too narrow for me(I have a 10 inch span between pinkey and thumb when extended). I thought it might just be my hand but I went back to my m65 and it felt fine. I also like to claw grip and i found in that this mouse likes to be palmed and the center of gravity for it is too far back to be even. I also find my pinkey getting stuck under the mouse when i move right. For most people this will feel great in the  hand. On the subject of complaining though the mouse buttons are too mushy for me. There's too much travel between clicking and starting the actual click. I like the responsive feeling of their mamba te and the m65 better.",neutral
2860,"This was my first fighting game.  I had a few friends teaching me the basics and some more advanced stuff but most of the time I found myself spamming the moves I could pull off easily.

The things I like about the game are the online ranking system, it works well.  I find myself at about 50:50 for win/loss, which in my eyes shows matchmaking is doing a good job at keeping it challenging, yet rewarding.

The main story mode is kind of hit or miss.  I can't bring myself to watch the cheesy cutscenes and movies.  Having to unlock some of the characters can be grueling as well.  Some people just run right through Seth (Cammy, Zangief, Rufus, the French fighting guy, and Sagat).  I was never able to get the hang of the charge characters.  I've used a joystick and controller (with Kontrol Freeks), and I do much better with the controller.  There's not really a good way to learn these moves either because if you don't do them fast enough it doesn't count it as a move anyway.

The graphics are cartoony, but good.  I mean, there really isn't much to program except about 12 maps, 100 moves, and 30 characters, so it should have good graphics.  My friends complain about how much less skill this game takes over SF2 because the moves don't require as much speed and accuracy on the controller.  Where it was my first fighting game, I kinda need all the help I can get.

All in all, it's not my thing, I'm more of a CoD and Forza person, but this game was fun to learn and play around with from time to time.",positive
2861,"Because aside of the cool game play, great Jedi Knight II quality graphics and sound, very good AI, and both great sp and mp modes etc, the animated blood & gore + voilence in this game is too nasty. You can literally tear people apart by using just a knife to make their face a blood festival and just cut half of it off etc. It's nasty. And so are the blood sounds. They actuall BLEED when they fall to the floor.  And limp when you shoot them in the leg. TOO REALISTIC! Besides that, it ran fine, especially with my new 9500 pro. I cranked up the resolution to 1024x768 and all other settings maximum and still ran like a smooth buttah. I don't suggest this game for gamers that can't take M rated quality gore & blood + animated voilence, or even AO quality, because this game is the nastiest game i have ever seen in my LIFE. I don't suggest this for every gamer...:/(although is a great game overall)",positive
2862,"Let me start off by saying that this mouse will be great for most people but it didn't work out for me.
Recently I broke my corsair m65(yes before rgb) due to rage and I decided to pick this guy up ath the local best buy. I got home and went straight to csgo. It was amazing. The sensor was great, it was light, it was rgb. The problem arose after a few hours of gameplay when I realized my hand was getting sore. That never happened with my m65. Turns out it was too narrow for me(I have a 10 inch span between pinkey and thumb when extended). I thought it might just be my hand but I went back to my m65 and it felt fine. I also like to claw grip and i found in that this mouse likes to be palmed and the center of gravity for it is too far back to be even. I also find my pinkey getting stuck under the mouse when i move right. For most people this will feel great in the  hand. On the subject of complaining though the mouse buttons are too mushy for me. There's too much travel between clicking and starting the actual click. I like the responsive feeling of their mamba te and the m65 better.",neutral

2864,"In short, Acrobatic move and button sequence such as Lara's move are challenging and exiting.
I think everybody who loves Max Payne definitely loves this game. Story is nothing special unlike Max Payne,
but interesting enough. Unlike both of them, the game heroine, Ruby, has a powerful hack and slash move other than gun play. If you like clean display, go to option menu uncheck display effect. It is sometimes annoying. The most challenging part so far are Aircraft explosion evading and gangbike chasing sequence.

2868,"Subtitled Rogue Squadron II, this GameCube game lets you fly spaceship in the Star Wars universe and take on the original Star Wars universe.
I've always been a huge fan of space combat games, from the other Star Wars games to the Wing Commander games. The graphics were very nice, but not hugely better than those other games. The flying and ships are in the same arena.
The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward. Eleven missions, each with its own objectives. They're not always clear about where to go next or what to do. If you die, you're sent back to the beginning of a section to start again. If you happen to catch on, this means you can win the entire game in a few hours. if you happen to get stuck on a given area, you could be replaying the exact same scene OVER and OVER again.
Definitely a must-have for any true Star Wars fan, to relive the fun of that first movie. And space-flight fans like me will enjoy it for its nice graphics. But others might want to rent it a few times from the local store to make sure it's what they enjoy before buying it!",neutral
2869,"If you liked Resident Evil 4, give Dead Space a turn because it's exactly the same as that legendary series. You're pretty much a lone nerd on a doomed spaceship who's expected to save the day. Hordes of vicious and disgusting aliens rush from every conceivable place, and your job is to cut 'em up into squishy chunks. You're constantly at a loss for ammo while being put in tight situations, much like Resident did.
DS is a great game. The designers used vacuum and zero gravity in clever ways. Once I tried to use my flame thrower in vacuum only to find it didn't work. I forget that no oxygen means no fire - nice touch. Also, when in vacuum, there is no sound. All you can hear is the sound of your breathing as you cut aliens to ribbons. And the graphics rock.
Dead Space is awesome, but it's not a game I'd buy. I rented it and rushed through it. There's no online part, no dlc, no multiplaer. It's a closed game, and a short one. Don't buy it for $59.99 but definitely check it out.",negative

2872,"The Sega Genesis Collection for the Playstation 2 is a collection of twenty-eight games from Sega's most popular console. The games that are included in the collection are: Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Altered Beast, Bonanza Bros., Columns, Comix Zone, Decap Attack, Ecco the Dolphin, Ecco: The Tides of Time, Ecco Jr., Flicky, Gain Ground, Golden Axe I-III, Kid Chameleon, Phantasy Star II-IV, Ristar, Shadow Dancer, Shinobi III, Sonic the Hedgehog I & II, Super Thunder Blade, Sword of Vermilion, Vectorman I & II, and Virtua Fighter II. The ports of each game are pretty well done and the controls are nicely mapped to the Playstation 2 controller. The only downside to this collection is that while it does contain a good deal of classic Genesis games, there are also a few games that could have been replaced with others. Games like Flicky, Gain Ground, Super Thunder Blade, and the like are decent games, but I'm sure that there are other games in Genesis' library that would have been better choices. Besides that small flaw this collection is wonderfuly down and features enough great games to make it worth the money.

At first glance, this game looks like a standard 2D side scroll style game. The graphics are good, sounds, and all that good and exactly what I expected.

All of the stuff I hated from part 1, they have fixed. Stealth is actually a viable option in most missions here. It takes great teamwork to do, but when you do it feels like such an acomplishment. The reason it didn't make 5 stars is that I feel they COULD have done things a little better. Don't let that lack of 1 star fool you though. This game is AMAZING, and while I do have some issues with the developers, they do manage to  pump out new content frequently enough, and with the addition of ""Infamy"" levels, it has added alot of longevity to the game.",positive

2886,"EDIT::  I was able to get used to the mouse after about 3 weeks and replaced my naga with it.  The first few times I used it I did accidentally hit the G key, and I did feel a bit of strain in the right side of my hand.  I adjusted my grip and those became a none issue.

  This is a great mouse and an excellent mmo mouse.  The buttons are easy hit and recognize because each button has a unique shape and in placed ergonomically.  the ring finger button or g key can be changed to any button including modifiers like alt which effect both the thumb buttons and your keyboard.

I basically never misclick with this mouse, it's too well designed.  The one major criticism is this is that it's a laser mouse, that being said I use this is fps and I do quite well with it.  I have a non laser optical mouse from them and it's a great mouse but being more comfortable with this mouse ends up making it better for me.

the naga and corsair versions of this mouse are both less comfortable and noticeably lower quality from the moment you pick it up.  Logitech just makes good products in general.

Review based on initial impressions below.

PROS::
-High quality parts.
-Easy to reach and tell which thumb button you're using
-Responsive
-Easy set up
-G key is a fantastic idea, I will set it to alt so my keyboard also has many more buttons.

G KEY::
Some say to get rid of it but I disagree.  It's a great idea, (not to modify mouse buttons, but to modify keyboard buttons) though you have to get very used to the mouse before using it, updated ergonomics would fix that.

TLDR::
If I can get used to the feel, I will use this over my naga.  The construction quality, contoured thumb buttons, and placement of the G key as an alt key modifier for my keyboard is too great to pass up.",positive
2887,"Very nice keyboard. The compact design cleans up my desk quite a lot compared to my old over-the-top gamer style keyboard. The rubberized keys are nice but catch my fingers sometimes as I move them, which can be a little annoying but nothing really major, just my own typing habit. Only oddity is having the arrow keys baked in to the number pad (not like the usual 2/4/6/8, but down at the bottom in usual arrow key fashion) which requires toggling numlock to use them. Not a huge deal, but it means I have to actually pay attention to numlock rather than leave it on all the time.",positive
2888,"My favorites are the ski jump and the downhill skiing. I have learned quite a bit about skiing from this game (grew up water skiing, not snow). I would like for the events to be longer in length - to produce a more sustained workout. But, overall I enjoy this game.",negative
2889,"First off yes, this game is hard if you're not following a guide. And yes, it does have texture popping issues. However, the story, gameplay and party build-up are some of the best I've ever seen from this genre. The voice acting is also top notch. Following the right guides you can build your characters to the point of godliness, making the game much easier. As for length the main story will take you about 15-20 hours. The whole experience complete with sidequests however could take anywhere from 40-100 hours, depending on how much leveling or component gathering you do. I give this game a 7/10. Not perfect, but a whole lot of fun.",negative

2893,"Talk about a hit-or-miss game, this defines it. The areas where it succeeds, it succeeds wildly. The areas where it fails, it fails miserably.

Let's start with the bad and get it out of the way. The main city map is miserable and boring. The various tasks and jobs are dry and uninteresting. Searching for the balls (to upgrade) and the playing cards is no incentive whatsoever to explore the lifeless world. You would think at this point they could at least make a world on par with GTA3, but not even close.

Now the good. The bosses are some of the most over-the-top and ridiculous characters ever to grace a video game. They are amazing personalities, prefaced always by entertaining cutscenes. The boss battles are equally fun, requiring a surprising amount of strategy (button mashing fails miserably). A skilled player can beat any boss taking little to no damage, but a novice will get beat up pretty quick. The combat system is much deeper than it seems initially. Also, the game retains an outstanding and quirky sense of humor throughout. It's certainly adult and stays true to itself.

Overall this game is a huge bargain at under $20. There's really nothing else out there like it. Far from perfect (that time between boss battles can really drag), there's still so much RIGHT in the game that it can't be missed.",neutral
2894,"Prototype may not be the nicest looking or polished game out, but it sure is a ton of fun. There is just so much to do and the action never stops.

2895,long gone,negative
2896,"I've been very hooked on this game lately!  I've been reading about its making for years, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  In some ways, it meets my hopeful expectations.  It's very addictive---you are truly driven to try to get your movies to be better rated, your stars more experienced and happier, your lot bigger and more varied and your money situation more stable!  It's kept me up night after night, wanting to release just one more movie!

However, I've found some areas quite annoying.  There seems to be a constant shortage of labor in the world this game operates in.  Even when I managed to have my studio rated #1, even during the depths of the Depression when you would think anyone would be very eager to be a highly paid movie star, no-one is lining up at my gates to work.  So I am forced to overwork my few stars and directors to the point that they are driven to drink.  This seems very artifical, like something built into the game just to make it harder.

The game also becomes sort of formula driven after a while.  Once you figure out what works (always make movies in the currently popular genre, don't try to write your own scripts, make your stars practice all the time) you find yourself doing that over and over, just to keep the studio high rated in the futile hope you might someday get more stars to choose from.  I found it easy to make money, but after a while there is little to spend it on.

The stars are quite bizarre looking!  I would think with the whole of Hollywood to choose from, a studio could cast a few more normal looking folk!

I tried a lot to make my own scripts.  The movie maker is a little hard to use, and even after watching the tutorials and reading the manual, I had a lot of areas I was uncertain about. Do I have any control over how long scenes are?  How do I put something in an actor's hand?  I think it should be easier to figure these things out!

This sounds like a lot of criticism, and I don't mean to be so critical.  This is a great game in a lot of ways.  I think however it's more of a great GAME, one you figure out the rules to and play the best you can, than a great SIMULATOR, that really gives you the feel of making movies.  So if you are okay with that, I would say buy it with confidence---you'll have lots of fun!",positive
2897,"First off there are no edit numbers in regular season mode, but there is one in Association mode, which is better than nothing! What you do is start Association, then control a team for example the Celtics, then edit the numbers (Gerald Green wears #25 but that's Celtic great KC Jones retired number, so I edited that) and then save, then export the team. Load the team, then it will be playable in exhibition/quick play and the players will have the updated numbers.

I played an overtime and the teams changed courts. Teams do not change sides for OT.

The Pacers new jerseys are not available right of the bat, I think there might be a code for those. The ridiculous ""Kid Pix"" retroes are still there. They have yet to fix that.

You cannot edit a player's position.

There are no starting lineup introductions. Instead, the announcer yells the names of the players during the pre-game loading screens. What's funny is then it goes to a cut scene of

the arena or the city, and then shows the players running out of the locker room tunnel. Why then, are they being introduced prior to that??

Speaking of cutscenes, they are ok. I've always liked cutscenes in the 2K series. For example if I play as the Lakers, they show the Hollywood sign, then the fans entering the dome, and finding their seats. In NY they show the bridge and the city. For some arenas where they don't have reknowned landmarks they just show people entering the dome, grabbing food and beer, and finding seats. There are also cutscenes during the game.

What I find annoying are the ads. Toyota. Gatorade. And last but not the least, the annoying Power Bar. Power Bar sponsors the player of the game, and the Triple Threat instant replays.

When the replays come on, a Power Bar ad flies by, and there is a delay when you try to skip it, the button press does not work right away.

Announcing team is Kevin Harlan, and yes, Kenny Smith. Kenny is in two basketball games (LIVE 06) this year. However, the 2K6 Kenny sounds subdued and scripted. Harlan is the usual Harlan, with his Harlan-isms and all, and an improvement over the announcers from past games. However, it could've been better. Craig Sager is also there, virtually, doing the courtside reporting, and he wears the same garish suits as in real life.

The arena announcer is new this year, I think he is the Kings announcer, but I could very well be wrong. He does not yell the names of the rookies, just by numbers, amazingly, Harlan

knows the names, but Kenny doesn't! And what's strange is you can create a player with a common name, and the announcers will say the name!

I played a game as the Warriors. The Warriors are a great team in this game. Troy Murphy constantly gets double-doubles, Pietrus is a shooter and a high-flyer, and a defensive

stopper. I just cannot get the hang of the crossover and other dribble moves. This game uses the new shot-stick which is the right analog stick, and that was the previous Iso-Motion

dribble moves. Speaking of which, I have yet to find the benefits to shooting with the shot stick. I use the button and it works as well, I pop three's, perform highlight reel jams,

and nifty layups with both. On defense the right stick is for the strip and rip, it's easy to skyjack, snag inbounds, and fill passing lanes with this, which results in several steals.

Overall this game is ok. It is still kind of similar to last year's game minus the ESPN license, the graphics are similar, and the domes are still the same. I have a gripe about the Toyota Center, the arena is still the Summit, but the floor is Toyota Center's. The Pacers also have a brand new court design. And oh yeah, Doc Rivers does not look like himself at all. He looks more like, J.R. Smith.

I recommend this game if you have a XBOX and would like the best graphics possible, and also if you can put up with the ads!",negative

There really isn't much wrong with it, the only problem I have seen in the PS3 version is that it's frame rate is a little too much at times for the PS3. That is the only problem. People just expect way too much out of a game. The only reason you've heard the PS4 version is fun is because the PS4 can handle that frame rate.",negative
2901,"I'm a big fan of the first game, it was one of my favorite games then and it still grips me for a long while even today. I liked the fact that it was a new franchise, and wasn't something rehashed from a bunch of already done games. That game was incredible.

But this isn't the same Lost Planet I knew...I was actually very amazed at the changes!

First off, if you hated being tumbled around in the first game, well...it's not any better this time around. But there ARE new twists that help to balance out the gameplay.

*actual ""gameovers"" aren't as easy now, as data posts now act as ""respawn"" points, bringing a sort of online shooter feel to the game.

*actual ""deaths"" are now an issue, as your T ENG does not automatically replenish your life gauge when you're injured. so you'll need to be quite defensive during your playthrough.

*the addition of the battle gauge limits how many times you can ""respawn"" in the game...and it's shared by all co-op participants. activating data posts adds 500 to your BG pool, while respawning costs 500.

*the addition of shields greatly help to elevate the possibilities during fire fights; more defensive approaches can be plotted and more rewarding co-op gameplay can be had. also the new ""battle armor"" helps to even the odds in bigger battles, while standing in for your life until depletion.

*a new ability to shoot T ENG to your team mates has been added. basically just hold Y and push LT and you'll switch to your T ENG pool. if an ally is low just aim at them and pull LT, you'll send bursts of T ENG their way. great for avoiding costly respawns.

There are so many other co-op enhancements in the game that I find it odd that GameTrailers would call its multiplayer ""out-dated"". But whatever, my opinion is that my money was well spent. Just make sure to have friends over...seriously, the game has several points where having a helping hand can turn frustration into fun.",positive
2902,"I missed this game when it first came out, and now it can only be found with re-sellers.  It's a real shame there's no way to make sure the folks who made this game got a peice of what I payed for it.  This game has some very original art work and characters.  Controls feel right, and the game is well put together.  A good time for anyone who plays it.  Though not an all time classic like 'Zelda' or 'Ratchet & Clank', it does soundly belong in the next greatest level under them.  If you can find a copy of this one, it's well worth the $20-$30 it's likely to cost you.",positive
2903,"Being pretty into paintball, and having spent (way) too much time playing Ghost Recon 2 and Halo 2, I didn't expect much out of this game.  Still, for the price (go to Best Buy to pick this up for significantly less than listed) I thought I'd give it a shot.  And man, was I shocked.

The graphics are excellent. Not Ghost Recon excellent, but definitely good enough, and well above what I expected.  No poly-clipping or slowdowns, smooth animation and movement, and nice little details like the magic puff at the end of the barrel.

The sound is a little gimpy.  The general audio and the player babble is fine, the referee sounds good, and the ""god"" voice sounds like something out of Mortal Kombat.  The music/soundtrack is definitely too limited and kind of niche-y, but it's mostly acceptable. Not the strongest point in the game, but it doesn't really take away from it.

The gameplay is where this game *really* shines. It is absolutely amazing how well it captures what actual paintball play is like.  Snapping, running, diving, popping up, switching hands, it's all there, and it's all pretty intuitively put together. I thought this would just be a rehash of an older FPS engine with a 'paintball' motif, but it's actually a well put together engine that really takes into consideration a lot of the aspects of pball. There's even cheating, and while I originally thought that'd be a really silly thing, it's actually so well implemented that it really adds to the game.

Some things that shone less are the AI of your teammates and the online play. Your teammates (especially in the initial tournaments) are pretty useless, but as you improve (and the quality of your teammates improves) they actually do score hits and even pick up the flag. There's no way to speak with them, though, so the tactical aspects of paintball (at least in single-player mode) aren't really addressed.

Online play is where I really expected this game to be out of control, especially after playing the single-player. Unfortunately, Xbox-Live! games only last about 30-40 seconds as everyone basically runs around bunkering.  Larger games (with more players) are somewhat better, but even the slightest lag makes the game unplayable. The observation mode once you're tagged out is really nice, though.  If you play with friends on a consistent basis, you can really start communicating and making tactical decisions that add serious dimension to the game.

Even for full price, this game is worthy, particularly if you're even remotely into paintball.  For any discounted price it's worth it, period. This game qualifies as a true 'sleeper', because it was designed to appeal to a very niche market but the gameplay is good enough to be enjoyable across the whole spectrum, regardless of age or involvement in paintball.

All told, the game's a blast.",positive
2904,"I've never played a dungeon crawler game nor have I ever played the Persona series. With that being said I rented this from GameFly and liked it so much I decided to just buy it and keep it for $29.99. The game is not a 5 star game, it'd have to offer more to get that rating. The graphics (via battle) are somewhat ok. They look like a PS2 game but, shouldn't be a big deal to many as this is a Vita game and not a console game. Plus, I can speak for myself when I say I don't play games just for graphics. I play them for enjoyment. The game is fun, cut scenes/art is beautiful on the Vita's screen, I love the characters and the different personalities they have, and you have an option to listen to voices in English or Japanese. Now I usually set my voices in most JRPG's I play to Japanese but, the English voices were actually good and I like them better than the Japanese this time around. MIND Zero is not spectacular but, it is good game and addicting. I think those that were on the fence about getting this should definitely make the jump to do it, you won't regret it. It has its flaws but, in my opinion they're minor. Anyone who has played dungeon crawlers and or Persona should feel right at home with this. I also see it as good support buying this game a company took time and money to bring to the west. I don't want to spoil the ending but, just know if this sells well over here what you can expect. I hope my review was somewhat helpful. If you're still on the fence or don't like my review try watching videos/game play on YouTube or a gamer's website.",positive

2907,"I was leary of this game because of the poor Gamespot review, but I got it as a Christmas gift and decided to give it a try.  And I'm glad I did.  The controls take a bit of practice, but they work well.  You have to use subtle movements of the Wiimote for good control.  There is a delay to the sword swinging, but its not bad.  The graphics are decent and the story entertaining.  I love the atmosphere-reminds me a bit of Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox.  If you like first person shooters then this is the one to get.  I finished Call of Duty 3 on the Xbox 360 and I liked Red Steel more.",positive

2910,Pricing was good at the time.  A decent game but not quite up to the level of an Elder Scrolls title.  A bit repetitive and tedious at times but it kept me interested enough to complete the game and some side missions.,positive
2911,"I have both the PS3 and PS4 versions of the game. So I will draw a few comparison's between the two.

There are quite a number of reviews going on about this game's ""poor graphics"". They are about half right. I myself have did not have an issue with the graphics until I saw the fist man on screen with facial hair. It does look much like a GI Joe beard. Now if you are someone who that will totally ruin a game for,  then do not bother. Move on and save your money.

For anyone who is still around here comes the real review.

Story: (I am about 20 hours into the game, and probably 1/3 of the way through.) It is a Bioware RPG. They pretty much have plot and story as their MO. This game is no different, assuming you choose to move on with it. That last statement is important. Once you leave the opening tutorial you will be sent on a mission to the Hinterlands area to start. This is where I made a critical error since I have a bit of OCD need to complete everything in an RPG. The game was starting to become another Skyrim for me, to where I could get lost for hours exploring. I enjoy such, but it has to be taken in moderate doses. This was a major change from Dragon Age's previous installments, which were far more focused on character interaction, than the gameplay. (Yes DAO and DA2 were essentially visual novels with some action scenes thrown in to mix up the gameplay) I became frustrated with the game after getting my tail kicked by a few areas and finally moved on to one of the newer opened places once I gave up clearing an event and that is when the game took off. I do not like to post spoilers, so I won't go into detail, but I can say that the game they have put together more than makes up for DA2's incompleteness, and Mass Effect 3's botched ending.",negative
2912,"This game is unfortunately the victim of much criticism, often seen as nothing more than a lazy Genesis port. As I play it, I come to the conclusion that had the game been released exclusively for the Saturn, it could have been much more well received than it was. True, the main gameplay is all but the same, but all the care that was put into creating the Saturn version truly turned it into a good game.

First of all, the control is much better here: both the 3d controller and the model 1 controller work very well with the game. The visuals are one of the most noticeable differences. The environments are vibrant and stunning and there's many little things that really impress me: probably the best example is on the second zone Rusty Ruin: the fog and rain effects on this level are brilliant and really create a mood that just isn't present on the Genesis game. The music is another exceptional part of the game, however, as many people also love the Genesis version's music, it really comes down to personal preference here.

The absolute best thing about this game however that makes this version superior is the special stages! They have the same objective as Sonic 2 special stages however things are much improved: everything is in full 3d and looks great! You also aren't purely limited to moving left and right in a half pipe, now there are springs, platforms, and awesome corkscrew tunnels. Even when you've got all the chaos emeralds you'll be finding yourself looking for Tails and Knuckles so you can play these levels some more!

There is one downside to this version which forces me to give 4 stars instead of 5: the loading times! It's especially maddening when you complete a special stage: first you wait for it load a while, then it displays a ""loading"" screen, and then finally you get back to the game!

If you're a Saturn owner I highly recommend this one. Yes it's unfortunate we never got Sonic X-Treme, but I for one am glad Sega did at least give us this awesome and many times superior port!",positive

2916,"MLB 11 THE SHOW and MLB 2k11

To start out, ill admit it i am a THE SHOW fan boy and have played every copy of the show ever made.  Also i have NEVER played the 2k series on the ps3. (had on 360 when i had 1 and ps2)  This year the show to me is broken, so i went ahead and purchased this game.

Here is my review for both games...
GRAPHICS

THE SHOW- The show in this category is the clear cut winner.  The player models are PERFECT, they have all the players faces and it really looks like them.  Stadiums are beautiful and the main menu is pleasing to the eye.

2k11- Really lacking in this area.  Player faces are for a 2011 game PATHETIC, for a lack of a better word the graphics are blurry (something is just not right) They only have the big stars faces and it barly looks like them like what i said very very bad.  The stadiums are very detailed, fans actually move and the main menu is the quick game menu.  Also the long hair in this game is so bad, you can see its short hair with strans of long hair on back they are not even the same color

WINNER by a landslide- THE SHOW

GAMEPLAY

TS- Very smooth... but in many ways unrealistic.  Any pitcher who has a 5.00 era will be Lincecum on this game. (my brother threw a perfect game with Kyle Davies...COME ON!)  The AI is too perfect in this game, not many errors the ai pitching is very difficult to solve even on rookie.  When your pitching to the cpu it is hard to fool and paint the corners.  Analog controls are a bit off.

2k- not much better.  Analog is better but i still don't like it.  The gameplay is weird, as fielders catch the ball really weird.  The screen itself is a bit too busy, theres way too much going on.  Also this game has better pitch movement you can tell the difference from a FB and a CUTTER.

WINNER- Very close in crappyness- THE SHOW

CAREER

TS- RTTS is the best career mode in any sport game.  You can either enter draft or select a team.  You get points per AB or batter faced and based on that you get 21 points for a great one or even more for a good play in clutch situations, and around 10 for ok moves.  But, theres a glitch you will always be traded no matter what.

2k- haven't played it much but it seems good.  I don't like how you cant enter the draft, but i guess that isn't too big of a deal to many.  I just really don't like the helper he doesnt shut up!

WINNER- THE SHOW

FRANCHISE

TS- Same old one for about 6 years now... Really needs some upgrading... Trading is broken on this game, you cant trade after two years, and even if you put on forced trades they still don't work.  Also the budget system is broke.  After 3 seasons the top players are all FA's because nobody has any money, so this option needs to be off... and there is no real contracts

2k- Not much different than the show but hey at least you can trade.  They have the real player contracts and the menus are better.  In the fantasy draft tho, the AI only takes SP and the fake prospects that have 5 star potential.

Winner -2k

Commentary

TS- Boring, old, mute it, put on music... next

2k- like the real thing, they did a great job

BY FAR winner- 2k

The rosters (my big thing)
TS- The same every year, cant edit them much, the bar overalls are hard to judge how good the really are

2k- FINALLY for pitchers you can edit if they are strong against lefties or righties.  You can fix their potential (in the show you cant so Sam Fuld is a D so that means in franschise or RTTS he will not get better) I haven't been able to check their mlb today or the roster updates due to the psn outage. Also number overalls thank you so much easier to edit the players my way

Winner -2k

Overall 2k is a good game but looks wise its very ugly.  Players are so bad and it just seems like something is a miss when playing a full game.  This year gameplay in both series is down and not very enjoyable.  This game is on its way but still needs alot of work.  If i had to choose one it would be the show because you can play multiple games without feeling like you actually just played a full 9 inning game.  Yes the show is not very good this year but the bottom line is its 2011 an there is no excuse for bad graphics anymore.  I guess ive been spoiled from the show graphics but the 07 verison of the show has better looking graphics than this game.

But i will keep 2k11 just because i love editing my own rosters and 2k11 has better ways of editing players, and i like frachise mode too and that is better on this game.  So ill be playing both... Now its your turn decide...

this year its a wash, both series need to step their game up BIG time in 2012...",positive
2917,"Its great, just needs to have a campaign mode in order to learn everything from the game",positive
2918,"The select and start buttons get stuck sometimes, but other than that, great controller. Dpad feels perfect.",negative
2919,"Let's face it, very few people actually NEED this skin. I, like many other people out there, simply wanted the XBOX to look sexier. Therefore, the bottom line is that this skin needs to be aesthetically pleasing.
Upon completion, does the skin make Xbox look better? My quick intuition leans towards a YES. When looked from afar, the new skin adds a little extra flare to my Xbox that is entirely black. Especially when the room theme is going to be predominately black and white, like mine, this Xbox outfit adds consistency.

However, god is in detail, and detail is what this skin lacks. First, this skin cannot endure close examinations, at least not mine. When looked closely, the imprecision shows as the skin does not always cover edges very nicely. The inevitable result is that the skin can look a little out of place and cheap.

Second, the fact that the product comes with no instruction kills the marketing nerdiness in me. It is puzzling because the vendor shows its attention to detail by having a cloth to clean up the Xbox prior to application, yet fails to include any effort to minmize the anxiety one may have applying the skin. The truth is that no matter how elementary a DIY product seems to be, an instruction IMO is necessary.

Lastly, the adhesiveness is worrisome to me. Two days have not even passed since the skin application but several areas already started to peel. This could render this skin useless because  aesthetically, any peeling is simply too hard on the eyes.

Overall, this skin is surely not a perfect product. However, for the amount of money I paid and the fact that the skin looks decent from afar, I am planning on keeping this outfit I bought for my lovely Xbox.",negative

2921,"I'm usually hesitant on buying refurb items but I needed a headset for Destiny and plantronics wasn't a great first choice. I started looking Turtle Beach's headsets and came across this one. I'm still on the X360 and the bluetooth between the controller and headset intrigued me. I've read issues where voice sounded distant but wanted to try it out for myself. After testing voice chat using the included XBA bluetooth adapter, it was true. My teammate said I sound far away. Luckily, I went to BestBuy and bought the Turtle Beach talk back cable for cheap (amazingly). I switched from bluetooth to cable and I was heard perfectly. This isn't Turtle Beach's issue but more of how the X360 tries to handle bluetooth. When I bluetooth to my phone, conversations are perfect. I haven't bluetoothed it to my PS3 (I need next gen consoles :-( ) but I'm sure that'll work just fine.

Everything else works just fine and it's been a month of heavy Destiny gaming. It's also my first headset with full game audio. In the past I've only used headsets for chat. I never knew how much of the game's sounds I've been missing. I feel like going back to play my old games.",positive
2922,Strange. Good shipping,positive
2923,"I can't review this game that very well because to see what it really is, is for you to watch a gameplay or buy it yourself. I was bored one day and went into the PS4 live show place where people broadcast and I found someone playing this and I got hypnotized by it by having so many characters and so much gameplay! I love it and would gave it 5* BUT It doesn't have online coop which is sad... But it does have 2 player mode which doesn't make sense why not to have online? Anyways, neither the less this game is another must play or have game for the PS4 because it is very very addictive!",positive
2924,seems to be working well,positive
2925,"I will likely buy another in the future.

This replaced a shot stick in a classic controller. Installation was simple. I found everything fit well in the controller, except for the Z button. At first I thought it wouldn't work, but on testing, the Z button responds perfectly. However, there is very little movement of the button as it is depressed.

The stick itself responds great. I play mostly Super Smash Bros. and this replacement has brought new life to my old controller, saving me the additional money to purchase a whole controller.",positive
2926,"I think EA has produced their best version of FIFA yet.  At minimum, this is definitely the best version on the next-gen consoles.  The gameplay is much better and much more realistic than past versions.  My only real beef with the gameplay is that sometimes your players do not make very smart, or timely runs, when you are on attack while sometimes your players end up out of position on defense because they seem to be drawn by something I can't figure out.  In all honesty, though, that does not happen very often and can be somewhat fixed by the custom tactics.  Speaking of which, the ability to customize tactics and formations (which, to be fair, has been available on past versions) make this game extremely enjoyable as well.

There have been tons of reviews so I can be succinct--the gameplay, customization, realism, tons of teams and leagues, and graphics are all great.  The only negatives are a lack of real stadiums, some players don't look like their selves (and this has been corrected in World Cup 10), the sounds and graphics of the crowds could be better, and the AI sometimes does strange things.  Overall, though, probably the best FIFA yet and makes me excited for FIFA 11.",positive
2927,"The review below was based on the original, ""buy the DVD"" version of the game. The software is now free on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. All of the bugs have been worked out, the install time is amazingly fast (compared to the install that the DVD required), and the updates are only a few minutes now, instead of over an hour (or four).

The game play itself hasn't changed much. There are some cosmetic changes here and there, such as the major ark falls. They also have had some seasonal events, such as a reindeer hunt around Christmas (hunt as in find, NOT shoot).

Overall, I have found the game to be very fun since Trion released version 2, and I highly recommend it to others. I am leaving the old review intact, just so you can get a feel for how bad it was, and compare the new version for yourself.

Granted, there is still the occasional crash, but it always feels (at least to me), that it is because there are just too many players in one spot, doing the same event at once. But when you stop and think about it, having too many players means there are a lot of people enjoying the game, and that is a positive thing, even if the crash is an inconvenience.

Unfortunately, the Ark Hunter DLC is still too important not to buy, since it leaves a hole in the game if you don't have it. But considering the hours of fun you'll have with version 2, it's worth the $10.

And by-the-way, when you buy the game new, there are some codes for items that will help you get started, so if you're the type of person that bought World of Tanks (another free game on the 360), you might want to consider grabbing the disc for this game as well.

Should Trion ever put out an Xbox One version, especially if I can keep my character, I will definitely install it.

I still can't stand the TV show, however.

The Original Review:

In the three weeks that I've been playing, I had to install three times. Once when I put it in my Xbox the first time, a second one within a week of playing because of a bad patch, and again today, because of a bad patch. It takes half an hour to install, and the first two patches were 1 1/2 hours each.

The first time I tried to patch today, the patch froze my Xbox (a common complaint on the message board for the game). This forced me to patch a second time, and again, I locked up. I was forced to clean the cashe, and install from scratch. That was half an hour to install, plus FOUR HOURS to patch. FOUR HOURS!

The company has also stopped taking direct questions via email or phone. You have to file a complaint via their site, and hope they answer within a few business days. No game is worth all of the install/patch time that this one requires on a weekly basis. And by the way, today's patch was to accommodate a dlc that isn't even out for another week or so.

If you think the bad reviews are an over reaction, look at Amazon's buy price for the game. Twenty one cents as I type this. Twenty one cents for a game that currently sells new for $10. That has to mean that there are more people selling their copies then there are people buying them used or new.

DON'T BUY THIS GAME!

UPDATE:

I Attempted to play this again. Things were fine for a few days, then yesterday, another long patch, due to the need to re-install. The patch was over 4 hours this time. I did have other things to do, so I let it run. Today came another patch. It installed, the game crashed, and I had to reboot my Xbox. When I went back to the game, it started to re-install automatically.

After almost 2 hours, I gave up, and turned it off. Later, I attempted to finish the patch, but for some reason I was told that I'd have to start the patch from scratch. Almost 2 hours later, the patching was done. I turned the game on, and was told that the patch was corrupt. I'd have to do it all over again, game install and the patch.

I have noticed that the people that get to bypass all of this <censored> are the people that have bought the most recent dlc for the game. Maybe I'm just being jaded or paranoid, but I think that Trion is trying to force people to spend money on the season pass or dlc. Either way, I am selling my copy.",positive

The addition of grinding to unlock armor is OK when left to purely visual customizations, but the specializations actually change the behavior/play... They seem to be borrowing from other multiplayer shooters and incorporating 'classes'... it's not quite class-based yet, but it doesn't feel like it belongs in Halo. Personal opinion.",negative

2934,"I bought this mostly for the light effects which exceeded my expectations. I use this keyboard for a mixture of light gaming, internet, and general communication which it works very well for. I don't care about gaming macros so I programmed the C-keys for other uses such as doc flip, zoom in and out, and volume controls. The keys have a good solid feel to them that is adequate for everyday use. I don't completely trust the top touch controls for volume and multimedia because they occasionally don't respond which is why I use the C-keys for those features. As far as seeing the lit up keys in the dark, I have tried several keyboards from Saitek, Microsoft and Logitech. This is the only one I can briefly glance at in complete dark and clearly distinguish all of the keys. The software is adequate but you need to read the directions as it is not very intuitive. As I stated I don't use the touch controls. If you're one of those people that get's frustrated and takes it out on the mouse or keyboard this probably would not be a good choice due to the sensitive electronics inside. So that's it, get it for the lights, and understand that this keyboard is limited in other areas.",neutral

2937,Received from Eforcity.  The charger works great and the batteries are long lasting.  It comes with little to no directions.  I do warn you that you should charge batteries for at least a day before use to ensure long life.  There is a power switch in the back you have to flip on for the batteries to start charging.  It comes with four batteries.  Wii remotes are not included.  It charges two wii remotes in front and two batteries in the back so you can easily switch out when your battery is low.  It is red when charging and blue when charged.  It plugs in to your wii.  It plugs in to the same place you plug in your power supply.  Then you just plug in your power supply on top of that.  My 4 star rating is for great product but no direction.,negative
2938,"This game is basically the same as the DS's first instalation of Guitar Hero this past June, but it also features song sharing, a way to utilize the first GH:DS to make the DS to DS multiplayer even more expansive (up to 53 songs to rock out together with). It includes 28 songs compared to the first instalation's 25 songs, which for the most part is a solid tracklist. It has its clinkers (as much as I love ""We Are The Champions"", I must admit that its 45-second piano solo do not fit Guitar Hero), but I love songs such as ""Can't Stop"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"".
  Overall, I'd say this is a pretty fun DS game. It may not vary much from the game of June, but if you liked that one, you'll have a blast with this one. Perhaps its not worth its $35 game-only price tag, but jamming out on the DS doesn't get much better than this.",positive

2940,"Since the Xbox unit has a built-in hard drive for saving games (and music, if you like), one may assume that one will never require a memory card (an essntial for the PS2 and Gamecube). But if one packs too much info onto the hard drive, then load times on most games increases (which I have discovered, to my regret), and games which use the hard drive to pre-load levels (such as Halo) take even longer. The solution? Use a memory card to save games, and thus save wear and tear on your hard drive. Sure, the drive is durable, but I'd rather use a $30 card than risk damage or wear on a critical Xbox component. The card does have a few drawbacks, though. For one, it will not transfer music files (it wouldn't hold many, anyway), and it will only allow the transfer of character profiles and not saved games (which I discovered when trying it with a friend's Halo saves). I've also found it to be useful when downloading the pitifully few codes/cheats available for the Xbox system (though try not to put saves and codes on the same card; corruption of the saved games is always a danger when doing this). But the benefits of this unit seem to outweigh its drawbacks, and so I recommend it. I do not, however, recommend any of the off-brand cards available for the Xbox. My experiences as both a consumer and a retailer have taught me that the Xbox brand card is by far the best.",negative

2942,"Arguably, there really is so much excitement when it does come to video football. No matter what kind of day it is, it has come a part of America's new past time. Even more than baseball. As for video games, none has shown it all the way like Electronic Arts andtheir Madden football series. It has been the most popular football franchise game series ever, and nobody has even ever come close. For fans of Sony's Playstation 2, they just couldn't get enough of it before, and it has just gotten better. The latest version is really no acception from the seven point touchdown!

Madden '06 for the Playstation 2 is arguably the best version among all the versions for the P.C., Gamecube and beyond. The graphics are just beautiful, and really capture beyond the imagination. You can play any one of the many great football teams whether it is the New York Giants, the Dallas Cowboys, or the Super Bowl victors the New England Patriots. The plays are just as realistic as you could gamble on, whether it is a hail mary field goal kick, or just an outrageous blitz. The control is really simplitstic, and easy to manuever for anybody who is either a beginner, or an advanced player who would like to score a imaginery ticket to the Super Bowl. The music and highlights also deliver very well, and have very little flaws toward it.

While there aren't that many new football games that the NFL sponsors right now, Madden '06 still keeps on going. This is a great game for the Playstation 2, and a must have if you're a die hard football fanatic. There is no ifs, ands or interceptions about it.

2945,"I got this on a recommendation.

This game actually contains the first WKC game, except changed a bit to allow your custom-character.  Apparently in the original release of WKC, you couldn't make a custom character.  Anyway, if you don't want to trudge through the WKC storyline because you have played it before, you can actually start off with WKCII with your characters starting out at lv35.

The combat interface of the game remind me a lot of Final Fantasy 11 and 12, but with a very customizable combo system.  With friends, it definitely plays more like FF11, but alone you have an AI script system for combat not unlike FF12's system.

It's a good RPG, solid mechanics, nice graphics, and not too bad storyline.  I do like that the main character doesn't whine too much, unlike Vaan from FF12.

I haven't really tried the online component, just played a couple of quests with a friend and it felt like FF11 with nicer graphics.

So not a bad game, pretty good.  But eventually I just got bored of it.",positive
2946,"This game is a lot of fun.  It's an RPG shooter with lots and lots of weapons and has the feel of an RPG, of course.

What would've been great is the thrid person view of your character.  Also, the game has cartoonish graphics, and althoug violent, makes the game look like a second-rate action RPG.

The town characters in the game really do not interact with you, they're practically static sprites who will talk to you only to give out a mission or reward you for one.  Aside from that, you really don't interact with them and it's all about the shooting and #$s kicking, which again although cartoonish is crude and your characters plain cold assassins.

A little more thought into the story would be more rewarding for the gameplay, as the game often turns repetitive with just shooting hoards and hoards of enemies with really no different skill than using some elemental weapon of choice or getting them in the head.

Aside from that, if you liked Fallout 3, don't expect this title to exceed Fallout 3 in any aspect of the game.  It's truly simplistic and apt for a tad more lazy minds who like more action than reading some story line, as happens in Fallout 3.

I still recommend it for any hard-core RPG player.  It's worth the investment.  Oh, and as for DLC, General Knoxx's Fort will suffice by far the other two, even combined.  Although, don't get it unless you want to advance up to level 61 for your skill chart, not too exciting really.",negative
2947,Awesome,negative
2948,"While this game got pretty bad reviews, they must've been playing another game.
This game is far from Ps1/2 Graphic wise! Go play Federation vs Zeon for the ps2, and then comment on graphics!

This game is Federation vs Zeon meets Zeonic front, mixed with some pretty good mechanics. So if you played those 2 titles for the ps2 you will love this one.

While some would say the controls are clunky, they are easy to learn and pick up.

Basically you pick a side(EFF or Zeon) you are then thrusted into the Asiatic theater of the 1 year war. Much like in Zeonic Front you are given a squad consisting of 2 other Mobile suits. as you progress you level-up and gain ranks, the levels increase your combat abilities while the ranks increase what mobile suits you can buy, and which pilots you can request.

The voice over is pretty meh, However it could be much worse, This game can be unforgiving at times, throwing countless enemies at you requiring to strategize in the later missions.

Your mobile suit can quickly become deteriorated during combat, suffering damage to limbs means you will loose them for the entirety of the Mission at hand, leaving you only with kicking melee.

Plus this game is quickly becoming a rarity, so get it while you can",positive
2949,"This is a good keyboard but it does have some flaws keeping it from being a 5 star. Those flaws can mostly be overlooked given the total package at an overall lower price point. This keyboard had everything I was looking for, quality build, dedicated media keys (so important) and rubberized wrist support. It's brushed metal so it looks nice, solid, and heavy. The main flaw is the software. It's not bad but it's not as intuitive as Logitech's gaming software. It does allow per key lighting or effects, but not both. The macros are hit and miss. Some macros need the software to be running even though it's saved to the keyboard. I can't launch a program or website without the software but the macro to put the computer to sleep works fine. The keyboard would sometimes not wake properly leaving only a few keys lighted and functional requiring you to reconnect the usb, though I'm told that it's a setting with Asus motherboard. A minor issue is the middle of the wrist support curves in so when you're typing, your right hand rest on that spot and doesn't have the same support. Still overall I like this keyboard even despite those flaws.

Pros
Sturdy metal
Dedicated media keys with a lighted volume indicator
Detachable wrist wrest
Macro recording on the fly with 3 profile
Nice extras like the attachable box of keycaps, foldable mouse wire clip, and a timer button
usb and sound pass through

Cons
Software
Keyboard may freeze upon wake up
The wrist rest design is flawed
The piping on the side just adds bulk",positive
2950,"Fans of the series or those who have seen the movie should really get into this game. You meet Alessa, a younger Dahlia, and other characters from the first game (no spoiler, this is explained right in the booklet). Some connections and explanations are also offered which were pretty vague before. Lights and sounds also seem to draw monsters far more than other games (didn't seem to make much difference in the other games). The mirror idea was pretty cool too although it seemed to give you some controll over this horrific world.

The downside...
I was disappointed by the ""new features"" in this game. One is the use of fixed camera angles which I actually liked in resident evil. They could've worked here too but weren't handled as well as the RE games. At times a monster may be 2' in front of you but its off screen so you don't know until you either walk into it or shoot blindly. A couple times you walk down an aisle and disappear until you walk out- who knows if anything was there to pick up or examine. In other SH games camera angles may be used but at least you can hit a button and look around.

New combat features include punching... which makes sense (always thought it odd in SH& RE games that your options are basically run or shoot- noone can kick, etc). But on the other hand, I restarted this game and it takes something out of the ""scare"" when you can just walk up to the monsters and punch them into submission. Another combat feature is the ability to pick up assorted items for striking. At the end of the game however, I had a truck load of appliances and items which I never used. How many TVs, crates, etc did I have in my pockets?

As for the ""scare"", well there really wasn't one. This is more of an action game with horror elements that a disturbing horror tale. This is the only SH game that I made it all the way through without EVER getting killed. (I did run more than usual, but still, even the bosses were pretty easy).

There are also some movement differences and they couldve given you clearer reasons for going from one place to the next (If I hadn't looked at the map after leaving the hospital I wouldnt have known where I was supposed to go next). Still, overall I gave it 4 stars for fun, but just 3 overall because it was a step back in many ways from previous games.",neutral
2951,"First of all, the violence in the game is pretty bad. As long as you can separate the silly game play from reality. I think this game is completely authentic to the theme of the movie. Allowing you to play through scenes in the movie and even play through moments only talked about in the film. the characters somewhat look like the actors for the most part. Some voices aren't exact. Obviously Mr. Blonde sounds great with the help of Michael Madsen. The guy doing Mr. pink does decent impression and Nice guy Eddies voice is DEAD on perfect!
 Game play is mostly a shoot-em-up style game. Collecting different weapons, smoke grenades, flash grenades as well as blueprints ( to unlock extras ). While your path of travel is somewhat limited, the scenery varies enough to keep it interesting. There are some mixed in driving missions which aren't too bad and have a strong similarity to the GTA games. There's hostage taking, manipulation and police opposition too. Sometimes hiding out and using stealth can get you out of a jam instead of just shooting your way out. Unlike some other games like GTA, hiding behind objects will sometimes throw the police off and keep them guessing where you are. Good graphics and easy to use controls with zoom in targeting. Great job on the sound too ( voices in other rooms, sirens, shattering glass ) I can't say enough about the great job they did with the accuracy of the movie to game story and play. If your a fan of the movie and these style games this is a must have! I am surprised at many of the negative reviews for this game. I can be picky with games but I enjoyed Reservoir Dogs a lot and think it has great replay value as well.",positive

2955,"I play this in 4K on PS4 Pro.  The great thing is its native 4K, and I really enjoy it more than I thought.  I've played Fifa since the genesis (mega drive) days.  But I only started really playing it annually since Fifa 09 on Xbox 360.

Playing in 4K, I can appreciate the fine details, like shoe details which were not as sharp on 1080p, grass, and overall presentation looks fantastic.  So big thumbs up.  Gameplay is still not much different from the past.  I've played the Journey and I really enjoyed it.  I usually play 1 or 2 hours of FIFA and stop, but the Journey kept me playing longer.  Just wished it was a longer story mode.  Now I play My Career and just play my own character.  FUT is boring, I used to really enjoy it in FIFA 13, but after that I felt EA got greedy and make it so hard to get good players.  So I'm done playing it, because all I focus on now is just trading players and I don't really care about my team as much.

Overall, beside FUT, I am enjoying the game.",positive
2956,"This game does the Dark Knight justice. As Batman, you have an assortment of gadgets at your disposal, including: baterangs, batgrapple, an electric stun gun, and restraint nets. Those are just a few of them. Batman is also able to use his cape as a sort of parachute to slow his decent if he falls from a high place. Don't try to jump to the street off of a building though because the mission will be failed. The game was well thought up. The Joker is killed early in the game. The next series of missions have to do with other villians who are trying to gain power such as Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. As it turns out, Batman was just a pawn in the sick game of the Joker. He returns near the end to reveal that Batman has set up his whole scheme for him with out even knowing it. During the game you are able to drive the batmobile and batplane. This game is fun to play because it actually requires you to think like the caped crusader and figure out little things all through out the game. So, if you think you might get frustrated with the game if you have to do a little bit of thinking, then rent it first before buying it. Other than that it is a good game for batman fans of all ages.

2960,"So these headphones look pretty awesome, they feel durable and I do think they will stand the test of time even though I've only had them for about 3 weeks.  The sound is really pretty great with a crystal clear mid and high range and nice deep lows.  You can precisely pick up where other people are in the game compared to your location in most first person shooters.  The microphone and chat volume levels are a little touching, but once you zero in on the proper volume levels it works just fine.  I wish you could hear yourself in the headphone, but unfortunately you can't.  I would say for general chatting these headphones are very mediocre but are most definitely an improvement over the headphones that come with the Xbox.

If I had one real complaint with the headphones it would have to be the size. They are just a fraction too small to fit comfortable for extended periods.  I can usually only leave these headphones on for about an hour.  Initially when I put them on they fit snuggly but are rather comfortable, but it wears on you after a while and I find myself pulling them off in between games and then putting them back on when the next game starts.

I got these headphones for $36 so they didn't have much they had to live up to, but if you're take your gaming really seriously and or have a much larger budget you'll want adjust your headphone search accordingly.  However, if you've never owned gaming headphones before and you want to see what its all about, these will do the trick.",positive
2961,"This is a challenging game series like Dark Souls with a stiff learning curve. It's big in Japan with annual releases practically like Call Of Duty outside of Japan. You could easily sink 300+ hours into this game grinding large monsters on missions for rare drops to upgrade your armor, weapons or items for crafting better items. MH3U was originally a Wii game -- non U -- and this ups the ante with new weapon classes, new armor, more missioniplayer though, which is major part of the game where half the missions are: I haven't tried it once. I like to play at my own pace and don't want to hold or bes, new monsters and probably a better online match making system. MH3U is essentially an HD upscaled directors cut of the Wii game.

About mult held back by anyone as I come up with equipment strategies for hunting or capturing monsters on missions. All multiplayer missions can be attempted solo and regardless of what you've read online, even if you play solo their gonna be harder than the Moga Village single player missions. I've played for about 100 hours and have hit a difficulty wall trying to do level 8 Moga Village quests, got bored and moved onto other things. Where does that leave the online quests you may do solo? As far as I'm concerned, you deserve a pat on the back if you play though enough to defeat the Ceadeus which pretty much sums up the Single player story, but that's only a level 5 difficulty mission. I've thoroughly gotten my money's worth out of this game just playing the Single player to this point and intend on going back to it sometime. This game takes commitment with missions running over 30 minutes commonly, so it's not exactly pick up and play. Managing your items and equipment can also be quite time consuming. There's no HP number system for yourself or the monsters you fight, just meters without numbers for yourself and NONE AT ALL on the monsters. For the large monsters you need to pay attention to their mannerisms to estimate how much health they have left. Limping while running away means their health is low and ready to capture and salivating means their stamina is low and ready to eat. In a nutshell, you attack big monsters until they get injured, then you attack them until they die.

This game series is well suited for local coop among friends which is why it's primarily a 3DS game series now. Having 4 Wii Us setup in the same room would be a challenge and I'm not qualified to judge mic chat on Wii U because I've never heard or have used it. MH3U must be the best entry in the series on console. It sounds like the series has expanded a lot since the PS2 days when it originally debuted like Pokemon has evolved over the years. I find myself playing sitting back in a recliner with my feet up, my Wii U gamepad plugged into the wall so it never runs out of juice. MH3U supports OFF-TV PLAY so you can play everything from the gamepad screen. I actually prefer it that way because my seating for the TV where the Wii U is hooked up is a bit too far for me to read the small text in the game. I can read everything well enough on the wide screen SD screen up close compared to 8 feet away on a 42-inch 1080p TV.

My biggest criticism of the game maybe the small text being unchangeable for TVs. Sit up close or play entirely on your gamepad to remedy. The Wii U gamepad maybe the best handheld Nintendo has ever made from the way I use it. I don't like handheld consoles, but in-home streaming from a beefier box somewhere to a comfortable controller w/screen is a wholenother story.

My biggest tip to learning how to play this game is to find someone who knows what they're doing and pick their brain. Monster Hunter Wikis are your best friend for charts for item combos, weapon crafting trees and armor crafting requirements. Don't know what something is or does, look it up! You could play the Wii version emulated on Dolphin for now or take it as a demo for what's going on in MH3U. The flexibility and functionality of being able to customize how you wish to play the game by altering what's displayed on your TV screen and Wii U gamepad while doing your missions is a testament of how in depth this game is. This game series is not for everyone. Tread lightly and keep asking questions.",positive

2. It takes forever to clear up the tunnel between the two towns.",positive
2963,"From the very beginning this game grabs you.  You're thrust into the role of Nariko as she awaits the closure of an epic battle over an ancient and powerful weapon held by her clansmen, the Heavenly Sword.  You immediately take control of Nariko with barely any instruction on what to do as hordes of enemies bear down on you.  On-screen cues quickly appear telling you to hit certain buttons at the right time and if you do so you are rewarded with fluid, fast combination attacks that are not only devastating to your foes but also beautiful in a frightening way.

From there the game just gets better.  The true fighting begins a few cutscenes later as you learn the backstory and pretty soon you find yourself in combat again...but this time your don't have the Heavenly Sword!  It's a bit dismaying at first, there are no great combos with the longsword you have, you can't juggle an opponent in the air or execute an aerial combo, there are no superstyle attacks, and you have only one fighting stance.  You can however still counter attacks for some beautiful displays of power.  Later you are thrust into the role of Kai, the archer and here you learn to master the art of ""Aftertouch"" using the Six-Axis controller (by far the best use of said feature and the most accurate).

You might think that the game plays much like Dynasty Warriors or Bladestorm, but you'd be wrong.  There is enormous variety in the combo attacks you can execute making the game nearly infinitely replayable.  You'll find yourself saying ""Oh My God"" the first time you see Nariko execute ""Blade of the Devil"", ""Stolen Kiss"", or ""Heaven's Spiral"" (trust me you'll have to play the game to get the full depth of these moves!).

And to make the game even more varied there are times when you are forced to use the Aftertouch feature (you have been practicing) to advance, whether it's annihilating catapults with a cannon or throwing a shield at a gong to trigger a gate, its a great way to make a player become more comfortable to what could otherwise be a major crux for the game.  Also the missions where you take control of Kai offer you a break from the hack and slash style of Nariko (not that you'll want the break, trust me).  There are even scenes where you must carefully press the analog stick in the right direction or hit the correct button in the correct sequence to advance.  Don't worry if you fail though, the sequences remain the same and you can easily get it the second time.  The one downside to it is that you are usually so busy watching the screen to see the cues that you miss the awesome action sequences Nariko is executing on your behalf!

GRAPHICS - ****
This game is incredible in 720p, though I would have loved to see Nariko in 1080p.
SOUND - ***
There isn't a lot to the sound, the musical score is beautiful however though with all the attention you have focused on Nariko and executing her moves you can easily miss it.
GAMEPLAY - *****
There is no doubt that you will likely become frustrated at points with the game (""why can't I get an aerial combo!"" is a common cry I hear from friends learning to play) but after a few hours of play you'll find yourself throwing dead bodies at your foes and smashing through a foe's shield with a devastating ""Angel's Fury"".",positive
2964,"The Good: Deeper more strategic fight system, game looks good, return of mini-games are a nice touch, the Krypt is a nice addition for fans

The Bad: Characters look like plastic dolls, blood looks too gelatinous, overall lack of content, boring arenas, most of the new characters are unlikable

Deadly Alliance was a turning point for the series. MK4 got mixed reviews from fans and critics and wasn't exactly what they wanted. Being only the second 3D Mortal Kombat game it was another reboot that took itself more seriously and became more complicated and deep. It featured three different fighting styles, long combo chains that you had to memorize, and gone were the days of fast button mashing. You now had to think ahead for your next move and strategize. It was the most robust and sophisticated fighting game ever made at the time, but it didn't come without its flaws.

Deadly Alliance was the first MK game to venture out away from just fighting in a core title. The team added a Konquest mode which is a giant tutorial on how to use every fighter and learn all their moves. This is pretty big for a fighter and can be a lot of fun. You follow Raiden down a long path across various MK worlds and learn about each fighter. They each have three different fighting stances; two regular and one weapon stance. That's not all though, these can combo into and out of each other for major damage. Characters with blade type weapons can impale their weapons into the opponent to make them bleed out, but they lose the weapon for that round. This more technical fighting style for MK had mixed reactions, but I like it a lot.

One thing I wasn't fond of were the lack of special moves and fatalities. There's only one fatality per character and a lot of them are mediocre at best. They aren't as gory or as awesome as previous games. Cyrax is missing his net move, a few characters only have 2-3 special moves, so it feels a weak. At least the mini-games make a return because they haven't been seen since MK1. A new Test-Your-Sight mini-game is added which is a cup and ball game. The team also added a Kurrency system and a Krypt to unlock costumes, videos, art, and interviews. I love this a lot and is a great fan service. However, once you unlock the entire Krypt there's not much else to come back to. Unless you are playing with a friend on the couch the game is just seriously lacking in single player content and is why I got bored with it after a couple of months.

The graphics were decent for the time, but the gore looks like balls of Jell-O and the characters look like plastic dolls. The women's breast physics look like swaying punching bags at 100 MPH even when you tap forward slightly. The sound effects are a bit weak and a few are recycled from MK4. The arenas are also kind of boring and many of them are new. The overall game is pretty solid but needed more polish. I also wasn't too fond of the new characters. A few were likable such as Frost, Nitara, and Drahmin, but all the rest just felt forced or rushed. I also didn't really like a lot of the redesigned characters such as Sonya and Johnny Cage. The character design is just really lacking here, but that could be just me being a picky fan.

Overall, Deadly Alliance is a nice change for the series and the more complex and strategic fight style may not be for everyone. The lack of content really hurts his game though, and it suffers from an overall lack of polish. It's still worth getting in your bargain bin for some couch time fighting.",positive
2965,Pretty neat guys,negative
2966,"First off, I loved the first game. It was extremely repetitive at times, but it was always fun to just wipe out thirty or so guys at a time once you had the majority of your powers. It's one of the few games where you actually felt like you were playing someone with super powers. I also really liked the story and characters.

That being said I just didn't get the same five star enjoyment out of Infamous 2. In the first game you might have been able to wipe out a hundred lackey npcs at a time, but when you got to the boss characters you had some challenge. I never felt challenged in this game. If I died it almost always had to do with me getting stuck somewhere or because of the camera controls. Those same things happened in the first game, but I was having enough fun that I didn't notice as much.

Pros:
* It looks great! I played the first one twice, and then played through again right before Infamous 2 came out. So I noticed the difference pretty immediately. The environment and npcs just look noticeably better.
* Far less buggy. The first game was REALLY buggy. I constantly fell through the world, got stuck, and couldn't jump to things I should have been able to which would cause me to fall. This is still a bit of an issue, but not so much.
* You start off with your travel abilities. Easily the worst part of the first game was not being able to quickly get from one place to the other. Not an issue this time.
* It's still fun. I would say the game play itself is more fun than the first one. You are much faster, the fights are bigger, and so on. The story was also pretty decent.
* The side missions are so much better in the game. They are actually fun and not nearly as repetitive.

Cons:
* You lose your abilities from the first game. I don't understand why they did this. They let you import in some of it, but otherwise you basically get your travel ability and standard run and gun abilities. Why not just keep most of them and then add the Ice and/or Fire abilities?
* The replacement abilities are worse. For whatever reason the replacements for the abilities you lose from the first game are so much worse. They have far less power and instead of adding power with each level you get new abilities instead. So, where as before you had grenades then leveled them up to be more powerful and then leveled them up so they would automatically capture enemies. Now each level does something different so you have to switch them constantly for different situations. That's cool with some of the powers, but some should have just powered up.
* The hero edition is not worth it. I never used the abilities given in this version, and that's the only reason I bought it. I guess if you really want a cheapo bag and an action figure it might be worth it.
* You lose the ability to power up on power lines. Honestly, I don't know what they were thinking here. Easily the most annoying part of this game is constantly having to stop and power up. I guess I never noticed it in the first game since I was always going from power line to power line.
* It was too easy. I was powerful in the first game, but at least there were bad guys who nullified that a bit. Not so here.
* Boring enemies. In the first game you had the three gangs with significantly different powers. Technically you could say the same here with the monsters, militia and ice guys, but it just wasn't the same. The monsters all looked the same and took no effort to kill, the militia was a joke, and the ice guys were just annoying with their jumping around everywhere. That and it was really the same guys over and over again. Some variation would have been nice. Also, the gang fights were soooooo much better in the first game.
* Ridiculous decisions. In the first game I had trouble choosing right from wrong. Save your girlfriend or the bus full of children type of thing is actually difficult, but in this game it was just ridiculous. The evil girl Nix is so over the top for no real apparent reason. Hey Cole, would you like to gain their trust by bringing them medicine, or enslave them under and iron fist of terror by murdering everyone in a 20 block radius? I would just laugh at her option every time. Especially when they revealed how she got her powers. It made no sense that she would want to hurt innocent people.
* While the new city looked much better I didn't like it as much as Empire City. It seems far more flat. It's based on New Orleans, and I don't understand why they felt that the city had no sky scrapers or anything. I've been there a ton of times and it's like they just took the french quarter and the swamp and left everything else out.

Conclusion:
I know it may sound like I hated the game, but honestly, it was pretty great. I think the base game play was so well done that the cons just stuck out like a sore thumb. Honestly, the only thing that really bothered me was the removal of charging on power lines. Things like the powers were no big deal since you just picked the best one and moved on, and since it's open world I was less bothered by the enemies because I had placed to explore. I just feel the first had a better super hero feel to it. I also wouldn't buy the Hero addition again if I had to do it all over.",positive

2968,"PSN ID GremDUDE. Never have I seen a design so dumb as a stop button which kicks you back to the XMB. SUre, for Netflix, it is pretty annoying but it doesn't take too long to reload and Netflix remembers the position of everything you watch. Blu-Rays do not for the most part so you will be in the middle of a movie, mean to hit the pause button and hit the stop button and suddenly you are back to the XMB. Not only do Blu-Rays not always remember where you are. Some have a bunch of non skippable previews and crap that you have to wade through to get back to where you were in the movie!! The odd thing is if you hit the circle key, you get an ""Are you sure you want to quit playback"" prompt. Guess what? You are never going to hit the tiny circle key by mistake. The big stop button? Yes you will hit it and hit it repeatedly. I recommend not having children in the room no matter what the rating is of the Blu-Ray you are seeing as you will find yourself cussing like a sailor at least three of four times per movie. ONe of the other reviewers suggested removing the stop button and I am a 100% believer in this. Grab a butter knife and pop the damn button before you pair it with your PS3!! You will thank me later. If you are worried about dust and dirt getting in the remote, a little piece of electrical tape will cover up the hole and not be too obtrusive looking. Once this is done, this remote is very good. The battery lasts FOREVER. It has buttons for all the controls on the dual shock and is pretty rugged and comfortable. My only other beef is mentioned by most people here. Touching ANY button on the remote will turn on the PS3. Make sure you place the remote somewhere where you won't hit it by mistake as you will have a PS3 that is always on.

The game is basically a ""Journey"" tale, meaning that there's no real town visiting and chatting with townfolk and visiting the stores. It's more like Lord of the Rings. A constant journey from point A to point B, with few pit stops along the way.

Did I like it? Not at first! Like I said, I was expecting something along the lines of past FF games, but once I got into it, and accepted that this was only Final Fantasy in name only, I really enjoyed it.

The other one I am on is HighSchool Musical 2 Playstation dance mat. And it was easy to get to the advanced levels. It easily bored me. If you are not a gamer, but like Wii for it's ability to get you 'healthier' then this is a good buy. I recommend putting some kind of holding fabric or wood board on the back of the mat. Mine moves a lot. And I do not want that as I want to get my footing on target and not be at an angle by the end of the song. That is definitely annoying. Also if you were disappointed with Dancing with the Stars for the Playstation then you will be thrilled with this. Causes it's ten times better. I just wish I could put my ipod music on it, and then wow. I'd be on it for ages. Decent music. But I loathe the way they dress the dancers.

Overall great game! I didn't give it a five stars cause we can't yet plug the ipod in and let it go. Otherwise to build up a sweat get this game. And it keeps a goal for the calories (if you like that sort of thing). Wouldn't it be great if we could take our ipod shuffles and just plug them into our Wii's with an easy cable or have a place on the side for an ipod shuffle to sit?

I was used to just fragging everything that moved and now I'm surrounded by all these nice little potential targets and i'm not supposed to kill ANY of them??!!??  Now i'm completely bored with the games that only requre a finger permenantly attached to the fire button to win.  Mass murder is good and all but it's definatly better to savor your kills and interrogate and force them to co-operate.  And it's good to be able to use a little strategy.

I liked the story a lot too.  It was very captivating compared to most of the games i've played recently.  The movies gave the game the sence of urgency and importance that make your missions seem worth while and rewarding.",positive
2977,The chrome color plastic was disapointing. Should have been actual metal not made to look like metal.,negative
2978,"If you played the first Dishonored then this will feel very familiar to you. I find overall that I can pretty much complete everything by simply sneaking around and using blink - much as I did in the first game (with some other abilities thrown in on occasion just for variety). This is an evolution in gameplay (not a dramatic revolution) although there are some nice improvements overall:

> Graphics have been enhanced as you would expect from the previous installment.
> There are new enhancements to abilities if you're playing as Corvo (and entirely new abilities if you're playing as Emily.)
> The world of Karnaca is brighter than the dark, gritty world of the first game.
> The levels are generally much larger than they were in the first game with lots to explore - but levels are still linear overall. This is not an open world game which would allow you to find quests and complete them at your leisure.

Personally, I enjoy the game quite a bit, but even so I'll get bored if I play it for a long time. I'll typically do a level or two at a sitting and come back later. Of course, I'm a bit of a completionist so I'm typically exploring every nook and cranny of each level which can take quite a while given the size of the levels.",neutral

---Story---

The story of FFXIV is initially told in the opening cutscene and is continued to be told as the player advances in missions, here's a breakdown of the story with the assistance of Wikipedia:

""Seeking control over the peaceful realm of Eorzea and its abundant crystal resources, the more advanced civilization of the Garlean Empire invades the realm from the north. In retaliation, despite their differences and anatgonisms, the city-states of Eorzea reinstate the Grand Companies--comprehensive centers of command which combine the cities' military and economic assets.

8th Imperial Legion Legatus Nael van Darnus, has his own agenda, insanely bent on purging all he sees as impurities, Nael orchestrated Project Meteor to summon the lesser moon Dalamud and wipe out all life. This forces the Grand Companies to put aside deep-rooted differences and consolidate their forces under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance. At the behest of this new confederation, adventurers from across the realm take up arms and march to the floating islands of Rivenroad to defeat Nael after he absorbed Dalamud's power. However, despite the mad imperial's death, Dalamud continues its descent to Eorzea.

In a final bid to save Eorzea, the Grand Companies turn to the Archon Louisoix, an enigmatic scholar hailing from the forgotten city-state of Sharlayan. Louisoix devises a plan to summon the power of the Twelve, Eorzea's pantheon of guardian deities, to banish Dalamud back to the heavens. But for this to succeed, the rite needs to be performed directly beneath the point of Dalamud's impact: A vast swathe of barren lowlands in central Eorzea known as the Carteneau Flats.

The battle ceases when Dalamud enters the atmosphere while revealed to be a prison created to contain the elder primal, Bahamut. Freed after aeons of imprisonment, Bahamut jump starts the Seventh Umbral Era while unleashing his wrath upon the realm.

Louisoix attempts the ritual to seal Bahamut in vain. Seeing his death certain in the Primal unleashing his ultimate attack, Louisoix summons the last of his strength to call upon the Twelves' power to send the survivors (including the player) into an ethereal rift, where they will be untouched by the passage of time, until it is once again safe for them to emerge and rebuild their ruined land.""

---Gameplay---

The gameplay is like most, if not all, MMORPG titles, the player can form parties, join guilds, run dungeons and participate in PvP. Of course, there are various trades the player can perform such as weaving, alchemy, blacksmithing and more, these offer items that might be harder to obtain otherwise and can earn you a nice sum of Gil for rarer items (if sold to players, NPCs offer little to nothing).

The player can freely* switch what class they are, you are not tied to one type. The exception being when you first start, you'll have to reach level 10 and complete your class quests in order to switch, from there you can join a new guild and start working on that class (some skills earned from the previous classes carry over to your new class, but more on that later).

Once you've reached level 10, you can join Guildhests, which are essentially mini dungeons. If you are level 10 in a trade, you can take Guildhests to earn exp and Gil that will help you level faster in said class. Upon completing the required quests, dungeons can also be entered (the first is available at level 15).

---Graphics---

The graphics look pretty good considering how much of a hiccup the first version went trhough. Although since the game is also on the PC, and therefore made FOR the PC, the PS3 version does tend to suffer a few graphical errors, such as the rare bug of enemies not appearing properly on screen, or party members seemingly disappearing despite them being right in-front of you.

When using the chat feature, characters mouths will move with your text, so this is a minute detail, but one that I find pretty cool non-the-less. Facial expressions are well-done as well, so be sure to try them out when you get the chance to do so.

The game has had a nice over-haul since it originally released some years ago, the new graphics engine shows quite well on many characters and skill effects.

---Controls, Voice and Audio---

The controls on the console are a tad tough to learn at first, so I'll try to run them down as thoroughly as possible.

The Cross button is your selector, although since you likely won't have a cursor to use (although you can opt for that), you'll need to be looking at the person you want to talk with, although the game is pretty good at figuring out what you're trying to do.

The Triangle button is simply used for jumping, so there's no need to go into depth on that, it is what it is.

The Circle button allows you to deselect your current target and cancel out of various menus. Simple.

The Square button allows for quick access of the map, which will be very handy when doing quests as the location of various monsters, items, etc will be shown on there.

The d-pad is used to cycle through enemies and friendlies, it takes some getting used to in order to 'master' using it.

All of these buttons take on a different role when either of the R2 or L2 bumpers are held, this brings up your hotbar for skills, items, etc that you may have registered to those slots (they also your the d-pad, so in total you'll have 16 available slots, but you can also have more than one hotbar, so cycling through them gives even more options). Confusing? Undoubtedly, however the games tutorial runs you through the basics quite well.

As any Final Fantasy fan can hope to expect, the music is well performed, during standard battles, you may recognize the music (it's more reminiscent of the older games on the NES, SNES and such). When riding a Chocobo, as well as other mounts I would assume, you are treated the Chocobo music. Music in town and on the field are quite elegant and, to some degree, soothing and rhythmic.

Voice acting is scarce, the intro and small cutscenes are the only place they really occur at, but they are done well when they are done. The only other time you get to hear voices is from the various grunts that characters make, so don't expect much when it comes to voices.

---Other---

As I mentioned earlier, you are not restricted to one class and can switch once you've completed your current classes level 10 class quest (you usually get a quest at level 1, level 5, level 10 and so on). The classes you can choose from are many, from fighting classes (such as Gladiator, Pugilist, Arcanist and many more) to trades (such as Weaver, Alchemist, Blacksmith, etc). The latter are, as you may have guessed by the term 'trade' non-combat classes and are used to make armor, potions and other nick-naks that can be used by combat classes. When you start a new class, you revert to level 1 within your new class but retain the level in the previous class, so returning to your previous class will allow you to continue where you left off at.

The game has what are called 'Fates', if you've played Rift, they are like rifts, randomly generated missions where you and other players work to meet a goal, generally killing a certain number of enemies. The more you contribute, the larger your exp and Gil reward will be.

There are also unique chats called 'Linkshells', which can consist of up to 128 players that are not necessarily a guild or friends, but can use the chat feature to chat solely with each other and no one outside of the Shell can read your chat, it's basically a giant party chat.

Most of the negativity that has been generated was during the beta, people would complain that servers were constantly down or laggy, this has since been rectified and almost all of the game works as intended. If you see a review that says otherwise, look at the date, anything prior to Sept 13th is unreliable.

And yes, this is a subscription based game, but you get 30 days free.

---Overall---

This is a great MMORPG that has a lot to offer and much to do. With free expansions coming, this is a must have for fans of Final Fantasy or MMO's. I know I'll be cancelling my WoW sub so I can enjoy this great game.

9.0/10.0

Pros

+ An all-around great MMO
+ Great music score
+ Interesting class system
+ Guildhests are a fun way to level up quickly
+ Linkshells offer a great way to stay in touch with people you like, but not enough so that you want to add them as friends or join their guild

Cons

- Picking an enemy out of the crowd is sometimes unbearable
- Gold spammers are plentiful
- If you don't have a keyboard, typing is a hassle

2986,"I purchased mine at a retail store, but wanted to inform potential purchasers that it's a great accessory for the Vita.

Great backup battery!  Excellent fit in the hands!  Highly recommend if you think the Vita is uncomfortable and difficult to hold.  FYI: You have to remove the grip to replace Vita games.  All other connections are accessible.",negative
2987,"I have been a Clive Barker fan for a while now. Owning several of his books and having seen the entire Hellraiser series, I had developed a taste for his work. It was relief to find something as sadistic as I was looking for, which I found in Hellraiser, after having been immensely disappointed with Michael and Jason and Freddy, so Barker gained my loyalty with his infamous creation.

Now that his video game, Jericho, is out, I finally managed to get my hands on a copy and just beat the game. First off, the graphics are great- one of the better next gen games I would say, certainly wiping the floor with Resistance: Fall of Man (I thought). The environments were great and the lighting fantastic, and the characters and creatures models were repulsive but demanded close attention. The framerate never slows down, making for smooth gameplay and frantic action. All seven characters have their own distinct psychic powers, ranging from the ability to control a bullet to possession. Some of these are more useful than others- Black's Ghost Bullet was definately my favorite, while Jones's possession ability is completely useless except in the situations where you have to use it. Cole's Time Warp ability, while I didn't use it often, was pretty neat, but it was her increased firepower ability that made her useful, as well as her weapon that would identify an enemies weaknesses. Rawling's life drain ability is, for all intents and purposes, worthless.

Which brings me to my next point. While your squad mates aren't totally stupid, they're not the brightest, either. They stay right in the path of fire and when an exploding enemy dies right next to them, rather than run away from it, they stand right there and let the corpse explode, which more often than not kills them and requires you to stop what you're doing and revive them. It gets frustrating at first but after a while you kind of get used to it.

I loved this game. And I will say, the cutscene before the final battle shocked me- let's say teammates go boom. Amazing.

Overall, great game. The AI is only a minor complaint compared to all the fun I had with the game.",neutral
2988,"Works surprisingly well! Play Half-Life 2 or other Valve game for a bit to get the feel. It is not a simple ""pick up and play"" controller. It is for the PC crowd who's used to configurations.

If you like Anime like claymore or attack on titan, you might like this.

The game is immature, hilarious, dark, gore filled, and your main character is a total Bee eye tee see H.  Your companion is a baby dragon who you Cuss at and threaten all the time.  Sounds bad but it's freaking hilarious.

2990,"This game is great except for this one problem. Took me maximum 25 minutes to beat the game.

2991,"So I played Blood Money a lot. To the point where I had fun coming up with different ways of tackling the missions. The game didn't punish you too hard unless you upped the difficulty.

In the other games the difficulty was raised to 11. For me, it definitely was like playing a different game. Especially when you don't have dead body storage or knock out syringes that work indefinitely.

Suggestion, play the second game first if you want a good idea how this game is supposed to play and ignore the first game. The first game on my computer did not work properly, mainly due to frame rate jumping through the roof. I believe Vsync fixed the issue, but I can't be too sure, since I have done some mucking about in the system settings which I do not recommend to a casual player.

If you ever want to get some fun out of the first game, play it first, but remember it could ruin you for the later games.",negative

So for her birthday I sought this game out for a good used-game price. You know how much it costed new with no book at Gamestop? Fourty Dollars incuding tax. Yeah... I'm not paying that for a beaten up old game with no book. So I looked online and found a New/Like-New copy and wrapped it for her birthday. IT had everything, The cards, the book, the crisp new game smell, and she hasn't stopped thanking me.

This game is worth it for a little kid as long as you can get it for a good price. It is a tad rare and hard to find, but it is a fun challenge to feed a pinata and raise your little farm.",positive
2995,"In 1998, Hideo Kojima single handedly changed the scope of gaming with one game: Metal Gear Solid.  Within Metal Gear Solid, there were ten VR Missions.  Surprisingly, people spent a lot of time with these VR missions, trying to clear them as fast as possible and honing their skills.  When word of this got out, Konami developed Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions.  A game that consisted of nothing but VR missions for the gamers that wanted them.

If anyone expected any story out of VR Missions, you'd probably wonder what they were thinking, because VR Missions doesn't have a story.  The game is exactly what it says it is: VR Missions.  Metal Gear Solid VR Missions consist of over 150 missions.  At first you can only do very basic missions, including the same ten that were included in Metal Gear Solid.  As well as training with weapons.  The more missions you complete, the more that will open up, including missions that can get into the bizarre, like fighting a giant soldier and super soldiers.

In terms of variety, Metal Gear Solid VR Missions does a great job.  There are so many different varied missions here to keep you busy.  You'll also be able to unlock the Ninja and a couple of other secrets, although, none of these things is very lucrative.  While it's great to play as the Ninja, the controls are a little sloppy, and there are only three incredibly short missions.  As I said, however, there are a ton of VR Missions here to keep you busy for a long time.

Visually, VR Missions is on par with the original Metal Gear Solid, the only real problem being that they didn't opt to create more different looking levels.  So much of the stages look fairly generic, save for a few missions where you'll find yourself in some familiar looking areas from Metal Gear Solid.  You can only stare at virtual space for so long.  Much of the music sounds very good though.  While the soundtrack isn't exactly huge, it plays a good part in letting the player know that through and through this is not an action game.  It is definitely a puzzle game.

There are two things about Metal Gear Solid VR Missions that can cause some alarm, though.  The first being that many missions are fairly short, meaning that this game only really serves as an expansion of Metal Gear Solid.  It's a mystery why Konami didn't just start packing it in with the original game after a while.  It never really happened.  The second huge problem is that the game advertises that it has 300 missions.  What they don't mention is that many of those missions are the same.  You'll undergo one mission and then be expected to do it again in a Time Attack.  To the developers this serves as two different missions, but it's the same mission.  The only difference is that you'll be doing it with an additional challenge.

As a puzzle game, Metal Gear Solid VR Missions is fantastic.  It gets repetitive having to do some of the same missions over and over, and it may only really just be an expansion of one of the bonuses in Metal Gear Solid, but it still serves as a fantastic game for those who crave to do more VR Missions.",positive
2996,"As a more ""unrealistic"" racing game enthusiast this really peaked my interest. It has extreme neck breaking speeds, sharp curves, and plenty of destruction. It really has lived up to the expectations of the franchise in my opinion.

-You can see other players on the map and race them head to head on the fly
-Plenty of car upgrades and the ability to unlock more including pursuit tech
-Rather large map that is open world",negative
2997,"BioShock is a game from game developer 2K. I'll give it the fact that is a very interesting concept for a game. It takes place in the 1960s, and there is a zombie appocalypse in the underwater city of Rapture. The game is fun and all, but it is very hard. Not only that, but the large world of Rapture is very confusing to me. There are many doors and crevises throughout the area. For a game that came out in 2007, this is an extremely fun game. One of my favorite abilities is the ability to hack enemy equipment to make it yours. For instance, if there is an enemy turret, you can hack it to make it yours. It will then kill enemys. This isn't your average Zombie game. Its not just shoot and run. There is an actual goal to the game. Although it can get pretty hard at times, I completely recommend this game for anybody that is looking for an interesting thriller of a game. I give it 4. Get it.",positive

Yes, being a Star Wars Fan, I had to have this game, yet it has been a small let down.  I gave it a four out of five more graphics than playability. It really is about a 3.8/ 5 but I get tired of seeing all the fake reviews prior to this last week when the game came out.  Don't beleive half of what you read on these reviews.

3007,"Before I start writing this review, I just wanted to say that I've never played the GameCube version so, I won't be comparing the two.

THE PROS:
=It's surprisingly addictive! It started out with me just renting it, two weeks later, I was purchasing it so I could play it longer without having to pay to extend the rental time. I've played through the entire game 3 times and it still doesn't get old.
=There's lots of possibilities in this game. You can run your farm and life how you want to; marry the girl you want, be friends with who you want, choose the way you want to make your riches.
=Expand. As you make money, you can buy extra stuff to put on your farm, either to decorate it or give it a function that it didn't previously have.
=Nice soundtrack. Though it's just instrumental stuff, it's mostly happy music that you can't help but smile when you hear some of the tracks.

THE CONS:
=There's moments where you will run different speeds depending on location and time of day. The game somehow speeds up a little down near Cody's house in the midday, making you run/ride at a faster than usual pace. Also, you seem to run/ride slower around the spring area any time of day.
=Loading screens and exiting & entering buildings takes several seconds and can sometimes just be more of a personal frustration than a practical one. Days where I'm relaxed in-real-life, I don't mind the waiting times, other days it bugs the crap out of me.
=Having vibration on makes your character pause for a second after jumping over the pasture fence. Don't know why, but it does.
=The colors aren't as bright and vivid as I would like them to be, but it's not really a con, just a personal preference.

The cons aside, this is still one of my favorite games. I didn't think I'd like such a game, but it's definitely something that everyone should try playing just once.",negative

3012,"I'm a huge racing game fan, and have been playing them since Gran Turismo on PS1. I can safely say that this is the best racing game since Gran Turismo 3.

Forza Motorsport 6 has a massive amount of content, ranging from its various game modes to its huge roster of cars. More importantly, the handling model is fantastic. I had so much fun during my first three days with the game that I spent $600 on a G920 racing wheel with a Wheel Stand Pro. Since then, I have done at least 50 laps around Nurburging in various cars, completed Campaign, and raced for hot laps in multiplayer.

3013,"Yes,the dvd remote for the ps2 is excellent,but I am writing this review to inform other ps2 owners as well as dismiss some myths. There seems to be alot of conflicting information from diffrent reviewers....
First and most importantly,the dvd remote does not have a power button for one simple reason;you MUST turn off the back switch when you are done playing your ps2 for the day(like when you are ready to go to bed)The ps2 SHOULD NOT be left on stand by mode every night for 8-10 hours. Doing so will result in the parts burning our faster because the machine never has a chance to shut
down. The only way you can damage your ps2 by turning off the back
switch,is if you repeatedly shut off the back switch but plan to play later the same day. In other words,if you plan to play the ps2 later during the day,but want to do something else,it is okay to put it in standby mode. Just remember to shut off the ps2 completely before you go to bed each night.
Secondly the review posted by ""bigsojoe2"" is extremely inaccurate;watching alot of dvds on your ps2 DOES NOT wear the system out. You can watch as many dvds as you like as often as you
like. The ps2 reads all the ps1 games,ps2 games,dvds and cds with the same laser that is capable of doing so. I even called the sony
help line twice to dispell this rumor. Both workers sounded suprised and even kinda laughed when I told them about the dvd wearing out story. I own 2 ps2s,and I bought one of them during the first year of it's release(watching many dvds on it since) and all of it's diffrent functions work properly.

3021,"For years now I've thought my typing skills had diminished down to nothing, but now I realize it was just because the keys on most keyboards are flat and close together, which makes it very hard to tell if your finger is halfway on another key.  No such problem with this one though, the keys have a good separation between them and you can really feel them under your fingers.  My typing errors have dropped to next to nothing!  And then there's that beautiful clicky sound that takes me back to the days of my youth.  It's not a sharp sound, it's just a nice plastic clicky  noise.

The keyboard is lit with red illumination, with two buttons to control the light intensity.  One button affects only the W, A, S, D and arrow keys, so if you want you can have those lit up while the others aren't illuminated.  The other button controls the light intensity of all the other keys, and of course you can press both at the same time to control the lighting on the entire keyboard.  There are four illumination levels, plus no illumination at all.

I haven't used it for gaming as I use my Xbox 360 for Windows controller for that, but if it's anything like typing, it must be excellent.  There's also a plug in for your headset and a 2-into-1 adapter cable is included for that as well.

The wist rest on the front is detachable so you don't have to use it if you don't want.  It snaps firmly into place if you do want it.  The keyboard is pretty heavy overall and there's no chance of it moving around while using it.

3023,"This game is great fun, and that is what counts. It feels like playing tennis. The presentation of the game is very well done.

Some of it can be difficult. Especially some of the training mini-games are tough. But this doesn't seem to get in the way of overall gameplay too much. Also, for some reason I really seem to have a problem aiming with one of my characters, but not with the other, despite the fact that the problematic character seems to have better (or at least equal) stats.

Nevertheless, this is a good game. I can recommend it. I have probably played this game more than any other PSP game.",positive
3024,"this game i rented as a bit of a lark. i expected it to be sony throwing some money at a developer to give them an answer to prototype. after renting it and playing it for 3 of the 5 days i rented it for. i bought it. and once i finished it, i gotta say it's one of the best games i've played in years and the story is hands down my favorite story in a video game since the next gen consoles hit. and that is saying something.

the powers you get are tons of fun and the mobility powers make it really easy and fun to get around the city, think assasins creed meets tony hawk.

we've been inundated with morality choice games so it doesn't show as well as it should but the good vs bad choices are very well done. being a good guy is difficult at times but it's not an excercise in takeing shots to the nuts like with other morality games, and being a bad guy still has the juicy goodness of an evil overlord. being good or bad affects your powers, one or the other isn't better or worse it's more a choice of your playstyle, as an evil electric villain you cause massive splash damage and explosions with every attack. as a hero your powers are more focused and return life and energy with most of your strikes and even restrain enemies automatically.

overall a great game, i've regretted buying my ps3 except the blu ray player till playing this game. it's really great.",neutral

3032,"Perfect Dark is a simply amazing game. I know... I'm writing this almost 5 years after the game came out, But I assure you i beat the game years ago. I was rummaging through some old games several hours ago when I rediscovered this gem. To think, I had almost forgotten how good this game was. Sure, compared to Games like Doom3, Half-Life 2, Halo 2, and Golden Eye Rouge Agent, this game has horrable graphics, but this is very easily overlooked. The story is engrossing, the weapons are fantasic, and the multiplayer is the best thing since online play. The controls take some getting used to (I've been spoiled by these controlers with two thumb sticks lol), and the N64 controls are a little too sensitive for this game (corrected by some auto-aiming functions), but you will get over this. The guy before me (who wrote his review 4 years ago...) isn't entirely right. Is the game difficult? yes. Is it impossible? no. I beat the whole thing on medium difficulty and got half way through hard before finially retiring the game (I hope to one day beat the whole game on hard though). The game will actually require you to practice if you want to beat those higher difficulties (thats why there are tons of training ops, and a combat simulator), and you will have to try missions over. The game is not nearly as hard as you may be led to believe (If you want it to be though, the game can be set on some insainly hard difficulties... we're talking about so difficult, that they could be concived as a cruel joke rather than a difficulty level... but thats only if you want to set the game this high.) The game offers so much variety, you will hardly get bored with single player, and enough customization options for multiplayer, that it rivals most modern games (which is pretty sad). From stealth, to hostage rescue, to defense, to assault, to reconance, to assassination, to infiltration, there are so many things you will do in single player. I some how get a feeling that this review will never be read, but if by some chance your wandering eyes glance over this review, and you are still the proud owner of an N64 with and expansion pack, then believe me when I say that if you find this one, you can't afford to not pick it up. This remains one of my all-time favorite games... don't miss it.",negative
3033,good,positive
3034,"It's been a long time since an RPG has really held my interest, and I think the reason why this game really succeeds is because of its really great cast of characters. Even the weakest one of which is fun to troll with by choosing the funny conversation choices, and I really like how they each say things from time to time just while you're walking around in the dungeon. It adds a lot of flavor to the game.

The gameplay is also very good, as well--it takes the Eye of the Bee-holder formula of the hallway-walking RPG and adds a few interesting new twists on it, which thankfully includes a mapping system. Yes, you have to draw your own map, but I find it a lot of fun! There are tons of secrets and hidden passages, so it makes perfect sense to allow players to annotate their own map rather than letting the game do it for them. It feels much more satisfying that way.

There's also a Force Meter, that acts like an Overdrive from other RPG's. Plus, your characters will also randomly create ""Grimoire Stones"" during battle (I imagine them laying them like eggs). Grimoire stones essentially contain copies of moves or abilities owned by the character or the monster they're fighting, and equipping them will either grant that ability or power up an existing one. It's an interesting and intuitive way to truly customize your party, and it gets even more interesting once you start trading them with NPC's and such.

The skills your party learn are governed by a skill tree, which is exactly as complicated as it should be. Every level you get to spend a skill point in one of your skills. When you level certain ones up enough, it unlocks more skills. Easy peasy.

In conclusion, everything about this game makes total sense, and nothing feels tacked on or extraneous. I'm only about 18 hours into the game, and the plot so far is sort of ho hum, but the way it's presented is great. The music is groovy and I keep getting it stuck in my head, and the challenge level is pretty decent. Great game, I look forward to playing the others in this series!",positive
3035,"I've had an XBox 360 for over 6 months, and can say beyond a doubt that I really don't like the Microsoft console. It is too noisy, very hot and I had to have it repaired for the ""3 rings of death"" problem everyone else has. I mean I played Nascar '08 with the sound turned up and could still here the XBox 360 DVD drive churning!

I recently bought the PS3 40GB model because I want to start watching Blu-ray on my HD TV and play some of the PS3 only titles. What a pleasant surprise. The PS3 is so quiet, I can consider keeping it running when not doing anything. Blu-ray videos are a real treat and the PS3 doesn't feel like someone turned on a space heater when it is powered up.

While I was disappointed that I can't play my PS2 titles on it, the PS2 is still here, so that's not a big deal.

Finally, having Playstation Network free of charge is great. It isn't as good as XBox Live in some ways, but Sony keeps improving it. For the price, it is a great value add.

3042,"where to start.. Gearbox has delivered on nearly every front possible with Borderlands. gameplay is extremely polished, a blast to play with controls similar to Call of Duty and near perfect hit detection for bullets/melee.

comparisons to Fallout 3 are inevitable given the RPG/FPS fusion in a post apocalyptic setting, but both excel in their own areas. where fallout delivers a deep RPG experience in a massive, fully explorable wasteland with some questionable gunplay - Borderlands is more shooter focused, with 4 player co op and more polish on the FPS gamplay with mild character progression/exploration. not to mention hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of guns for your arsenal. everything from damage level/rate of fire/recoil/clip size/reload speed to elemental add-ons including fire/explosive/acid/electricity/ect varies between guns. you're almost constantly finding new gear thanks to the revolutionary random content generation system based on your level.

when starting a new game you must choose 1 of 4 characters. a fast, stealthy female character - the extremely accurate sniper (deadly at long range) - the well rounded soldier character - and the tank, a beast in almost any combat situation. each character has their own advantages in battle, and a unique special attack. specials vary between a shielded turret, invisibility, an attack hawk, and berserk mode. the unique feeling of each character adds tons of replay value to an already lengthy game.

the campaign plays out similar to an open world rpg, tavelling from place to place, picking up new quests and loot along the way.

the cell shading graphics offer a unique flare not often seen in games, especially shooters. it may not have the detail of a game like Gears of War, but its got its own unigue style that looks great considering the size of the game and th amount of content.

vehicle controls are very similar to those of halo 3, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your taste.

dont get me wrong, i still hold Fallout as the best game of 2008, but if you liked the ideas behind Fallout 3 and were pushed away by the questionable gunplay or the depth of RPG character progression, Borderlands may just be the game for you. its a more accessable, more polished rethinking of the RPG/FPS fusion.

3045,"Not that there's anything wrong with the other game systems out there on the market, or is there? Despite the recent intervention of X-box and before that with Playstation, Nintendo has risen to the challenge presented by Sony and Microsoft to prove that not everyone is interested in bigger, better, faster and uglier. Nintendo has formed a franchise, much the same way Disney has and is now part of our cultural language. The characters we know the stories we love and the game, though basic in design appeal to us because there's a history and quality there. The Nintendo Game Cube, the most recent addition to the Nintendo family of consoles, will amaze you. The Nintendo simply does more with less than the other two systems. If you're struggling to decide how to spend your hard earned money just rent the systems or go over to a friends how and see the difference between them. The conclusion I came to was that the Nintendo offers more for less. You'll be able to afford more games and have more fun with the games that are offered. If you're struggling with the fact that the Playstation plays DVDs, know this, it is not by any means a good DVD player, meaning it doesn't relay the quality nearly as well as other DVD players. Buy Nintendo for the games and buy Sony if you have the means for two systems. As for the third option, who really wants to help Microsoft invade yet another market.",neutral

3047,"I've been meaning to buy a Japanese PlayStation 2 for 15 years, and prices are finally low enough that I was able to do so.

This device functions perfectly when attached to an American television and power. This is the slim model, and honestly I prefer the slide-out disc drive of the oversized original, but it's small, it's quiet, and it works.

American controllers also work fine with this machine.

I've tried to use the disc swap trick and could never get it to work. I'm not fond of modding hardware. I suggest if you want to play Japanese games that you obtain one of these and hook it up to your TV for the authentic experience. It used to cost between 200 and 300 dollars for one of these when I was a teen, but they are now less than a hundred dollars.

Pick one up, buy all the games you want that never came out in the U.S., and then grab some grab games that DID come out in the U.S., but are ridiculously overpriced in the U.S. and dirt-cheap in Japan.

I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend picking one of these up if you are interested in playing Japanese import PS2/PS1 games. There has never been a better time to be a retro gamer and buy imports.",positive
3048,Thanks the PSP works great and is fun to play.,positive
3049,"To Start off the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars is because you are not able to have more than one game save at a time or at least as far as I can tell. Also I didn't install something when I first started the game (Someone was distracting me) and now I'm not able to host a game.

EDIT: I have notice that I have not updated this review, so I have figured out that you can have more than one user on the PS3, making it possible for more than one person to play a game (Sorry but Sony really surprised me with this one). As for hosting a game somehow I managed to figure that out as well. I have also change from 4 stars to 5 stars.

Resident Evil 5 is more challenging than the 4th one was and with two players you can have either someone sitting next to you or someone half way around the world, a great improvement. There can be times when this seams like a bad ideal when you just play with the AI, but with online it makes a big improvement.

Resident Evil 5 has a good variety of levels, from a small village in Africa to ruins of an ancient city in a cave. The graphics are awesome in HD, the game was little shorter than I had hoped for, was wish it was like the first one in length. However, with online play it makes up for it. Just as with Metal Gear Solid the controller setting have been changed, for the time being I have been using the settings for Resident Evil 4 but will change once I get the hang of the game to increase difficulty.",positive

There was one quest, something about finding the baron wife that ended up with no location marker and said something about looking at other clues in Velen, it ended up meaning to do the other main quest, that one was confusing, it should be fixed.

The text caption is indeed small, maybe make it a little bit bigger and have the green triangle option (on PS4) for turning on/off subtitles could be an improvement.",negative

3054,"Like a lot of games with an online community, it usually comes down to the community and the longevity that makes you keep coming back. What makes Fat Princess unique is that its a multiplayer that you've most likely never seen before and helps it stand out from all the FPS shooters out there. While it initially had a shaky start with bad servers and disconnects, now it's become quite fun in its own right. The basics of the game are very simple, you'll get the hang of things supremely fast and instead of the multiple pages showing you how to play, eventually you'll understand everything and even figure out your own tips to your advantage. But my suggestion is to use a mic because the whole thing about Fat Princess is communication, teamwork and coming up with strategies but just don't be a jerk about it. Heh, what I mean is don't become an armchair general and order everyone to do what you want and get mad when you don't but if you team up with players and actually use your mics, it's a huge blast.

The goal behind the game is the titular character herself, a cute-as-a-button princess that craves cake. However, each team has the other team's princess locked up and its up to your team to rescue yours from the enemy base and prevent their team from rescuing theirs. Blocking your progress are castle gates which have to be destroyed in order to get in though there's other ways around which I'll get to. There's always what's called Snatch-and-Grab which is like Rescue the Princess but you do it 3 times and there's also a Team Deathmatch-esque mode which is basically the teams have a certain amount of kills you have to get to win the match and there's also a Soccer match which is exactly that though I rarely if ever see anyone on it.

Let's get down to the classes. Each class can be upgraded which will allow for a second and useful added ability. One of the primaries is the Soldier, a sword/shield user that is more-or-less the tank in the game with his upgrade being a halberd which has a nice dash attack. The Mage which can shoot fireballs or ice balls or do an AoE attack that burns/freezes enemies in the surrounding area. The Priest who is basically the healer though his upgrade is a bit different. He's actually a dark priest that locked on, saps health from enemies and an AoE attack which basically curses the players and skews their controls a bit. The Ranger is as expected the long range user with either a bow or a blunderbuss (shotgun) which can be lit on fire for extra damage (hit their weak spot for massive damage :P ). But the backbone of the team is the Worker, the resource gatherer if you will which is either the wood from trees or metal from rocks which are the source of your upgrades. The wood can also be used to build/rebuild damaged doors but also build ladders into enemy bases or the castle's catapult which propels teammates faster across the map or if you time it well enough, provides a speedier getaway for a team rescuing the princess.

That's really the gist of it though there's more. Why is it called Fat Princess when you first see her and she's actually quite short and tiny? Well that's where cake comes in as continously feeding her slices found in the map plumps her up (complete with deepening of voice) which makes it especially harder for the enemy team to carry her across the map. While it's incredibly useful and the more people ""escorting"" a princess, the faster they run so if she's skinny well, might as well give them a car while you're at it, the inherent problem comes in that teammates have to constantly feed her cake or she drops her weight supremely fast (if only that were so in real life, eh ladies?) and pretty soon your team might feel like ""screw it"".

Now the game is bright and colorful though it does got gore and blood which can be turned off in the menu but this is probably one of the more cuter violent games out there but the game's so fun and so chaotic that it's hard to get completely offended. As for gripes well, let's say you rescue the princess nearly the same time they've taken yours back. Normally if it was just one then there'll be a timer and if the other team hasn't at least grabbed her, then match over but if it happens where everyone has their princess back well matches can go on forever as everyone camps their team's princess and matches can take almost way too long to actually finish. Also, let's say you're a Priest and you want to heal a Warrior who is doing well on battle but his health is really low. With all the chaos you'll be in, it's hard to target that ONE specific character and many times a teammate will die because you kept healing the fully healed Ranger that was beside him. And there's still occasionally the server problem where you leave a match, join match and get put into the same match or can't find one but generally it's way better than launch.

If you want a fun multiplayer that's accessible and way different than the Call of Duty's and Gears of the world then Fat Princess works really well. And Titan Studios does do patches which not only help the game but add new maps. But would've been nice if that Ninja and Pirate classes were real. WTF, Titan?!",positive

3056,"Wonderful Game! If you are a Star Wars fan, you have to buy this game. DICE did a great job designing the weapons, characters, vehicles, and especially, the maps :D. You are able to fly the X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Millennium Falcon, Slave 1, and other fighters. They are so many modes that you can do in this game. My favorites right now are Walker Assault, Heroes Vs. Villians, and Fighter Squadron. The gameplay is pretty good. There was nothing negative about it. Everything was just right for me. They even display your buttons to use for HAND feature. The hand feature are like grenades, extra weapons, jetpack, and including special perks like Focus Shot, Ion Shot, and other great ones. The ranking system is not that bad at all. It was super easy to reach level 5 in the beta but after finishing up the full version, the ranks got little harder to reach. I like that way because we can enjoy more with Star Wars Battlefront than trying to reach the top rank which was 50 I think. I am not sure there are prestiges in this game like COD. I have a feeling that they are using the same method like Evolve did which was disappointing for me because after reaching level 40, you were basically done with the game. The graphics are just out of this world. I can really feel that I am actually in the Star Wars Universe. My favorite map is Endor. They did a really great job on this particular because of the background noises from Ewoks and other creatures in the woods that makes the atmosphere more realistic. Overall the maps are pretty huge in Walker Assault mode but if you play small matches like Droid run, there will be only small matches with only like 12 players in a lobby. The only things I hated that DICE did not put in are in-game chats because forsure, they didn't want nobody talking trash, I guess. If you want to talk with friends, create a party chat and other thing I hated that there were no space battles. How are we suppose to call this game ""Star Wars"" if we are not in Space??? I mean DICE will definitely think about putting like clone wars and space battles in new DLCs including new heroes and villains.

Overall, I am super happy to grab the hard copy of this video game. I can't wait for DICE to release the new DLCs. They just announced that new characters will be in the game. Again, grab this game if you are true Star Wars fan and appreciate that DICE brought it back from 2005. We waited for ten years for this happen and I know that they release new Star Wars content like Star Wars Commando and other stuff that is related to Star Wars!",neutral

3066,"You are a federal agent who specializes in hunting down serial killers. You have a handy set of forensic tools with which to investigate crime scenes.

You are sent to investigate the latest murder by the ""Matchmaker killer"" and end up being framed for the murder of two police officers.

From here, the story unfolds in a twisted and dark fashion.

The setting is a decaying city where crime has drastically increased. Drug addicts, gang members and vagrants of all types are roaming the streets committing random acts of violence and mayhem.

Your mission is to clear your name by tracking down the man who framed you.

You will explore dimly lit abandoned buildings, subway tunnels, dark alleyways, service tunnels, an abandoned department store, and all sorts of scary and decaying areas. Your only source of light is a dim flashlight. Your only weapons are those that you find either hidden or items that you can literally rip off of the environment. You also have a kick that comes in handy more than you would think.

The levels are very detailed and very, very scary. Most of the level will consist of you searching through dark, dirty and grimy areas searching for clues or following the man who framed you, while drug addicts, gang members and vagrants roam the darkness searching for weapons to kill you with. These levels are dark! Your flashlight barely lights the way. The game engine produces amazing lighting and shadow effects which really set the mood. Textures and environments are absolutely stunning in their detail. Each level looks just like its realistic counterpart. Character models are well mapped and their movements are realistic.

Condemned: Criminal Origins is a true treat for your eyes.

And a treat for your ears as well. The high level of care that was put into the graphics has been put into the sound as well. Aluminum cans and glass bottles clank around when kicked or stumbled over, garbage shuffles and shifts under your feet, metal clangs when it hits the floor. An eerie soundtrack of ambient noise plays constantly through the game, which really intensifies the mood.

Sound is the dominant sense here. Since most of the levels are bathed in darkness, you will have to rely on your ears to sense whether an enemy is close. You can hear them cough and shuffle around - which is extremely creepy yet helpful.

Weapons consist of whatever you can find laying around. Pipes of all sizes, rebar,2X4's, shovel's, fire axes, sledgehammers, conduit pipes, crowbars and signs all pose as weapons which you can literally rip off of the environment and use on your enemies. Of course they can use them too, and often you will run into an enemy who will run away from you in search of a pipe or some kind of makeshift weapon to bash your skull in with.

Combat is fun, especially since you and your enemy have a block feature that works really well. Combat actually has some soul behind it as well, it not just button mashing. You have to strafe, stick-n-move and block (the enemy AI has good aim). The Enemy AI in general is very top notch and smart. They will flank you, take cover, run off to find more weapons, adn try to ambush you. They block your moves and react to each other as well. If a group attacks you and they accidentally hit each other, they will forget about you and try to kill each other - this leads to some interesting moments where you can just sit back and watch all of the enemies kill each other, doing all of the work for you.

You also have access to finishing moves (available when you have an enemy on their knees). They consist of: A headbutt, a finishing punch to their face, slamming their head into the ground, and snapping their neck.

There are more traditional weapons around (guns). You actually start off with a gun, however you soon lose it. There are handguns and shotguns scattered around the levels, some hidden. The only stipulation is that they are limited to the ammo that is already loaded into them, so don't expect to run around on an ammo hunt like in most games.

Since you ARE the federal agent, the point of view for this game is a First Person point of view. The game does really well of hardly ever breaking that view either, save for the cut scenes. If you get kicked down some stairs, your point of view does not change, and it seems like YOU actually got kicked down the stairs.

Your only point of contacts is a lab rat who analyzes the evidence that you find and gives you some tips at certain parts of the game, and a guy named Valhorn who somewhat helps you. They contact you via your cellular phone.

The game features a whole laundry list of achievements, from finding all of the dead birds and metal pieces in a level, to actually passing a level, to finding hidden XBOX 360 systems hidden throughout the game. You also get an achievement if you finish the game without firing a gun (you can use the guns as blunt objects also). No online features, however it would be hard to have some kind of multiplayer game without it getting boring fast.

Overall, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a very engaging game that should have you investing about 10 hours or so into it. There are 10 missions, about one hour per mission (this is considering that you are looking for the dead birds and the metal pieces, but not considering if you get lost enjoying the graphics of each level). Visually this game is a great representation of ""next-gen"" gaming, the gameplay is great and the sound is killer.

Condemned comes off as a very realistic game where you have to think before you move. You cannot defeat the game by running and gunning. Pacing  and nerves of steel are required for this game, as it will test both.

I really enjoy Condemned, graphically and in gameplay.",negative

orginally i own this on pc including sonic cd but i only played it on the pc once ' but now i can finally play it the easy way this game rocks the music is good richard jacques does a hell of a job ' with the music the game does not get boring even if you already unlocked all characters ' Its just one of those games that gives ya the feeling to race

Sonic The Fighters 7/10

I could be the only person who gives this a low rating but the game is good but not all that good their is frausration in the fighting stages especially when you try to unlock super sonic which i haven't yet due to the difficulty in unlocking him ' In my opinion just playing the game with a friend is better

Overall like i said before the collection is okay and i recommend it to long time sonic fans :)",neutral
3070,"These are probably the best wired headphones available for the Xbox One with added bonus that the boom microphone tucks away inside the ear piece so you can use the headphones while listening to music at home or on the plane. In terms of functionality, comfort, and sound quality these headphones are easy to recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of gaming headphones.

Functionally, these headphones offer a solid gaming experience and are easily versatile enough to become the ""go to"" headphones for a variety of listening situations.  If you are looking for a multipurpose headphone that will also work with the Xbox One, then the X300 is the way to go. The X300 is a good choice for Xbox One users, but if the Xbox One is the sole reason for purchasing headphones, your money will go farther with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ear-Force-Stealth-420X/dp/B00YXO5X4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ear Force Stealth 420X</a>&nbsp;.  The telescoping mic is a brilliant touch that keeps the mic handy when you need it, but allows these headphones to be perfect companions while travelling.

The intended use for these X300 is the Xbox One, and the arrived smartly packaged in an Xbox branded box.  The X300 comes with an adapter that is slightly smaller than the standalone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter</a>.  However just like the standalone adapter, the X300 offers channel volume control so you can adjust game volume independently of chat volume. The mic mute and headphone mute buttons are also conveniently located on the adapter. There is also a mic mute toggle located on the earpiece as well.

Friends noted that my chat voice was clear and easy to understand, although slightly less crisp than Turtle Beach's 420X. However since the X300's are hardwired to the controller, there was none of the lost signal that can (and does) occur with the 420X's.

Finally in terms of functionality, sometimes simplicity is best, and the case of local multiplayer games the X300 holds an advantage.  The X300 headphones plug into a controller and whoever is using the controller also uses the headphones. The wireless 420X's have an annoying problem of being ""assigned"" to a user that has signed in.  If multiple people are gaming together on one console, using the settings app to correctly assign the 420X is time consuming.  For couch coop sessions, the X300 and other wired headphones for guests is hands down the way to go.

These headphones have an ingenious headband system that basically allows the band to melt onto the users heads providing an unbelievably comfortable experience.  I wear glasses, and I struggle with ""too tight"" headphones because they apply too much pressure to my ears.  But too loose and the headphones will slide all over the place. I had my doubts about headphones that did not have a traditionally adjustable band.

Happily, I can report that this headband system is among the most comfortable and is absolutely the easiest to wear that I've ever experienced.  The inner band has very slight resistance as it expands to hit the wearer's head. On each side of the of the inner band are two retracting wires that provide the tension for the inner band. The four wires seem to be independent which allows the inner band to adjust to basically any sized head.  The rigid outer bands provide the squeeze that keeps the earpieces in place.  The weight of the outer band and earpieces is removed from the inner band by this ingenious halo system.  It feels as if almost nothing is resting on my head while the earpieces fit snugly.

The headband system coupled with the soft leather-like earpieces combine for a very comfortable headphone experience.

Finally no matter how comfortable or functional headphones are, sound is the most important quality.  The X300's provide deep bass as well as distinct highs.  The earpieces are designed well enough to significantly muffle exterior noise, while the speakers have enough volume to really allow you to exist ""in"" the game.  During a session of The Elder Scrolls Online the X300s really had a chance to shine: I could hear the distinct sound of nirnroot even while I was pretty far away. I had a foraging advantage with my headphones over relying on the TV's speakers.

The X300 provides a full set of features that gamers need while also offering quality sound and an unbelievably comfortable experience. The fact that users never lose the signal and they don't have to lose a USB port on the Xbox makes the X300 a strong contender against Turtle Beach's 420X. If you play lots of local coop games, or if you want to bring your headphones into other situations the X300s have a distinct advantage.",positive

3074,"First, for all the whining about DRM and SecureBlahBlahBlah, I have not had a single problem with install or running it. Of course, I haven't tried un-installing it yet, so who knows? :)

But the game is AWESOME, it pulls you in like watching a movie, and the details as you explore the ship are well thought out. All the Decks have extensive unique details, and the holographic overlay when you review your inventory or get video messages is brilliant!

If there is any complaint, the controls seemed to be sluggish, but I suspect that is by design since as your character gets weak, his aim degrades, he moves slower, and he starts gasping and bitching more.

For the BEST experience, put on a pair of headphones when you play. The ambient sounds are excellent and there are some soft voices that you won't really understand without a headset.",positive
3075,Very dood game. I love it along with Hawx 2,positive
3076,"Just want to throw my 2 cents in. I don't write many reviews but was compelled because I had a really good time playing it.

First and foremost, I LOVE the whole Demons/Gods and Mythology genre in general. I love Norse mythology, Chinese mythology, Christian/Judeo mythology, etc., so to play a game about The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the whole Angels and Demons thing (God of War, etc.) is a great joy.
And fortunately, THQ did not disappoint. If there was a 4.5 star rating I would give it that, because this game isn't one of the best out there, but it's pretty damn good.

PROS:

+ AWESOME art direction and style. Joe Mad did a great job designing the characters and overall theme and mood of this game. The coolest character in the game by far is Samael, who looks almost exactly like the devil from that Tom Cruise ""Legend (Ultimate Edition)"" movie. They NEED to make him as a playable character in the sequel!

+ Great storytelling. One of the strongest points of the game is it really draws you in. I love watching the cutscenes to find out what's going to happen next - it's almost like watching a good movie that you can control. That's the magic of good games nowadays. The whole betrayal/vengeance theme might be cliche, but it works. Couple good storytelling with great voice acting (Mark Hamil once again nails it as The Watcher - is there any quirky voice this guy CAN'T do?? Give the man an Oscar!), and you have a very spellbinding presentation.

+ LOTS of things to upgrade and discover. Just when I was about to fight the last boss and wane my interest, I go online to read up on the game and find out I can go find the Abyssal Armor, the Legendary Enhancements, and The Harvester Scythe (NOT the original scythe - get it FREE! Press START, go to OPTIONS, choose ENTER CODE, and type in ""The Hollow Lord"" without the quotes - enjoy!).

+ Like most games nowadays, you can finish the game once, then incorporate part of the old game into the new one. So when I return to it again on Apocalyptic difficulty (after I play my Mass Effect 2 and Dante's Inferno of course!), I'll have my Abyssal Armor, as well as my health leaching abilities from the old game - score!

CONS:

- Controls can be frustrating at times. The game has ""gravity"" - it doesn't feel light like other platforming games, say like Prince of Persia, and noticeably heavier than God of War III. So when you jump, sometimes you get that weighed down feeling, and sometimes it doesn't respond at all, which has killed me on several occasions - not jumping at the ledge and falling to oblivion.

- Camera/point of view can use some more tweaking. Yes, you can control the camera almost 360 degrees in all directions independently, but the viewpoint for certain ""scenes"" change depending on where you are, so sometimes in the heat of battle, when you step into another ""scene,"" it can throw you off and get you in quite of a bind. One trick you can try to help you is to hold down the Target Lock(L2 trigger), and it'll work most of the times, although sometimes it puts you in too far of a viewpoint to make furious button mashing efficient.

All in all this is a very good game that gets you hooked from beginning to end, only to find out there's a sequel in store - score! Whoops, hope that didn't spoil anything for you - enjoy!",positive
3077,"Before I bought AC I was interested in Ultima 9 which was a complete flop. Then, my brother had me play AC and one of the biggest things you notice are the graphics. Just clicking on the Life stone which saves where you will be teleport to is beautiful. All the magic is fun and most of the people are great. I recommend a video card that can support the modest graphic requirement. I think the ten dollar fee is accurate since the great people at turbin always update the game each month with new world events and climate to new armour, weapons, quests, and new lands. All of which you would have to pay for a new game completely anyways. But, with AC you never have to buy a new game because AC is always a new game each month =) I recommend this game if you want to be addicted I have been playing for 1 1/2 years and I don't plan on buying anything else until AC2 Thanks Turbin for a game you spent making for around  6 years I believe.",positive

I've been using this mouse for a couple days now and it's perfect.  Sleek and pleasing to the eye with the LED's glowing, absolutely comfortable for my hand/wrist, buttons are convenient yet not in the way so you won't accidentally click any buttons.  Sure it's expensive compared to a $5 - $10 mouse, but it's well worth the money with the dead-on accuracy of the laser and the top quality craftsmanship.  Cheers!  -Seldomane",positive

3082,"True- there is a TON of Hype surrounding this game due to Halo 1 selling 5 million plus. Everyone was eagerly anticipating Nov. 9 so they can spend their 50$ or 55$ on it. Bungie studios & microsoft are gonna make some HUGE profits from the sales! Some people stood in line for hours until after midnight to get this game. I am not one of them. Why not?...I will instead wait to hear all the reviews of the game first to make sure it's as good as all the marketing hype claims it is. I'm not one of the millions of sheep that stand in line or preorder the game just because it's coming out. The game isn't going anywhere and the price will only drop, people act like it's only being sold on Nov. 9 ! What's the sense in rushing to get a game that could possibly have bugs or simply isn't as good or better than the original?

3087,"Alright, here's the deal.  NFS: Carbon isn't the best racing game, and I'm not trying to say it is.  But, on its own merits, it's a great game.

Canyon racing is a nice little aspect of the game.  I almost wish there were more places that you could go off the edge at.  All boss races are decided by a final race on the canyon.  It's honestly not all that difficult.  As long as you don't royally mess up, chances are you won't lose, but by no means let that detract from the fun factor.  Canyon races are all skill.  No NOS, no speed breaker (which I've personally only used once, and didn't like), and the control is a little more loose.  After beating the boss you get to flip over ""cards"" and you win bonus prizes.  My first boss coughed up his RX-7 to me.  Needless to say, I was a happy camper and immediately switched over to it.

Drift events are fun, and frustrating.  Basically, you either nail it, or you don't.  My only piece of advice is floor it, and don't stop.

Speed trap - Tally the speed that you hit each trap at, and at the end the highest total wins.  However, if someone crosses the finish before you, you end up losing points.  If *you* want to win, your best bet is to bring a blocker, not a scout.  If you want your *team* to win, bring a scout.

Wingmen - Blocker, Scout, Drafter.  When you activate a blocker, they attempt to run into the person closest to them and put them into the wall, or just slow them down.  You ""activate"" them to tell them when to go, so if they can't do their job, they're probably too far when you try to use them.  Scouts have glowing trails that come off the back of their car to make it easier to tail them.  They find shortcuts for you (which is good because many are hard to find yourself) and they almost always sprint ahead of you.  (Which is where a scout should be.)  Good for helping you win a race as they'll frequently finish before you, good for winning speed traps as well (as previously mentioned).  As for drafters, when you activate them they get in front of you and attempt to allow you to stay close to them and draft them, and then when you deactivate them you shoot around the side of them.  Honestly, I have no drafter wingman yet, but eventually I plan on it.  Downside, wingmen do often get in the way.  Especially the dang scout.

I enjoy unlocking single upgrades per race.  There are some races that would otherwise be difficult if you didn't get upgrades along the way.  And speaking of upgrades; being able to tune your car for acceleration versus top end, under-steer versus over-steer, NOS duration versus volatility...  all very cool ideas.  (I don't know if other NFS games do this or not.)

Also, speaking of unlocked, I like that there are (outside of career mode) ""unlockables"".  Side challenges that you can do to get extra things in career mode.  The first thing I went for was pearlescent paint...  and holy cow was that difficult.

Anyhow, very addicting game.  Granted, I haven't played it 7 hours a day for 4 days straight and beat it... but unfortunately the game does feel a little quick.  Next thing I do after that will be to create a new alias with a different car type.  (The car type you select determines the unlocks you get... which is explained to you at the beginning of the game.)",positive

3089,"Do you like the old DOOM games?  Not counting Doom 3 obviously.  If the answer is yes then you'll enjoy this.  No hiding to recharge BS shields here.  You want more health then you'll have to beat it out of the legions of hell in very gory 'glory kills'.  The weapons all feel satisfying to use and include all the old favorites from the super shotgun to the BFG, along with some interesting upgrades for them as well that you can apply to your favorites.

The single player is fantastic fun for anyone who loved the old school DOOM games.  It's all run and gun all the time.  I found the multiplayer lacking, but the single player was so enjoyable to me that I didn't mind.  Others might not be so forgiving, but well this is my opinion and I'm giving it.

Anyway I'd recommend this game to anyone who simply wants to fight off demons and watch them explode into gibs.",positive

If however you have never played Skyrim, you REALLY need to get this game! It is one of the most amazing open world RPG titles, that will keep you occupied for a very long time! I have been playing Skyrim for years on PC, and still on occasion discover something new!

Having said that I acknowledge that this game has many flaws, But despite them I am having an absolute blast. The customization is through the roof,  The wide open world is very reminiscent of mercenaries or just cause, The chaos happening all around you at all times is awe-inspiring Most of which you can take part in or just go along your merry way. Being in an Arkfall raid is just too brilliant- 40 peeps caravaning in all these different vehicles to the Arkfall site & all hell breaking loose.

Here are my reasons:
1. Great song selection: You've got your 80's, 90's, oldies, modern, and world music. You'll be surprised that some of the most fun dances are to songs you've probably never heard of!
2. The points/medals system which unlocks new songs and mash-ups for you. This is a great feature that hasn't been in the other games. It really gets you motivated to dance even more!
3. The mash-ups themselves are really fun! they even incorporate dances/characters from just dance 2 and just dance summertime that I recognized.
4. The dances themselves are even more fun than the ones in just dance 2, although I do still love that game as well.

This game is great and the just sweat mode with non-stop shuffle is a really good cardio workout! My advice for optimum fun and exercise is to ignore the scoring and JUST DANCE!",positive

3106,"I mainly use video games for playing with guests. I recently purchased FIFA 09, and with the exception of a few other XBOX titles, this one has become the favorite.

3107,"I had my doubts about this game -- especially after seeing a picture of the included controllers.  However, I stand corrected.  This was one of the best game purchases that I've made this year.  The game is very fun, and has been a hit with my family.  Also, the tracking of the questions/puzzles and the variety of categories makes for an exciting and lasting experience.

For the price of a normal game, you get 4 wireless buzzer controllers, batteries, and a USB wireless controller IR port.  Definitely worth it after you consider how much you actually get with the game.

I'm hoping that MS decides to expand the experience in 2 ways: 1) Through downloadable content through their Live service (in the form of new questions or puzzle types) and 2) Creates new trivia games that can utilize the same controller setup.

Scene It! is a pleasant surprise for Xbox 360 gamers who want to add some casual family/friends gaming to their system (especially for those who don't own a Wii).  I hope that people buy this game just to show MS that there is a viable market for quality party games on the Xbox 360, and encourages them to release other great trivia titles.",positive
3108,"In many ways Risen is a reworking of the game Gothic 2.  It has been several years since I played that game but I remember it crashed a lot.  Risen, however, never crashed or froze up a single time.

Pros:

1.  Your character speaks.  When you select your dialog choice you actually hear the lines spoken.
2.  Nice little cut scenes with good sound effects for various actions like cooking, smithing, mixing potions, etc.  Helps with the sense of immersion.
3.  Good economics system.  You never seem to have more money than you can use.
4.  Adversaries are for the most part not leveled.  Sometimes you have to run away or avoid combat till you get stronger.  As you gain experience you actually feel like you have accomplished something.  you are able to face tougher opponents and the lower level creatures become easier to defeat)
5.  Combat is fun and challenging.  You can't pause the game to take a healing potion.  You can't just stand there clicking the attack button.  Various strategies can be utilized.

Once I levitated over a spike trap and was immediately attacked.  I was able to turn the lizard man by manuevering until the trap was behind him.  Then I kept blocking with my shield while ""pushing"".  Eventually he stepped back and was instantly killed when the trap was sprung.

Other times I would fire an arrow at a creature to get it to follow.  I could lure it away to where I could climb up on a roof and finish it off with arrows.  although sometimes they could jump up and attack me)
6.  You can climb.  There was one quest where I needed to get into a locked building.  I didn't have the Pickpocket skill to get the key from the guard but I was able to get in anyway by climbing up an adjacent building, jumping from roof to roof, and finally dropping down through a sort of skylight.  Fun.

Cons:

1.  Limited size.  Only one town.
2.  Can only play as one character and no customization is possible.
3.  No diversions as in games like Fable or Witcher.  You can't go fishing.  No gambling or skill games.  No boxing.  No ""close encounters"" except with one prostitute.  which didn't even have any funny sound effects)
4.  Quest info is not as helpful as it could be.  For instance the quest map location indicator dots should change color as you complete them.

Overall this is a fine role playing game.  I would rate it about 4.5 of 5 and will round up because of the stability.",negative

The only complaint...I check swing and the player on the screen still does a full swing.  Sometimes I just shake the WII remote ever so slightly and the guy swings and even hits the ball at times.  Surely they could fix that flaw in a revision.  It is a little difficult to see much difference in the speed of the ball coming at you as a batter.

Thi sis my first fighter stick, so I have nothing to compare to, but I will say this, it is awesome. We already know the 360 pad sucks pure a$$ for fighting games, and for someone who has been out of the SF scene for as long as I have, it REALLY sucked using the 360 controller!

Everything I can tell about this stick is pure quality, response time is perfect for me, and the button layout works. The weight of the stick is great and this thing sits on my coffee table and does what it's supposed to.

I also like the fact that I can upgrade/improve components easily, I am really thinking about doing some upgrades.

That's the urban planning part and it can be a challenge. If you don't like city building you won't like this game. There are interesting people who pop up in the cities including a mime who will do the ""invisible box"" and ""pulling an invisible rope"" as well as a man with a tamed hyena. TIP: For excellent wallpaper screenshots spend some time building Alexandria and take shots from the ocean.",positive

3135,"Wii U lets you play games on the touch screen controller, even when you aren't using a tv. Fantastic.

Download tons of great classic/retro games (NES, SuperNes, N64, etc).

Lots of great Wii U games like Xenoblade Chronicals X, Tokyo Mirage Sessions , Smash Brothers , Mario Kart, Pikman , etc.

EXPANDABLE STORAGE. Upgrade the hard drive as you want, that way you can download Wii and Wii U games if you want, cuz those take tons of storage not available out of the box.

All and all, today is the best time to get a Wii U, huge value for your money.",positive

3139,"I love the NCIS and NCIS: LA tv shows.  They did a really good job keeping the character's behaviors true to the tv series.  Ziva seems a bit off at times but the others are spot on and I think Ducky even did the voice overs...not sure on the others.  Anyway its a pretty simple game, the girlfriend loved playing it with me.  It takes about 6 hours to complete and you don't have to do anything but just play the game and you will get a platinum trophy.

I would reccomend this to both fans of NCIS like myself and fans of getting trophies on the PS3",positive

I love not having any wires going to my controller or Xbox.
Be sure to update the firmware when you first get it to ensure you get the latest and greatest version.
I have no problem hearing anyone in chat and have not had anyone say they can not hear me.
The noise cancelation works good and sound quality is excellent.
Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a quality headset!",positive

3152,"Absolutely LOVE this game! I have played most of the games that people are comparing this to. It is definitely similar to Rune Factory with its battles, and also to Disney's Magical World with the quests and collecting of materials. You begin by creating your character and choosing what life you want. There are many to choose from......alchemist, wizard, mercenary, tailor, etc. You receive training from a mentor for the life you choose, and then receive quests to help you level up. As you level up, more items are unlocked for use/purchase. If you are a cook for example, more recipes are unlocked. The people you meet will make requests, which you can choose to accept. You can go to the guild office at any time and change your life as often as you like. If you choose to be a fisherman, you will always have access to your fishing pole, even if you change your life to something else. But if you want to do any leveling up as a fisherman, you have to be living a fisherman's life when you talk to your mentor. You will constantly change lives in this game to satisfy requests and make money for life improvement and materials purchases. There are many places to explore and characters to meet. The commentary is hysterical! With the amount of reading involved, I'm not sure that younger gamers would appreciate it as much. My ten year old would never actually read all the commentary. As in Rune Factory, you can make clothes, recipes, weapons, etc. However, it is more ""hands on"" as you are timed and actually have to participate in the process.  You can buy a house and decorate it as you like. You can also change your clothes which sometimes enhances your life's abilities. Overall.....it is a wonderful game.....not one that will be over quickly.",positive

3156,"A must have for PS3 owners. Just plug it the outlet and charge your controllers without having to have your PS3 on. The two extra USB ports on the side are a great plus. I use one of them to charge my Playstation Wireless Headset, and the other for my Playstation wireless keypad.",negative
3157,"I own the xbox 360 and the xbox one versions of this game.  The Xbox one version is updated more frequently and gets dlc first.  The main difference is in the graphics.  The Xbox 360 doesn't have the same clarity, high res textures, or lighting as the xbox one version. But, otherwise, they are practically identical.
I play mainly shooters, like Call of Duty, Halo, Gears of War, and now Titanfall.  The game play is very fast even compared to CoD.  Call of Duty taught you how to shoot at opponents.  Titanfall teaches you how to traverse to your advantage.  Getting around the maps quickly is key.  The movement is very fluid and wallrunning, jumping, and even ziplining get you nearly anywhere on the maps that you can see.  See that tower? Go ahead, climb it.  TItans are also quick and fun to play.  You can set up your pilot classes and your titan classes however you wish.  It feels like the game could have used more weapons and titans, but what is there fills each niche for most players.  You like quick and quiet?  what about loud and proud?  Sniping?  A walking Tank? or a more nimble strider titan?  you decide.
This is the shooter I have been waiting for since CoD 4 MW.  it brings good things from all over and puts them into a focused multiplayer experience.  Try it.",positive
3158,I'm so happy I brought this. I always loved this game series,positive
3159,"I basically charge my controllers through plug and play cords.  One of my batteries went bad so I figured it was time to get replacements and I've been very satisfied.  So far these are showing no difference in play times that the original batteries I bought with the controllers did.  Unfortunately I can't give you specific times as I tend to play with the plug and play cords connected regardless of a full charge or not, but when I have unplugged them on occasion my controller lasted a few days before I had to plug it back in (and that is when I was still addicted to Skyrim).

So, my advice is these are good and if you need new batteries or a good set up back ups you'll do well by buying them.",positive
3160,"I had high expectations for this game, because it was developed by the same guys who did FFX.  Lost Odyssey definitely met my expectations.  It's really awesome how the story unfolds, and most of the characters are extremely well done.  The dream sequences are impeccable.  Overall, this game offered me and my roommate a fantastic 90+ hours of gameplay each.  I would definitely recommend it to others.",positive
3161,"I LOVED this game. I even played it through several times and got every item and every ending. It's not a very long game, but that wasn't an issue for me. Plus having Gackt sing ""Redemption"" at the end was very important to me because I was going through a really hard time and needed to hear that song.

I would love it they'd make more games around this (especially something more with Sephiroth).",positive
3162,"I had heard of the God of War series for several years now but never played them since I didn't own a Playstation 2.  Once I picked up a PS3 and saw the low price this game was going for, I decided to give these classic PS2 games a try.  This pair of games has to be one of the best deals in all of gaming right now, and if like me you haven't played God of War before you should seriously think about getting this game.  These games are pretty gory and violent, so if you're a parent you might not want your younger children playing this game, but it's isn't any more violent than a lot of other popular M rated games currently available.

Everything about these games is fantastic.  The controls are reasonably simple yet deep enough to add real strategy to this game (mindless button mashing mostly works on lower difficulty levels, and absolutely does not work on higher difficulty levels), and most importantly, are precise.  The animation and art in this game are top-notch.  While God of War isn't really faithful to its source material, this doesn't really matter, and if the game gets teenagers more interested in reading classical mythology, that's a fantastic side effect of a game which is already lots of fun to play.  There is a lot of bonus content which only becomes unlocked after beating the game, some of which requires you to beat the game at the highest difficulty level, so for very serious players there's plenty of challenge to be had here.

The graphics have been upgraded from the original PS2 games, although of course these games don't look as good as games which were designed for PS3.  Nevertheless, the games are much better than what you would have seen on the PS2, and certainly do not detract from the gameplay experience.  It's a bit odd that some of the cut scenes weren't remastered, but this is just a minor issue since these cut scenes are only a minor part of the game.

Two awesome games at a really low price make this a great purchase.  As if you weren't already getting enough when you buy this game, you also get a code which lets you download the 2009 E3 God of War III playable demo, and of course if you buy this game at Amazon right now you get a 5 dollar credit towards GOW3.  Remaking great PS2 games and releasing them on the PS3 for a budget price is a fantastic idea, and hopefully other publishers and developers will follow in SCEA's footsteps and release their own compilations of classic PS2 games on the PS3.",positive
3163,"I don't know why everyone calls this game MLB 2k5 or simply MLB, the title is actually Major League Baseball 2K5. Some could get it confused w/ the MLB 2000 series games by 989/sony.
I don't really know why all of a sudden sega sports is no longer involved in the series and whatever happened to highheat and allstar baseball? None the less, this is the top MLB game this year. Personally, I hate EA games cuz they wanna monopolize the whole world. This game is 20 (got mine on sale for 14.50), MVP is 30, and MLB 06 is 40 but you can send away for a free cap, whoopie! Due to the fact that the 2K sports series have been so successful this has forced EA to finally drop their price in order to remain competitive(for their baseball title at least) from 50 to 30, so we should all say thank you to sega sports & espn for breaking the price barrier.
  Anyways, back to the game. I love it, graphics are tight and the ESPN feel, the commentary by Joe Morgan & the fat white toad are dead on. It feels just like you're watching/playing a sunday night game on ESPN. You can even add customs soundtracks w/ the xbox version! The best on-line baseball title hands down. I highly recommend this game over any other MLB title. Plus you'll be happy you saved some green in the process. (Jeter's even on the cover! Go Yankees!! MVP has the a-hole ""man-ram"". Red Sox Fans suck fat donkeys... for Life!) Major League Baseball 2K5 rocks!
MVP fans will by crying 99 tears because EA lost the baseball license for the next fews years, but it's so sweet to see the gaming giant get some of their own medicine. ""Believe It !!""",positive

3167,"I love this game. I'm not a huge gamer, all of a sudden we decided to get a wii, and I don't like games where I can die, be hunted or need to hide. So driving works nicely for me! I will say it brings out my....angry side. I yell and curse a lot and probably scare the crap out of my neighbors. But its a really fun game to play with my boyfriend or my parents!! Next thing I know my dad just HAD to have mario kart after playing it at our house. He didn't even have a wii system to begin with, so he had to get that as well, but apparently to play mario kart, its worth it. Also, my dad hasn't played a video game since the early 80's, he had no clue. But he picked it up pretty fast and soon had figured out how to play with me online no problem.  We've had a lot of fun playing in the worldwide section with each other, even though we're in different states which is an awesome feature. and I don't even have to let him beat me anymore, he does it with me playing normal. So, honestly, this is a great game for all ages, from the most super casual haven't picked up a video game in decades person, to the one who plays avidly. Yay for mario kart!!",positive
3168,"Myst/Riven/Crystal Key..etc. feeling. This is one of the best Adventure games I have played. The scenery is beautiful from world to world..even space. The purpose of your character(s) is believable. The concept is brilliant. There are different worlds you enter. As you go to each of them you become someone different. The importance of that is to help you succeed in each world. Many different characters and puzzles to face. The whole game is fantastic. Some of the puzzles I have never played in any other adventure game, which made it more fun. There is a few that you will be pressured for time, so save! Worth the time, money and brainpower. I LOVED this game!!!!",positive

3171,"This is an excellent game. The storyline is deep and nuanced, graphics are excellent and storytelling is dramatic and well written. Additionally, this edition gives you all the accompanying DLC to further expand the experience. Highly reommend this to any gamer who enjoys sword and sorcery type action/adventure. For achievement hunters, achievements are solidly challenging and varied. To get the full gamerscore would require either multiple playthroughs or keeping save files at particluar junctions of the game where you are required to make choices that lead to branching storylines / reults.",positive
3172,"Since MOH I was never really into the WWII shooter games, but I must agree that Call of Duty World at War is top notch. As a veteran in gaming, I now have my own kids and I must say that my biggest concern in purchasing the game was the increased violence and use of language. There were mixed statements as to whether the added gore and bad language could be turned off, and I'm happy to say that it can be filtered in the options menu. Yes, I know a lot of younger people won't understand why I would want to turn off the blood and language, but when you are older and have a 5 year old in the other room who repeats all that they hear, you'll understand; that is unless you consider yourself trash and don't understand the meaning of certain words, the use of decency and appropriate language. The graphics are phenomenal and have a come a long way. The game play is challenging but fun and gives you a sense of realism. If the M rating had been tilting your decision into not purchase the game, be confident that the game plays closer to a T rated game with the filter turned on. Overall it is a great purchase and one of the best shooters available.",positive

3174,"I was a little hesitant buying these because of a few of the bad reviews, but to my surprise, they work fine.

*If you're thinking of buying cables, go ahead and save yourself 10 bux and get these, they work fine.

*If you're wondering what the difference in picture quality is, I'd say it's slightly noticeable.  It does make a little bit of a difference on a game like Zelda, but on the more cartoony games it doesn't.  (Gamespot did a comparison of component vs composite)

Is it worth it? - If you have $20 to blow, and you're going to keep your console for a few years, I guess it's worth it, but if $20 means a lot to you, I'd say the cables don't make that much of a difference.",negative
3175,"For a game with so many five star reviews one might think it is overrated, but if you haven't played it , get that thought out of your head immediatly! I'll tell you why this game is one of the greatest games games ever made...

Graphics-10/10 graphically, this game is amazing. I've seen games for playstation that have worse graphics than this. The characters and backrounds are extremely detailed in lush color. Some SNES games have a tendency to have rather boring colored backrounds, but not this game. Also, the techniques used during battle look great. There isn't much else to say other than amazing.

Music-10/10 WOW...the music is nothing short of miraculous. This game has got to have some of the best music I have ever heard in any video game, especially in the Zeal section. The music is close to the calibur of Super Metroid, which in my opinion has the greatest music for a video game. It is at the same calibur as Final Fantasy 6, tactics, 8,7 and besides those it may be the greatest soundtrack for a RPG ever made. I might think this game has THE greatest soundtrack ever made, but to be honest I didn't actually play this game till 2 and a half or so years ago, so I didn't have any memories of the game tied in with the music, and games I played when I was a kid seem to touch me in a stronger way. No complaints what so ever here.

Storyline- 10/10 The idea that things done in a different time period effects the future is not only brilliant, but it is revolutionary. You will really start to feel for the characters here, and the stroyline will grip you into the game.

Entertainment/gameplay- 20/10 Yep, 20/10, there are so many side quests to accomplish here, and every one of them is fantastic. You never know what you might unlock if you do something in a different time period. This game is pretty short, only maybe 20 hours the first time through, but if you go through and level up your characters to the max and complete all the sidequests, your looking at easily 40 hours.

Overall- 100/10. Yep, you read it right. 10/10 isn't enough for this gem, so I upgraded it to 100/10. Like I said earlier, I didn't first play this game until 2 and a half years ago, and I still loved it, prooving how great this game is. If you are into old- school RPGs then you will probably already have this game, but anyone else will love it too. I think it is innovative and up-to-date enough to satisfy even PS2 fans.

....Just get it if you can find it...!",positive
3176,"Excellent gameplay wether you choose to play stealthy or just kill everything in sight.  Just one word of caution...if you shoot or try to kill Delilah in any way before you use the heart on her in the final mission, a huge bug will manifest itself and she disappears never to be seen again, thus breaking the game.  You would have to start at a previous save, or, in my case, start the whole game over.",neutral
3177,"This is a grand old dungeon crawl,albeit set in ancient Greece and Egypt. I'm tired of waiting and waiting for D3,and if it has the same pathetic save method as D2,I'm not gonna buy it.

This game is hardly original,but since it is like 10 years+ since D1 came out,the improvement in graphics is astounding. And the SFX and music are very,very cool. I would love it if THQ put out the soundtrack by itself. It's that good.

I have been playing it now for a couple of weeks,and am extremely addicted to it as I was D1. I am looking forward to the ExP due out in March. All in all,I think THQ did a great thing for us Diablo addicts. And I'm pretty sure the XP will be lovely too. Thank you,THQ,for this gorgeous game.",positive

I was shocked when I first bought it, but I decided to stick with it and it was a very rewarding experience.  It reintroduced me to tactics I had forgotten in video games: hit and run, luring enemies, stealth, and more.  It is very fast paced, very aggressive compared to the previous games in the series, but requires just as much if not more in the skill department.  After playing this, I went back and replayed all of the previous games( Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls, Demon Souls) and really found out I missed out on a great series.  Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this game.  While this game is excellent, I feel that Demon Souls on the PS3 is the best out of all of them.",neutral

But those are in the $50 - $70 range. At the $30- $40 range, I think this Logitech G300 gaming mouse is perfect for entry-level gamers, persons looking for more control and customization, and casual gamers.

FEATURES

* 2500 DPI - more than enough for casual gamers and person looking to get into gaming. If you're looking for fast twitch, very reflexive movement, you may want to consider the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G9X-Programmable-Laser-Gaming-Mouse-with-Precision-Grips/dp/B001NTFATI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G9X Programmable Laser Gaming Mouse with Precision Grips</a>
* 9 Customizable controls - two buttons on the left and right edge of the mouse, scroll button, two buttons below the scroll, and of course the left and right mouse click.
* Up to 3 stored modes - this is invaluable, especially for organization. Say you want a normal computing mode, gaming mode, etc.
* Logitech software detects games and let's you customize accordingly. You can customize the controls according to a specific game. You're not just customizing keystrokes, but also combinations and commands. Customization has a lot of depth.
* Symmetrical design - let's both left and right handers use this mouse.

DESIGN - I love the G300's design! It feels comfortable, the buttons (left, right, and buttons) feel easy, and provides good support for your wrist and fingers. There's some cushion on the side of the mouse, which is another plus. The side of the mouse also has customizable colors in which indicates a specific mode. Very cool.

INSTALLATION

Easy, flawless, and simple. Without the logitech software, you're still able to use it and change the DPI on the fly. With the logitech software, you can customize the controls and store up to 3 profiles in the mouse. I like that you can make the light whatever color you want it to be. The software can be easily found on Logitech's website.

GAMING EXPERIENCE

Thus far, I've felt more confident with this mouse. It's no savior, but definitely improves the feel of gaming. Aiming and moving feels smooth, left to right, up down, etc. Fluid and consistent is how I would describe it. Games I've played so far have been smoother like with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Counter-Strike-Source/dp/B000AOJ7FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Counter-Strike: Source</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Left-4-Dead-2/dp/B002BRYXRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Left 4 Dead 2</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mass-Effect-2/dp/B001VJ4DHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mass Effect 2</a>. At 2500 max DPI, you should be able to move across and around the screen fairly quickly.

COMPUTING EXPERIENCE

Doing tasks like Microsoft office, video editing, surfing the net, buying Amazon products (bad joke), and other computer tasks feel smoother. The customizable buttons gives me more options, like making one of the buttons a common keystroke combo like ""undo."" Instead of holding down ctrl + z, I can click one button on the mouse.

MINOR NUANCES
- The wire is a little bit long. It's not such a big deal, as I just tie the wire.
- It is a little small for a gaming mouse, but it's not really that bad. I've posted a picture  for comparisons (which you can view in this mouse's image gallery). It's not such a big concern, but potentially can be for persons with bigger hands. Consider going to your local electronics store to try out this mouse.

BOTTOM LINE:  If you're looking for a solid inexpensive mouse to get into gaming, I recommend this mouse. It's great for better control for computer tasks, surfing, small games, and casual gaming.",negative

3207,"Awesome game! The graphics in gameplay are obviously a huge step down from what I was used to on the Wii U version, but I never expect anything incredible on the 3DS in terms of graphics. The cutscenes still look pretty. However, I don't use 3D often, so I have no opinion on how that looks in this game.

If you've played the Wii U version, Legends is very similar. They have made good use of the 3DS's dual screen by showing the map on the touchscreen while you're battling. The story line is mostly the same, with the new characters' battles and storylines added in. Since the game doesn't have multiplayer capabilities, they've made some adjustments so you can switch between characters by touching their face on the touchscreen. You can also send characters around the map by touching the map. That's proven to be very helpful so I can fight with one character while the other characters run across the giant fields to get in position for the next mission. Having two or more playable characters next to each other while fighting a big boss makes the big boss weaker and the players stronger. They have added new missions to each battle to mix things up a bit and added owl statues in some stages so you can play the ocarina and teleport to different areas of the map. If you played the first game, I'm sure you'll realize what a benefit that can be.

Linkle is my favorite of the added characters. She's fast and her attacks can take out a bunch of enemies at once. Toon Link and Tetra are fun as well. I love that Toon Link's special attack is the hurricane spin from Windwaker. He even gets dizzy for a second afterward.

This game also included an insert with a code to unlock the new characters from Legends on the Wii U version of the game, which made me happy. I wish they would have made a way to transfer the levels on my Wii U characters to my 3DS characters, since I spent so many hours leveling them up on the Wii U.",positive
3208,Fun Game! I'm very much enjoying it! Highly recommended and great price!,positive

3210,"I have played all the AW games, usually 300 hours per game. I do miss the War Room. I do miss the Hard Campaign. I do miss the old CO Powers. But this is still a five-star game for me.

3211,Talk about a fun and addicting game. I have tried the other versions of need for speed and by far this is my favorite. Online racing usually there are alot of other people out there playing and that is a blast.,negative

3213,"Seriously, it's easy. If you loved Borderlands and it's sequels on the last gen platforms, then you are going to love this. It's been somewhat souped up graphically (but not really in a 'Wow' way), but does look noticeably better. The games run like a dream, and the amount of content you get is amazing (two full games and all the bits and pieces of DLC). I'm playing Borderlands 2 for the second time and the humor stands up incredibly well.
I might be biased, as these are my favorite games ever, but this package is unbeatable for the price. Love, love, love it!!!",positive
3214,"was skeptical at first because i had a purchased a more expensive keyboard that ended up being defective, I love the click of the keys and quality of this keyboard for the price. you don't need to download the software in order to use it, you can just plug and play if you want.",positive
3215,"My son & I are big Nintendo fans - me from back in the day with the NES, him from the 3DS.  So when we decided to get a Wii, the Wii U was a no-brainer.  We love it!  Not only do we use it for games, but we've hooked up Amazon Prime and Netflix through it.  Now we are looking forward to Mario Kart 8!!",positive
3216,"Assassin's Creed Unity had a bit of a launch failure. The game was riddled with bugs, some making the game unplayable. Because this seems to be happening more often, I generally don't buy games like this on launch day. (Bethesda taught me that lesson) Now that several gigs worth of updates and patches have been released, I thought it would be a safe bet. I was right. So, do yourself a favor, ignore the 1 star reviews citing the bugs and glitches, they are now irrelevant.

I've been playing AC since the original and have played all releases both console and portable up to this point. I was getting a little worried with the last couple games as they just didn't grab me the way that the Ezio Trilogy (AC II, Brotherhood and Revelations). I contemplated giving up on the series, but I'm glad I didn't. AC: Unity has recaptured the play and feel of the Ezio adventures.

The game starts out as most AC titles do. You are an average young person, enjoying your average life. You are quickly impacted by a great tragedy. This tragedy, you will find out, is part of a much larger plot and you are - in reality - descended from a long line of Assassins. You take up sword and hidden blade and focus on training so that you may exact your revenge.

Arno reminds me of a slightly less cocky Ezio. The writing and voice acting is all well done. The story is interesting and well paced.

The world is HUGE. I think this is the largest yet. Paris is rendered beautifully, historical cathedrals and government buildings have been recreated with painstaking detail. It's stunning.

The world is very densely populated. I can see why there were framerate issues initially. There are streets that are shoulder to shoulder people, crowds are everywhere, fire is everywhere. It's pretty insane that the hardware can render everything. I've had no issues with chugging or framerate dropping however, these issues have been resolved.

There are two factions who will get in your way; the guards and the revolutionaries. Neither faction will attack you on site like in some of the earlier titles. However, if you make it a habit of frequently killing one or the other or both, they'll start recognizing you outright and attacking you on the spot due to your reputation. There's no tearing down fliers or paying off town criers this time around either. When you're marked, you're marked.

The combat is also much more challenging and realistic. I remember taking on dozens of guards in the earlier game and dispatching them with ease. This was because they'd essentially line up and take turns attacking. You'd parry, counter, parry, counter, etc until all were dead. Not in Unity. Guards/Revolutionaries will swarm on you and attack simultaneously often while one of them stands back and shoots at you with a flintlock. You will need to hone your parrying and dodging skills as well as utilize your smoke bombs and other various tricks to survive. Even then, you may make one wrong move and find yourself impaled on a rapier. It's a refreshing improvement even though it's maddening at times.

Unity really pushes customization. Unlike the previous titles where you had essentially 3-4 sets of gear and then a ""master set"" of some kind, Unity has several options in each of five tiers and then a legendary tier. Each option has slightly different stats and looks markedly different. There is also a myriad of color palettes to change your outfit. Weapons follow the same system. This is done so that when you play co-op with your friends you don't look like the clone gang running around. It's a cool feature and definitely keeps things unique. Gear can be purchased, but some can only be unlocked by completing certain missions or achievements.

Also, your equipment and weapons actually make a difference. In some of the earlier titles I'd find myself upgrading my weapons and equipment just to look cooler and to fill up my weapon room. However, because counter attacking was almost always an instant kill - no matter the caliber of your weapon - there wasn't really a need. In Unity your gear will make a big difference. The damage you do when countering and outright attacking is largely impacted by what you're wearing/wielding and your enemies are different levels (1-5) as well. You may be in the wrong area with subpar equipment and find yourself in a bad situation very quickly. It's nice that equipment has graduated from being mostly cosmetic.

Gameplay is largely the same as it has been in the past. You have the primary story missions, side missions, chests/artifact/trinkets littered around to collect, shops to buy and renovate, etc. You are able to do these at your leisure. There are also random muggings and criminal activities for you to thwart. This is done by either tackling, killing or threatening the assailants. Each time you complete one, you get a point towards a total goal of points, once you reach your goal you get a reward (money, special equipment, etc) then it resets with a higher goal. You can no longer harm or kill innocents. I appreciate this as it always irritated me when a civilian got in the way of a fight and I accidently killed them.

Co-op is handled by missions. There will be an NPC at various positions around the city and they will offer you a co-op quest when you approach them. This can be done with your friends, or random matchmaking. It makes it easy to knock out a co-op mission and get back to your single player. There are also Clubs you can create or join. This is essentially a guild where you share a common space and can compete via rankings with other guilds. It's a nice addition and makes it easier to play with people you want to play with.

Micro transactions are prevalent in Unity. This is a bit off-putting to me. Additional missions were available for purchase on launch. I don't mind DLC when it is a significant amount of content created after the release and it isn't a situation where I'm being forced to pay for the ""good"" ending. Paying for additional missions off the bat seems in poor taste, however, as it probably could've just been included in the game instead of being ransomed after the fact. Also, you can pay real money for gear. It's gear that you can just buy with in-game currency as well, but the ""pay to cheat"" option just feels fickle to me. Lastly, there is a man who stands in your base who will allow you to join a friend's game or invite them to yours. I was notified that I had a friend who was currently online. I didn't realize this friend had bought Unity so I clicked ""Invite to Join Your Game"". I got a text message from the friend saying that he was taken to the purchase page for Unity. He was online but wasn't playing Unity and didn't own it. It seems like a stupid ploy to get your friends to buy the game. While this is all annoying, it's not game breaking and you can easily spend zero extra dollars and play the complete game without feeling like you're missing out.

Ubisoft has been offering a service called UPlay for a while now. It's free to join and you can link your profile to your UPlay account. When you accomplish certain things in the game, you get UPlay Points which can be accumulated and spent in any Ubisoft game for additional outfits, gear upgrades, etc. I always thought it was a cool way to reward loyal customers. Now, on top of Uplay, they have Initiates. This tracks your progress in the game and awards you levels. When you attain certain levels you can unlock various golden chests scattered around that have money, additional outfits, etc in them. It will also tell you what kind of assassin you are based on your actions and how you play. ALSO, there's the Unity Companion App on the App store. This is a mini-game which is essentially the abroad missions from Brotherhood and Revelations where you recruit assassins and send them on missions for a period of time and they level up and then you send them on harder missions. Completing missions in the companion app unlock blue chests that contain gear, money, etc. You earn currency that heal assassins and buy new assassins, or you can just outright buy the currency (more microtransactions) and if you pay for the premium version you unlock better assassins etc. Otherwise the app is completely free and enjoyable. Uplay, Initiates and Companion App add a lot of additional content to the game, but can be a bit overwhelming and confusing at first when you're trying to figure out all the mechanics of the actual game. The menus are less user friendly than previous titles in the series.

Overall, the bottom line is that the bugs have been fixed and it's time to pick a copy up. I've experience zero bugs since playing. This is the most robust AC to date and for everyone out there who, like myself, misses Ezio, your prayers have been answered. The customization and side content in Unity is astounding and the fighting and battle mechanics are the best they've ever been. If you're an AC fan or looking to get into the series, Unity is definitely worth picking up.",positive

3218,"I was hesitant to buy Vita when it came out but now so many awesome games out on Vita and price drop, I decided to purchase it and give it a shot. I have to say I am not disappointed.

******************************Pros**************************************

- High Definition Screen and Graphics: This is the greatest strength of PS Vita. I love the high resolution graphics on Vita. Sometimes they are indistinguishable from PS3 games. Cant describe in words how nice games such as Killzone and Wipeout look on PS Vita. It is unbelievable that a handheld can have such graphics.

- Controls : Gotta love dual analog stick. Sony took a while but finally brought it on the handheld. Bravo.

-Touchscreen: I really like the interactive touch screen menus. It makes navigation a lot more intuitive then going up and down the list using analog or side buttons. Also in many games they make the gameplay more interactive.

- Quality of games: This is one of the main reasons I had to buy it now. With Killzone, Persona4Golden, Uncharted, Sly, Soul Sacrifice, Resistance, Walking Dead and PS3 ports (FFX/X2 HD, Injustice, Ratchet) there are enough games to last me for years.

-PS4 Remote play feature: While I don't have a PS4 (yet), I tried it on my friends PS4 and it works great. Definitely a very useful feature.

-PSP Titles playability: I haven't tried this either but I read that you can download PSP titles on PS Vita. I am happy I purchased some PSP games digitally. Hopefully I will be able to play them on Vita

-Recent Price drop: Definitely helps.

-The Holiday bundle: 4 free games and 3 of them being hit titles. Why not?

******************************Cons**************************************

-Memory Cards: In the era when you can download full games, Sony should provide big memory cards at cheaper price or at least give option to buy memory cards from other companies.

******************************Conclusion**************************************

I didn't buy Vita so far because I felt that it may not survive competition against 3DS and to be honest it is still doing bad compared to 3DS. But with so many awesome Vita games in the market, price drop and PS4 remote play, I have no regrets purchasing Vita this holiday season.",positive

3233,"Return To Castle Wolfenstein is the sequel to a fantastic game Wolfenstein 3D, which came out way back in the day. I had high hopes for this game, because Activision has a good reputation in the gaming industry, and WWII games make excellent first-person shooters.
Once again, you are B.J Blastowicz (Don't hold me to that spelling) and you are trying to take down the Nazi War Machine. You and your co-agent are captured and held in Castle Wolfenstein, and through clues early in the game you find out that the Nazis are planning a huge archeaological dig, but for the sake of the plot, I won't mention what they are digging for. (You find out soon enough.)
The graphics are very good (considering that the game came out a long time ago), but the physics need some work. Clipping is a problem as bodies fall to the ground stiff as a board, and often go through the walls. This doesn't take away from the fantastic gameplay and sound though.
The gameplay of RTCW is perhaps the best of any FPS shooter I've ever played. The enemy AI is fantastic, especially of Helga's elite guard. A group of hot Nazi chicks armed with their silence stens. Enemies will peak around corners, and perform jumping rolls to evade, and they shoot with pinpoint accuracy, even on the easiest difficulty. The game is very challenging and made me sweat more than once. The fabulous soundtrack is a great addition. When alarms go off, the RTCW theme song kicks in, giving the game a desperate feel to it. During stealth missions (which are fantsatic), mysterious, low-key compositions give the environment a great feel to it.
Overall, RTCW is a wonderful FPS of epic proportions and should be played by all WWII buffs as well as fans of the FPS genre.",positive
3234,"It's not easy to buy something for a child now a days. Everything is so expensive. My daughter has been wanting ""something"" for a long time now. So I bought her a wii.

3237,"This game was a big side step for the series. After three games that essentially built on top of one another the 4th game needed to be something different. They mostly succeed in taking the series in a new direction.

There some significant changes from the previous 3 games but they are similar enough that if you enjoyed the other games you will probably enjoy this one.

This game kind of took a small step towards the fire emblem games as far as story and adding a little more value to your units.

Things i enjoyed:

-love the new way they handle CO powers. I felt like the powers were getting out of hand and were hindering the strategy more than helping it. The Co powers have been toned down and you now just place your CO in a vehicle and they have a power that affects a certain area.

-i love all the new units, from the tank buster to the bike infantry. mechanics wise this game is the best in the series.

things i didn't enjoy:

-I didn't enjoy the change to a more serious story. I always enjoyed the light  nature of the previous games and i don't think this worked all that well.

- the color scheme is really bland. I know it fits with the story but i get so tired looking a purplish gray landscape and all of the colors have a dull gray to them.

Overall this game is the best mechanics wise but there is less replaybility than part 3 because you don't have any of the side games that dual strike had.

you do have online multiplayer but the online services will be cancelled next year by Nintendo.",positive

3249,this is actually the first time I own Xbox One Kinect for myself because I always wanted to play all the new Xbox One Kinect games and it really does sucks that Microsoft doesn't care about kinect anymore it really has so much potential and it really does work flawlessly with Cortana just make sure your room is silent because if you have too much noise in the background it will not function properly so far I have no problems with it I have been using it since I got it for Christmas 2017 so far so good  but for those who are reading my review just a fair warning they have officially killed Xbox One Kinect adapter it's not even in their official website anymore the only way you can get it is through 3rd party websites or retail stores so if you are planning on getting Xbox One S or X Amazon is your safest bet that is all you need to know ,positive

Yes some features of the game might be the same as Resident Evils features and yes it has zombies but these zombies are way different than the ones in RE. But this game has magick and really cool wepons. They range from a scramasax sword to a .38 revolver. The save feature is very easy to use. The graphics are drop dead gorgeous. Everything from the detail on a stained glass window the letters on a table. This game looks really amazing. Don't even get me started on the magick system. I'll tell you a little bit about it. Ok you can create your own spells and you discover spells along the way. You need three things to make a spell; a circle of power which let's you know the power of the spell, runes which are the codes you need for  the spell and magick codexes which tell you what the runes are for. If you don't have the codex for a certain rune it remains a mystery. The gameplay is awesome. The puzzles are pretty hard. But you can figure most of them out without the strategy guide. The combat system is very well put together, plus the targeting system is really cool. You can cut off certain limbs of the enemies. The camera system is also very well put together. The camera doesn't get stuck behind walls or anything. It is lke a cinematic camera. It pans to where you walk or stand. I give this game a 10 out of 5. I definetly recommend this game.",positive

I honestly don't care.  I don't remember the last time I had this much fun playing a game.  This is one of the few games where I felt like and honest to goodness hero.  Killing slavers, bartering a truce between vampires and settlers of the Capital Wasteland, the list goes on and on.  It feels like the first time I played Half Life.

3268,"As far as Im concerned this is way way better than the first Even though this is not a survival-horror (I don't see how it could be). This game would fit in the action/adventure. You get lotz of sweet weapons like the 9MM,Heavy Machine Gun,Shotgun,and the cool Rocket Launcher and(my personal favorite) the almighty Anti Tank Rifle. Ragina also gets a preety awesome missle pod. There are way more dinosaures than you can shake a leg at. On every screen there has to be atleast 2 dinos if not 3 or 4. There are about 20 dinos on here for every single dino on dino crisis 1. There are also lots of different dinos like the swimming thingers that live in the water,the Flying thingers, Ovi Raptors,Allasaures and of course the main dinos the Raptors. Even our old buddy the T-Rex is back and there is an even LARGER dino that the T-Rex fears. Every time you kill a dino you get points called extinct points that you can use to buy tools, gunns, ammo and recovery items. The replay value is great because after you beat the game you get the extra crisis mode where you get to buy dinos and battle them with a friend and every time you beat the game you get a new dino. There is also anouther mode you unlock called the dino colliseum. I recommend this game to everyone,though some of the horror-survival lovers will be a bit dissapointed...Buy it!!!!",positive

The story is actually surprisingly involved. Instead of taking place on Mars, the setting for the first game, it puts you back on a futuristic Earth that looks like a mix between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UBMSB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>&nbsp;and the future scenes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>. Earth, it seems, is warring over nanotechnology and currently it is controlled by one man, Chancellor Sopot. Sopot is like a modern day Hitler (but looks like Stalin) and rules with an iron fist. Originally, this nanotechnology was used to create super soldiers but everything got out of hand and Sopot ordered the super soldiers to be destroyed. Well, the super soliders don't like that very much and form a rebel resistance. You play Alias, a member of a rebel squad of the nano-enhanced super soldiers and you try to bring down the government, referred to as The Commonwealth. The story is more political than you'd expect, but it does so without being boring or preachy.

Graphics-wise, the game is stunning. The levels, weapons, characters and environmental effects are all presented beautifully. Even looking back now, the game's graphics still impress for a sixth generation console. The cut scenes are also well-done with a cinematic quality, particularly the opening which introduces the characters and story. It acts as an introduction and a trailer of sorts, really getting you in the mood to play the game.

The music and sound effects are excellent. I have my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PS2/dp/B0000C7GHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PS2</a>&nbsp;hooked up to a home theater system and it sounds amazing! The explosions literally shake the room while gunfire can be heard in all speakers and both the music and dialogue are crisp and clear. I also found it cool that each weapon has it own unique sound effect - for example, the assault rifle and machine pistol both sound slightly different, instead of recycling the same bullet noise. A minor detail, but it really completes the experience for me. The voice acting is magnificent. Somehow they managed to get both Lance Henriksen and Jason Statham to provide their voices to some of the characters and they handle it surprisingly well. It adds to the game's cinematic feel. The other voice actors, especially the rest of your squad, all do a great job and I must say that I actually felt like I was part of the team. Many games have trouble nailing the ""team camaraderie"" thing.

The gameplay is fast and fun. The game is much more of a first person shooter than the original game and I think this works in its favor, delivering a more enjoyable experience. The controls are responsive and easy to pick up, utilizing the shoulder buttons perfectly for primary and secondary fire, as well as throwing grenades. The weapons and enemies are pretty standard, but they're done so well that it feels refreshing. There's a large variety of weapons as well, satisfying everyone from snipers to explosive lovers (I fall into the latter). There's even the return of the railgun from the first game, but it's gotten a major overhaul and is a lot more fun this time around. Vehicle combat is also a large part of the game, whether you're on a tank on in a gunship, these stages are very fun and are a welcome change from the running and gunning. My favorite vehicle stage is when you take control of a heavily-armored robot; it reminded me of one of my favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SNES/dp/B000035Y6D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SNES</a>&nbsp;games,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cybernator/dp/B000035XZP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cybernator</a>. Since your character is nano-enhanced (except for the first level where you steal the nanotechnology), your health regenerates. This concept was relatively new at the time and suits the gameplay very well.

The multiplayer in Red Faction II is one of the BEST multiplayer games on the PS2. I am honestly still surprised at the amount of depth and customization it offers. Many seventh generation video games can't get the multiplayer right, yet here's a sixth generation one that has a great single player game and an awesome multiplayer experience that still holds up well to this day! The best part is the inclusion of ""bots"", computer-controlled enemies, so if your friends are busy, you can still have a good time with up to five AI enemies. You can even create your own bots and give them certain skills, such as high accuracy for sniping or high aggressiveness for direct combat. There are four different modes, including your standard deathmatch and capture the flag, each with a team based option so you can choose to play with bots on your side if you want. The matches are highly customizable also, giving you options to turn off certain weapons (like the one shot-one kill railgun), change the default weapon you spawn with, even turn on infinite ammo and no reloads. The multiplayer levels are cleverly designed too, giving you many different maps to choose from.

I really can't think of anything wrong with this game. The story is great, the game itself is highly-polished with excellent graphics and sound, and the multiplayer is phenomenal. The game was released on the Xbox and Gamecube as well, but I own the PS2 version so I don't know if they're any good. Regardless, I highly recommend Red Faction II to anyone who likes shooters or even anyone who owns a PlayStation 2.",positive

3299,"So how in the WORLD did Nintendo get away with a game like this?  Were they determined to come up with something extreme possibly because they feared people would think they're venturing too far into children's game territory?  Unfortunately they would inevitably end up mostly making children's games and try to cover it up by describing themsevles as a family-oriented company when the Wii was released, but for this one point in time Nintendo and Rare didn't hold anything back.  Also yeah, Rare!  It turns out the same company responsible for the Donkey Kong Country series had a naughty/edgy side too, haha. Wow I should have taken those old reviews for Conker's Bad Fur Day more seriously 10-12 years ago.  I saw a cute fuzzy little squirrel in the pictures and automatically assumed this was a game for kids and that the vulgar nature was an exaggeration.  No, it's all true!

This game is *awesome*.  But it's NOT for kids!  I'm totally not kidding what I'm about to say- this game says the ""sh"" word and disguises the king of ALL swear words in ways that almost reveal it!  To top it off, there's blood that often pours and gushes with disturbing noticeable puddles whenever you kill enemies with guns or frying pans and there's even decapitations (eat your heart out Mortal Kombat!)  But this game goes a step further.  I guess the makers *really* wanted to come out with something ridiculously intense, likely a message sent to Sony that Nintendo can hang with the big boys too.  Brace yourself- you can also urinate on enemies while controlling your drunken squirrel main character (Conker) who wobbles back and forth struggling to stand up confidently proving he's not intended for children, and you even fight a gigantic mound of operatic/poetic singing poop by throwing toilet paper in its mouth!  They really play up the poop theme throughout a good chunk of the first half with balls and rivers of the gooey brown stuff everywhere (diarrhea in particular).  Ewww!  Also throwing up, farting sound effects, etc.  LOTS of it!

But there's a reason I'm giving this game 5 stars and it's not just the shock value either.  It's the fact that this orange little squirrel character has a LOT of personality. He's the type of character many of us grown men can relate to.  He likes naked women and we often see displays of breasts presented in outrageous ways that stand out lusciously (like that sunflower woman for example!) and Conker just LOVES money.  Collecting money is even a theme for this game, and the fact that the talking money *itself* is capable of insulting Conker by using cuss words (""You greedy b******"") is hilarious and even gives the game an overly goofy Earthworm Jim quality.  I also can't help but feel sadness for how dire the look on Conker's face becomes whenever he stumbles into a really bad situation (which is often hence the ""bad fur day"").  He's so adorable and yet, due to the wonderful animations and lively facial expressions, you can't help but feel sorry for him.

It's not just Conker with all this personality being shown.  ALL the characters manage to be highly enjoyable.  The mound of poop, the mob boss guy, the talking broken pitchfork, the cow with the squirts, Conker's valley girl-like girlfriend, the adorable talking hand puppet at the end with such an innocent/adorable voice... just about everybody has their own personality in this game so no character is weak.  The storyline is very easy to follow and intended for adults given all the swearing and sexual situations, and the emphasis on being creative is top priority.  Let me explain the creativity aspect-

In addition to fighting a huge fecal spitting ball of poop deep within a cave and drunkenly peeing on the bad guys, the game takes it's cue from the Earthworm Jim formula by assuring every new area of exploration offers a radically different obstacle that, believe it or not, actually serves as a storyline advancement.  All these outrageous events actually tie together.  You will find yourself riding bulls and plowing the fecal matter out of female cows, battling overweight cavemen, riding on hover boards to collect money, retrieving beehives to help a lonely sad bee desperate for help, turning into a bat and dropping critters into a grinder, shooting moaning zombie squirrels inside a graveyard, nervously carrying dangerous bombs to the next destination, helping a pitchfork stab bales of hay, exploring a haunted house for keys and more zombie shooting fun, entering a VERY chaotic war scene later on (which is when the games difficulty boosts significantly), carefully figuring your way through red explosive laser beams and oh... that brings me to the next point.

The second half of this game is mainly a succession of popular movie or video game references such as the Clockwork Orange, the Terminator, Saving Private Ryan, Metal Gear Solid, Medal of Honor, Alien, Matrix-style slow motion effects (not a fan of this one to be honest even though the parody is spot-on, but that's probably because I've never been a fan of the movie) and probably several more I never caught.  This game has it all and more.  You can NOT get bored with a game like Conker's Bad Fur Day.  You'd never guess by the cutscene in the very beginning when Conker's sitting around in a grumpy mood about to explain the day he went through just had BAD it really was!

Challenge-wise this game can be downright insanely difficult.  This is actually due to the level of goofiness reaching a point that it occasionally interferes with understanding the objectives at hand.  More than occasionally- at least half of the time.  Nothing's obvious with a game like this.  If you've ever played Earthworm Jim you'll know what to expect, but of course Earthworm Jim never set out to be vulgar and inappropriate which is why this is clearly not a kids game whereas Earthworm Jim is allowed to pass for one (though believe it or not I actually remember a time when Earthworm Jim was considered questionable for the younger crowd- never could figure out why).  Also the play control is often strange and you'll be spending time figuring out how to move certain objects such as army tanks later on in order to line up ideal necessary shots, and several other things throughout the game.

Every character has a cute, almost British-like voice too, which is another element of deception taking place here.  Forget everything I said about the Nintendo 64 being inferior to the Playstation One.  Had I played Conker's Bad Fur Day as my first N64 choice I'd probably have had a different reaction.  Conker's Bad Fur Day HAS to be owned!",negative

3302,"I won't get into much detail, you can check any gamers web page and check the reviews and they will probably do a better job than I would trying to describe the game. So, I will only talk for myself here. I love the game, It's really hard, but its extremely rewarding once you kill the boss or foe that was making your life hell. The multilayer is fun an simple, the story is weak but honestly you won't mind.

If you like a changeling game, than this is for you. For me, its a must have game.",positive
3303,"Deus Ex, in my book, is the game of the year. The replay value is tremendous. The different ways you can build your character allow a curiosity to replay the game in a different fashion than you may have started with. The game is very flexible in how you approach the goals given to you in each stage.
The ability to upgrade different skills allows you to explore more areas. Exploring more areas gives you bonus points to further upgrade, and so on. The better you play, the better your character becomes.
The various weapons are quite useful, and upgradeable, with mods and skill upgrades, thus becoming very acuarate and powerful. The GEP gun and sniper rifle are a couple of my favorites.
The game has a nice layout for the toolbelt and augments. The augments are found throughout the game, and allow you to upgrade your body. (vision, cloak, speed, etc.) Depending on how you pick these out you will have certain advantages/disadvantages in certain scenarios. This was very well thought out. (replay value) Deus Ex takes notes for you! What a time saver. Press F2 and check out what you learned.
I have no major quarrels with this game except that I wish the sniper rifle had a tripod mod. 8) The game does seem to take quite a few resources. I'm runnning a 733 @ 133Mhz bus with 128MB, and I can't push the graphics too hard. Even with the Geforce 32MB. I make sure to kill other tasks before launch. The only other con I've noticed is the dialect in close up talk with other characters seems a litte ""Godzilla-ish"", but it's no big deal.
Deu Ex gets major thumbs up from me. Great visual quality. Multiple ending options, none of which I've selected yet. (I'm right at the decision point.) Great sound, save the affore mentioned ""Godzilla-ish"" thing. Many ways to complete tasks. Easy game play. Lastly, good replay value, which is now more enhanced due to a multiplayer patch available from the Deus Ex web-site.
If you like FPS games, and you do not have Deus Ex yet... Shame on you. Get a move on!",positive

3305,"Naughty Dog is one of the video game industrys best developers in my opinion. They are notable for their classic platformer games, Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, and their cinematic trilogy Uncharted. More recently, they were known for their masterpiece of a game, The Last of Us. While not every game they make is amazing, I honestly believe that few developers have maintained such a high level of quality in their games for as long as they have. It is also very interesting to see how their games maturity levels have evolved. With Crash and the first Jak game, they were kid-friendly games meant for all ages, but the later Jak games and Uncharted were for more a teen/young adult audience (although almost any age can enjoy them). With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog released their first truly dark game and it is arguably their most popular game yet, both critically and commercially. With Uncharted 4, Naughty Dog has crafted one of the most beautiful, touching, and fun games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

 Obviously, Im a pretty big fan of Naughty Dog, but I think that in order to understand where Im coming from with this review, I should mention what I think about their previous games, specifically the Uncharted series. When I first played Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, I thought (and still think) it was a solid third-person shooter with gorgeous (at the time) visuals and fun characters. Uncharted 2, however, was on a completely different level and is still, 8 years after its release, one of the best games I have ever played. The characters were written better, the visuals were even more impressive, the set pieces were huge, and the pacing was phenomenal, meaning you were almost never bored when playing. While Uncharted 3 didn't have that same leap as from the first to second game, it was still a great game in my eyes and probably my second favorite of the trilogy, even if the pacing was a little off in the first half of the game. So, with that out of the way, lets get on to the meat of the review, starting with the gameplay.

 Despite what Ive heard from many people, mostly those who haven't played the games, the Uncharted series has always had changes to its gameplay with each entry. Not all of them are great or noticeable at first, but when you play the games back-to-back, you begin to appreciate the subtleties a lot more. With this game, one of the biggest additions to the game is the rope. By simply holding the L1 button, Nathan will start swinging his rope around and if there are any spots to grapple, releasing the button will allow him to hook onto it. It is a very simple and intuitive mechanic, allowing for not only Tarzan-like movements, but also some very cool takedowns on enemies; try getting into a gunfight, running away, jumping off of a ledge, grappling midair, and then jumping again off of the rope to land a fist in your enemies face. Moments like those are what make the rope so satisfying and it was one of the best additions to the gameplay.

 Speaking of taking out your enemies, the melee system is also the best in the entire series, taking the best parts from Uncharted 3 and removing the worst. For example, one of my favorite additions to the third games combat was having Nathan automatically take an enemys weapon from them if you had none, which returns here. On the other hand, my least favorite addition was the grab move, as it made combat needlessly frustrating since rolling and grabbing were the same button (leading to way too many deaths for this player). So, what did they do? They removed the ability to grab, which is fine by me. Usually, going in for a melee kill will require you to just mash the square button, but every once in a while, youll have to perform a counter move with the triangle button, which is very easy to do, but it is cool to see the different animations during the game, especially when they are Naughty Dog quality. In addition to the combat being improved, the gunplay has also been changed for the better.

 The best part, hands down, is the ability to pick up ammo with the triangle button and the ability to pick up weapons by holding down the same button. This means that you can walk across the battlefield while tapping triangle and not have to worry about accidentally picking up a gun you don't like, like in previous games. I don't see why you cant just automatically pick up ammo, but it is still a welcome change. This is especially helpful because this games combat has a lot more emphasis on mobility. With the previous Uncharted games, you usually just wanted to stay in cover and shoot your enemies, but with this game, almost all cover is destructible and since you cant throw back grenades (which doesnt hurt the gameplay at all), you always need to be moving. With the quick melee kills and fun rope swinging, this new approach to combat works very well and makes for some of the most enjoyable fights in the entire series. But, I think my favorite part of the combat would have to be the greater emphasis on stealth.

 Make no mistake, the stealth in this game is no Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell, but it is fun and satisfying nonetheless. Like the previous games, you can automatically sneak around when you reach a new area and you can silently take out enemies using the square button, usually by pulling them off of ledges or sneaking behind them. This works just as well as it did before, but there are few new features that make it more satisfying. First, there are now locations for you to hide in, which is usually just tall grass or foilage. This works perfectly because you can still move around in it and they are conveniently located around, so it makes sneaking about much easier. Second, you can now mark enemies by aiming at them and clicking a button; doing this will put a small arrow above their head that will let you always know their location, which is not only very useful in stealth scenarios, but also in combat when you are trying to figure out how to flank enemies. Finally, your partners can help you by sometimes taking out enemies that are in the way  granted, this doesnt happen often, but I did notice it. Like The Last of Us, your allies cant be detected and although this might break the immersion for some players, I prefer this over the alternate methods of not having backup or having them able to get caught. Overall, Im very pleased with the combat improvements in the game, but the game also has more exploration to it.

 Although the series is called Uncharted, implying that you are exploring uncharted areas, the series is known for being extremely linear, but Ive never had a problem with that in the series, as I think it helps the games maintain their high-quality. That being said, this game is a lot more open-ended. Instead of having levels featuring only one way to proceed, there are sometimes two or three ways of climbing somewhere, especially towards the latter half of the game. Again, the game is still linear, but compared to the other games, this game does have a different way of designing levels. Two of the 22 chapters actually feature levels that you can explore for quite a long time without progressing at all  one of these with a jeep in Madagascar and the other is with a boat out in the ocean. While I have always loved the linear levels, I think that these couple levels are a nice change of pace. As long as they don't take over the entire game, which they dont, Im OK with these. The only problem I have with these areas are the lack of good rewards for exploring  you usually only receive the silly treasures that have been a trademark in the series, but sometimes you get a better reward, which brings me to discussing the collectibles in the game.

 As I just mentioned, the treasures from previous games return, and they are as annoying as ever. Unlike Uncharted 3, they do give you points for collecting them (used to buy post-game rewards such as skins, weapons, render modes, and modifiers), so they can be useful, but they are just so boring to look for and collect, which is why I just use a guide for my second playthrough and never bother with them again. However, the game yet again takes inspiration from The Last of Us in providing artifacts to collect, this time being called journal entries; these pages provide some interesting backstory on the games events and make exploring worth it. I usually had fun exploring regardless of the rewards, but I enjoyed collecting the journal notes and entries far more than collecting the almost-meaningless treasures. Unfortunately, there are about twice as many treasures as there are journal entries and notes, so you won't always be receiving an intriguing note. There are also optional conversations  again, these are just like they were in The Last of Us, and I enjoy hearing these little side talks the characters have. These new types of collectibles are what makes this game achieve a 15-hour length, but I don't think that it is just padding; I enjoy exploring and learning about characters and their world, so it is time well spent.

 Before I dive into the story, I just want to quickly mention that in some pre-release footage, the game showed that you could make choices in the game during select conversations. These only appear three times in the story and are completely pointless, changing the story in no way and only affecting those three select lines in the game. Im guessing that Naughty Dog included these as a sort of test for themselves to see if they would ever be able to make a game with branching storylines, but it doesnt affect the game in any negative way here, so theres nothing to worry about. Just pick the lines you think are the best and move on with the game. Now, on to the story!

 One of the most notable aspects of this games story is that it is much darker and realistic than previous entries  the main menu starts with ambient noise and a video of a dead pirate in a cage, which is quite different from the triumphant menus of the previous games. Obviously, the game is still very unrealistic with its set pieces and Nate being a God at fighting an army, but it terms of characterization, this is different than the original games. Dont misunderstand me, the characters are still the same people weve grown to love, but there is something less fictional about them. I attribute this difference to the change of writers; Amy Hennig was the creative director/head writer for the previous games, while Neil Druckmann was the creative director/head writer for The Last of Us and this game. Different people have different tastes and although I love Hennigs superb writing in the previous games, I honestly prefer Druckmanns writing in these past two games. Having characters with more emotion and more realistic interactions makes me feel more emotionally involved with them. The game also has a slower pace, which allows for more character development. One of my favorite scenes has Nate sit down with his brother, Sam, and just talk. This conversation is completely optional, but it adds so much to both of their characters and something like that wouldve never happened with Hennig as a writer. Im not trying to criticize her, as she is still one of my favorite writers, but I do prefer Druckmann.

 I did mention that the game is slower paced and for the most part, this works in the games favor. The beginning chapters are particularly slow, but I think chapter four more than makes up for it  it is just a short chapter that shows what a normal life is for Nate and Elena, and it is this exact realism that allows for some of the best dialogue in the entire series. However, there were a couple times throughout the game where the slow pacing worked against the game, most notably during the two Scotland chapters. These areas weren't bad chapters, but after being roughly one-third of the way through the game, it was just getting to be a little much. Thankfully, I think the pacing gets back on track once you get out of there. As Ive mentioned before, the pacing is still slower than the previous games, but the greater emphasis on the story and characters make it worth it in my opinion.

 So, now Im just going to mention a few tidbits about the story that I like, but I don't want to go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil anything. First, I mentioned that the journal entries allow for some great backstory to be inserted into the game, and I know this has been said in many other reviews, but it is amazing at how Uncharted 4 not only has a great main narrative, but also a great subplot with Henry Avery and the pirates. You don't need to collect journal entries to understand it, as it is addressed in the main game, but collecting it adds so much more depth and makes you feel like you, not Nathan Drake, are actually uncovering history - I love it. Second, Rafe Adler is, by far, the best villain in the series  you love to hate him. He can be charismatic and suave one minute, but the next minute, he is flipping out on you and going into a psychotic rant. Most of the villains in the series were clichs; well clichs with fun performances, but clichs nonetheless. While Rafe does have some tropes, such as being a spoiled rich boy, the game makes him remarkably three-dimensional and he is just one of the best written characters in the series  he steals every scene he is in and for my first playthrough, I was always one the edge of my seat when he appeared, wondering what he would do next. The only thing that I will say about the story is that, just like the other games, there are probably some plot holes or inconsistencies, but if you don't overthink it, youll still be sucked in and love it.

 The last thing that I want to mention about the story is the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will mention that when I first beat the game, I was very conflicted on how I felt about it. However, after beating the ending a second time, I realized how much I appreciated the way Naughty Dog ended the series  it was a really fitting end for the series. So, even if you don't appreciate it your first time through, you will most likely grow to like it as time passes by.

 Another quick tidbit that I want to mention is the music. My God, the music! A lot of people were worried when Greg Edmonson, the composer for the original trilogy, wasn't returning for this game, but I can safely say that Henry Jackman fills his shoes nicely. I won't say that he is better, because music is probably the most subjective art form, but I definitely loved his score in this game and found him to be a suitable replacement. Again, this is probably just me, but Im confident that most people would like this score. The tracks For Better or Worse (played in chapter 17, which has the same name) and The Twelve Towers (played during many combat encounters in the game) are particularly noteworthy. Bravo, Mr. Jackman, bravo!

 Before I conclude, I must again mention something that I think is very important: chapters 17 through 20 and the final chapter (22) are some of the best batch of levels in any game Ive ever played. Without spoiling anything, Im just going to say that chapter 17 has the best character interactions in the series and it rivals what was done in The Last of Us (which is kind of a big deal); chapter 18 has the best scene in the series and one of the best in gaming in general (this scene involves a dining table and youll probably know it when you see it); chapter 19 has the best creepy atmosphere since the Spaniard levels in the original game; and chapter 20 has probably the best gunfights in the series. These are all amazing feats and the game ends with the best boss battle in the series (not that that is saying much, but it is fun). Because Uncharted is so focused on story and characters, it is very difficult to describe why these parts of the game are so great, but if youve ever wanted a story that has the realistic writing of The Last of Us with the gameplay of Uncharted, this game is it. If youve played the three main games, you owe it to yourself to finish the series off with the best game in the series  I put it on equal grounds with the second game (Uncharted 2 has better pacing, but this game has a better story to make up for it). So, go buy this masterpiece right now and, as the great Victor Sullivan would say, have a helluva time.",positive

Another great thing about it is that it's not too short, it keeps you playing for quite a while with it's many bosses. This is definitely one of my best games.",positive

3315,"Diablo 3 has been one of those games that has been labelled as garbage and it's really a shame. I believe there are three main complaints against the game:

1)Real Money Auction House
People feel that this breaks the game because others can come in with real money, do half the work, and be ready to take on the mobs in Inferno.

First off, no. You can have the BEST gear in the game, and still get your butt handed to you in Inferno, even with the recent patches (I've played since day 1). Navigating through mobs in Inferno takes skill, patience, and practice; regardless of gear. Anyone who claims that a person can just spend $X dollars in the RMAH, get to Inferno level, and beat it - hasn't played Inferno. In fact, I believe this is why Blizzard did not put the RMAH in Hardcore. You realize how much money they could of made? Things in Hardcore are worth MUCH more than Softcore - yet greedy, horrible Blizzard left the RMAH out. Why? Because they clearly say that under NO circumstance will you get your character back. Could you IMAGINE the number of morons who would blow hundreds of dollars on HC characters, thinking it would buy them a one-way ticket to dominating Inferno difficulty, then lose their character(money) and FREAK! RMAH being withheld from the Hardcore server was a move where Blizzard chose to not deal with annoyed customers over money - a genuinely greedy company wouldn't of cared, wouldn't of passed out on the cash cow that RMAH HC could be.
Secondly, being mad that someone who works the 9 to 5 and wants to spend some of their hard earned cash on a few items (or more) to make them feel more powerful in game is just insane. It's THEIR money! ""But I worked hard without money to get all of this gear!"" Well, good for you! *slow clap* And Jack/Jill works hard to get money that they can spend how they want. Get a job, you'll know what I mean when I say that sometimes you don't have the time to farm (even if you'd like to) but you really want to catch up with your friends that are on Inferno MP-6. For the record, I've never used the RMAH- yet I still respect those that make the choice to use it.

2)Always Online/Server Error at Launch
Always online is a feature that many games were forcing long before Diablo (and soon consoles will be forcing it, too). Is it annoying? Sure, but so are taxes on my paycheck. But at the end of the day, no one want's to get ripped off. And while you may not like that you can't play Diablo on your laptop during your wifi absent family vacation, Blizzard doesn't like that pricks out their steal something they worked hard to make. Granted, you have the right to not like the always-online rule, but to DOWNVOTE it is an unfair marker of the games quality - you're essentially saying, ""Even if this was the best game ever made, because it forces me to always be online, I recommend you don't buy it."" Plus, I don't want to deal with security issues/hackers/bugs to the game, and alway-online is one way to fight against this. Sucks for you, but I am the one playing the game at the end of the day.
Error at Launch... Ugh, get over it. It was a mistake. It sucked. And I couldn't play Diablo 3 for 12 hours. Am I the ONLY person who is not a game-addict here?! The other sentiment is that, ""I paid for it and couldn't play it!"" Firstly, read your terms of service that you accept. Secondly, how often has an employer paid you on the hour while you were texting, goofing off, etc? Big deal, we're human. Mistakes happen. It wasn't consistent.

3)Grinding/It's Just Not the Same
REALLY?! Does no one remember how much a grind fest Diablo 1/2 could be? Less variety in gear might of meant less grinding, but the expense is less variety! It's a dungeon crawler... Of all the complaints I read/hear about the game, I RARELY see ""it wasn't fun"", ""the characters suck"", ""the skills suck"", etc. Aka, I RARELY see actual negativity towards the key component - general game play. Too me, it's lest of a one-track grind than Diablo 1/2 by FAR due to the increase in A.I. When I'm playing HC on my lv 60-3 at Inferno, I'm always encountering new situations where my heart begins to race as I know the fight is on and my character could bite the dust any moment now.
Humans have a tendency to look on the past with an exaggerating positive light. This isn't my theory, it's fact. Actually listened to a recent TED talk about. Ever had a ex bf/gf/friend, where you find yourself missing them until a friend or some other circumstance makes you realize, ""Wow, it was never as good as I thought it was..."" Diablo 1/2 are GREAT. AMAZING! BRILLIANT! I will always hold them near to my heart, as I played them as a child during a time where they brought a lot of stress-relief to my life and allowed me to bond with my cousin of the same age as we played. I will always owe Diablo 1/2 some of my sanity, and I could never betray that game. That being said, when you try and compare the feelings of nostalgia banked by playing D/D2 with the present gameplay of D3, of course Diablo 3 is going to fail- miserably. But anyone who takes an honest assessment of what makes a game a game - gameplay, A.I., story, visuals, depth, etc will see that D3 is a MAJOR improvement. Everyone knows that, hypothetically, if Diablo 3 was the ""perfect"" game, it still would have failed because it just can't live up to the unrealistic expectations of being a game that is in your heart and has been there for years. It's impossible.

That being said, I really like the game for the GAME itself.",negative
3316,Phenomenal game for it's time. I've never played anything better. (Outside of the Fire Emblem series.),negative
3317,"This is one of the best games out there, it's a classic. Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome. Buy it you won't regret it.",neutral

After reading some reviews and hearing good things from friends, I decided to pick this game up for $25 and have been enthralled with it ever since. I've completed almost everything in the game and have loved every minute of it. This game is probably one of my top 5 favorite games ever. If you like Pirates and Video Games, give this a go! It doesn't get bogged down by the AC story line, it is truly open world, and you essentially get to live out your Pirate fantasy. The controls are occasionally really annoying.",positive
3323,excellent,negative
3324,"It's a very fun and interesting game. The only major flaws I find are:

The flying system can be quite annoying if you're trying to win all the flying races. Some characters seem to be able to fly faster or smoother than others. The rest seems to be pure luck, timing, and maneuverability.

Some of the characters were either completely pointless once you unlock them like Mastermind or powered-down in the game like Emma Frost.
They were missing characters such as Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Vision and Ultron (though they might save them for the sequel around the time of Avengers: Age of Ultron). But other choices could have been the Enchantress, the Executioner, Red She-Hulk/Betty Ross, Moondragon and more.
Other characters were given questionable qualities like Black Cat who isn't as acrobatic as Black Widow or Elektra in this game and having an almost useless grappling hook that doesn't even let her swing like Spider-Man (like it does in the comics).
Also it seemed ridiculous for symbiote Spider-Man to be limited to DLC and not in the main game since it's his second most popular look aside from his classic look. Plus, while I know the Guardians of the Galaxy film came out long after this game was released, it would have been nice to get the film versions of their film costumes as DLC at some point (especially their initial individual looks and later red jumpsuits as a team).
Also some characters have full flight like Thor and Iron Man while others can only hover and gradually descend such as Jean Grey, Storm and Magneto. While I can understand Jean having only the ability to hover, Storm not being able to fly as high and fast as Thor is laughable given they both can control the weather (one can argue its because, while hovering, Storm can put out fires, but she can already throw tornadoes that do the EXCACT SAME THING, smh).",positive

3331,"You know you scored big when Sony quickly tries to copy your success. I've had the Wii for a couple years now and I have been nothing more than impressed. Nintendo continues to be the biggest innovator of the gaming world. Sure they may not be your huge gamer platforms, but they are the most consistent gaming company in my opinion. Yes Playstation and Xbox are both very good platforms, but they don't go out on a limb like Nintendo does. I remember when the Wii came out many people said a double controller console would fail, but as usual Nintendo delivered (as they did on ever console they've made). Come late 2012 I will be investing in their newest creation, the Wii U. They have not failed me yet, so I'm sticking with these guys.

The games on Wii are very fun. They are not overly complicated, but still very entertaining. If your a gamer that needs tons of graphics and lots of high tech games, go with the Xbox and Plystation. Though the Wii is my favorite and the most entertaining to me, I fully under stand that it lacks in the newest tech race.

All this being said, I fully recommend the Nintendo Wii. I have every Nintendo console I've ever owned since I was 5, so scooping up a Wii now (even though late) will still serve as a great investment.",positive

3337,"I love this game because it offers a great new take on the snowboarding video games. While SSX is a very fun game to play, it is very over the top and everything seem to revolve around doing the most ridiculous stunts you can pull off as often as possible no matter what you're doing. That and the levels can be very linear with bottomless pits scattered all over the place, it can get a little old after a while.

Stoked is a nice alternative, the physics feel very realistic, and everything about it is quite similar to the Skate series. Basically, there are various mountains, you select a mountain, select your drop point, and you are free to go wherever you want and do whatever you want. The game has a very laid back style to it, and the structure is very open world. This is one of the only snowboarding games that I have ever played that truly captures the feel of snowboarding in real life, where you are free to go wherever you want on a mountain and simply explore. The controls feel like a mix between Skate and 1080 snowboarding for the N64, where it can be a lot of fun to simply race around and tricks need to be performed off various objects and jumps throughout the mountain, no ollie back flips here! Much like skate, you can't perform ridiculous stunts all over the place, most of the time the best tricks you can perform will be double black flips and 900's, pulling a 1080 is quite the feat in this game, and most of the time you will be performing 360's, 540's, back flips and a mctwist, which keeps everything feeling quite realistic, especially for a snowboarding game. In fact I would say this is the most realistic snowboarding game I have played since ESPN showboarding on PS2, and this game is definitely better than that considering the fact that the level design as well as the controls are a lot better.

The graphics could have been better, but considering the fact that this was a relatively low budget video game they are good enough and get the job done. The level design is excellent and the open world aspect is easily the most appealing thing about it. The weather changes along with the time of day in the various mountains which is a pretty cool feature that keeps it feeling fresh, I especially liked the snowflake effects while you are snowboarding on a mountain while it is snowing. Overall I am very impressed with this game and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an open world snowboarding game. The menus are very well laid out, and once you load a mountain the loading between runs is very smooth and fast, so I am very impressed with the presentation. There is basically nothing else like this on the market, which is why I am giving it 5 stars, it is a great concept that is very well executed. If you enjoyed Skate and have been looking for a snowboarding game with that style of realistic open world gameplay, look no further.",positive

3343,"Ratchet & Clank, what a game! I bought this merely by reading the reviews of it and I have to say, I was not disappointed. Think of him sort of like Mega man. Ratchet has a wide array of weapons that are diverse and work for multiple tasks, of course, once you start getting the better weapons you'll want to stick with them, but it doesn't hurt to have the weaker ones on your arsenal. Work your way through a decent amount of levels, blasting and shooting your enemies to find bosses and rewards that lead you to the creature who wants to destroy planets in order to create his own (I can't remember his name). The game also provides you with extra fun things to do, such as finding golden bolts (which, later in the game, can help you get a better, more powerful weapon) and skill points, such as completing x/y task in a certain amount of time, or not being hit or destroying flying saucers or landing in a certain place. I'd suggest that, before you finally beat the game, you use an online walkthrough and look for everything you've missed, be it golden bots or skills points, not only will it make the game longer, but you'll also collect bolts for the must have RYNO, expensive but oh so worth it weapon. Other than that it's a game worth buying, and don't be scared that it may be a little old (since it actually have 3 other ones) the game offers you great graphics, humor and fun.",neutral

3347,"About 10-12 years ago I sank untold hours into my first online games -- both from Blizzard interestingly -- Starcraft and Diablo 2. I bought Starcraft 2 and HOTS when they came out, but due to mixed reviews and my lack of a powerful enough computer (over the years I became a console gamer), I skipped D3. My curiosity was stirred when RoS released with rave reviews, including the releases on X360 & PS3. I was very tempted to pick up the 360 version even after picking up my PS4, but I waited as I had heard rumors the excellent console port would make its way to the PS4.

I am glad I waited and even more glad I bought this game. When RoS came out I tried the Starter Edition on my now better computer, but it lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. Whatever it lacked, the console version made up for it and far exceeded my expectations. Simple searches across forums and reviews will all tell you the same thing; even many seasoned-PC gamers who took the plunge on this console version agree the PS4 version trumps the PC counterpart. From the minute I powered it up on my Sony platform, my days of Diablo 2 glory were immediately rekindled like hanging out with an old friend you haven't seen for years. Instantly, that old, addicting loot-fest done so well in D2 arose in a new, fresh way to make D3 a game I will be putting many, many hours into (much to my beautiful wife's chagrin).

To keep this review concise, here are my pros/cons:

PROS
+ 1080p, 60 fps is gorgeous and smooth as butter to play.
+ The controls feel completely natural on console as all the necessary buttons are in close proximity; Elective Mode means you can even customize which abilities go to which buttons you prefer.
+ Loot is almost always class-focused, so just about everything you find is wieldable for the character you are playing.
+ Adventure Mode offers procedurally-generated dungeons and, thus, endless replayability; this is the mode almost everyone plays after clearing the campaign.
+ Frequent auto-saves mixed with the condensed controls/inventory system make the game ridiculously easy to pick up and play.
+ Couch co-op means fun when your friends are over, and online co-op means fun with friends (or anyone) at any time.
+ Unique Nemesis system sends the Monster that kills your friends in their games to your world wherever you are. Kill the Monster for huge rewards, or die by the Monster and it'll travel to another friends' world even more powerful!
+ Audio is phenomenal on surround sound. So much bass!
+ Loot, loot and more loot!

CONS
- PvP is ridiculously weak. One of my best memories was ganking kids in D2. However, D3 is so good it doesn't detract from my personal rating.
- Story is not engaging at all.
- Some voice acting frequently detracts from the dark atmosphere
- No way to log/track hours played per character. Hoping this one changes.

This isn't just a game for Blizzard fans or Action RPG fans. This is an excellent game for any PS4 owner's library!",positive
3348,"Okay lets get a couple of the negative things out in the open before I start this review. Yes if you're running on Vista or 7 32 bit youll prolly experience memory problems. But as a vista 32 bit user myself I found this link that helped me with my memory situation;

[...]

I know it won't fix everyone's problems if they experience any but thats worth a try along with updating graphics drivers. Those are a couple of things that I found really helped with my stabilty in game and the last couple of patches have optimized the epansion areas.

But overall as a consumer I am really impressed with the leaps and strides Funcom has made with the expansion.  The new areas are lavishly detailed and rendered wonderfully.  The end level areas are vast and open different challenges.  If you think you can go in there without being properly geared or skilled by youself think again.  This is what I really like about this new expansion, it offers more of a challenge and the six man dungeons offer tons of entertainment and have a Godslayer mode that offers even better rewards.

Even though there isn't new levels the Alternate Advancment System offers new talents, perks, and abilities that can now diverisfy different players and their skills.  It can be a bit of a grind but this is what they are doing instead of new levels.  In my opinion its the same premise as getting new levels and is still a way to progress your already  maxed out character.  From a PVPer's perspective though, this is probably the only thing thats been added to cater to the pvp side of the game.  But even though its the only thing its a pretty big addition.

Now the game has factions along with a new race, there are about twelve factions and you can join a total of seven. With each faction comes different quests for the areas and dungeons that offer faction points that reward you with tokens and faction levels that offer you new gear.  This can offer a lot of depth as who you want to join, some factions may give you the armor you want, but another might have a mount or pet or weapon youd like just as much.  Theres even a betrayl system implemented that lets you backstab your faction to join an opposing one. Be careful though, this won't let you switch on the fly and requires a lot of work.

I do not consider myself a jaded gamer and this game isn't perfect, but I don't find this expansion ""grindy"" in the slightest. It is what you make of it, you can grind the same quests if you want like i tried, but as I did that my friends were out exploring doing different dungeons and quests that I was missing.  Theres plenty to do without feeling tedious, but again thats up to the player and his or her guild.  But there are flaws, one obvious one is the above stated memory problem for 32 bit users, I and many others have found solutions to fix our problems but the game still needs to look into that.  Also a major PVPer myself I find this expansion not catering much to the pvpers, though the patches prior to the expansion did add extra PVP levels and gear.

Aside from the few problems I am loving this expansion and am definitly getting my money's worth. This game is not AION or WoW, so if you're coming from there and expecting the same you might want to change your mindset to enjoy the game.  Different doesnt always mean bad :)",positive

The new Hawk features a much greater quantity and variety in the way of level goals to keep things interesting. Plus, now there are different types of competitions included in every level instead of a couple of levels dedicated to competition. Best of all, this one has a fully fleshed-out online mode (as opposed to THPS3's prototypical one).
Hilarious characters and in-game gags are all over the place, and there is even the addition of the ""skitching"" move, pioneered by Michael J.

If you enjoy rpg's and you like the look of Secret of Evermore (my favorite) or Final Fantasy III then you will like this game too.
There is a good size world to investigate, and I did like the time factor and seeing the differences it made to the terrain and the new people to talk to. I can see why people give it a perfect score, and why it would be near and dear to some people. That is why I say at the top that I think scoring has to do with when you play a game.

I can type a slight bit faster on these keyboards than other keyboards (which is saying something since I figured I had capped out).

  The memory functions for the G keys is fun, I like to create simple loops to help my hands in WoW. Likewise being able to turn the windows button off is super helpful. Other keys can be mapped in programs to do other things as well (like the media keys up top).

  The screen uses LUA scripting now, I don't really play with it but I like being able to see the time at the drop of a hat.

  My complaints though are two fold, small but problems still.

  The legs that the keyboard stands with are extremely fragile and Logitech doesn't stock replacements (I'd have been willing to buy them) and the keys themselves are extremely fragile around the bottom edges. I was removing them to clean the keyboard, something I've done with roughly a hundred keyboards (it was one of those jobs folks suckered us into a lot at CC and BB...yeah I worked at both in the last five or so years :( ), and the alt key shattered like I had pried at it with a crowbar! I was shocked and very disheartened.

  These keys also cannot be replaced, you'd have to replace the entire keyboard which is a supreme shame. I'd be willing to spend 50 cents to a dollar per key on this sort of thing. I'm sure others would too.

  Otherwise! It is a fantastic keyboard, I have been using it for quite a while now and really don't see the purpose of using any other keyboard.",neutral

3362,"As with all modern console gamepad chargers, this is your basic USB charger cable, which means it's compatible with anything utilizing this exact combination of inputs (basic USB 2.0 on one end and Micro USB on the other). The length of the cable makes it viable for playing games while charging, or just playing with a nonstop wired connection, if that is your preference. It will also allow the connecting of a PS4 or Xbox One gamepad to a PC (either with Window 10 installed or with the correct drivers on an older operating system), although users should be aware that the DS4 Windows program is required to translate PS4 inputs into Xbox input format for many games. The program in question is freeware that can be found through a simple Internet search and isn't a hassle to set up at all, but it requires mentioning if one hopes to use a PS4 controller to play PC games.",positive
3363,"I love this thing more than I thought I would. It seems to be difficult to find a decent carrying case for a good price that'll actually hold your games. Before, I had a different case of inferior material and had to buy little plastic carrying cases for my games. But with this, I can keep them all in one place.
The upper part has a little net for a charger, or a screen cleaner, or a carrying case for games if you end up using up all the game pockets. It's got a good amount of space and offers more storage than even some officially licensed Nintendo carrying cases.

The pockets can be awkward when removing games from them at times. If it's a second row beneath a first row, the games above the other games can make it weird. But the pockets have elastic, so it's easy to get around. A small nitpick if anything.

The area for the 3DS itself is great. I love how the game holders add extra security. The backside of the one closest to the 3DS itself is soft, just as the inside is, so you don't have to worry about it scratching your system. It fits perfectly, even with a hard case on the system itself. And there's even an extra pocket underneath the 3DS space. I find this to be a great place for spare screen protectors and screen cleaners.
I also like the handy, detachable wrist strap that it comes with. I personally don't have a lot of use for it, but it's nice.
Plenty of storage, and well made. I'm a fan of the material, too. Any extra protection for a device with two very sensitive screens is great, and this case provides that. The outside seems to be water resistant, but I haven't put that to the test.

Don't have a 3DS? Well, a regular DS will fit in there, too. The only device from the DS family this thing won't tote is the 2DS. So the DS, DSi, and 3DS consoles will all work just fine in here. Although smaller ones may slide around a little.

I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who has a handheld from the 3DS family, unless it's a 2DS. Even if you don't have many games, the flaps that hold them make for good extra protection, so I consider it worth the investment.",positive
3364,"I've really loved Afterglow products, and this one is no exception.  I'm not a super hardcore gamer, but I'm by no means a casual one, either.  However I think this headset is good for both, or wherever you happen to lie on the spectrum.

The fit is really nice, it's comfortable and easy to use.  I use it and so does my kiddo, and we've both enjoyed it.  The sound quality is great, I've never had any issues with it so far, with hearing others or them hearing me.  (I have with some headsets in the past.)

It does exactly what it's supposed to do, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the quality.  I will definitely continue to purchase Afterglow products, they've always done really well for me.  I'd highly recommend this headset if you're in the market for your PS4.",positive
3365,"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was one of the most anticipated sequels ever, coming out only a year after it's predessor on the PS2, Grand Theft Auto III was released.  Of course, like any other video gamer, I ran out and bought Vice City on it's release date, brought it home, and played it like mad.  However, something happened with Vice City that didn't happen with GTA3.  For some strange reason, I became bored with the game, put it down, and left it...for a year.  Being the avid video game player that I am, I occupied my time with other games, and didn't give Vice City a second thought until my supply was running low again.  So almost out of pity I picked the game up again and began playing it.  It's a good thing I did.  What we have here is quite possibly the largest and most well made video game of all time, right up there with GTA3, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Devil May Cry.  The game follows the same format as GTA3, but there is so much more to do in Vice City, it's not even funny.  Side missions, toy car races, dirt bike races, selling drugs, buying landscape; Vice City has it all.  The game has more unique characters that it's predecessor, and develops one of the best, but predictable plots of gaming history.  Sure, your know what's gonna happen, but that doesn't mean the game isn't written well.  Tommy Vercetti offers a more unique and wider character than The Guy, as he was known in GTA3.  He's tough, he's mean, and he is fricken insane.  And now still, after all this, I'm not sure which GTA I like better for the PS2.  The scenery and city is better in GTA3.  I prefer the dark dreary landscape, as opposed to the light, colorful Miami scenery.  The story is better here, as are the characters, but the missions and gameplay are about the same.  Here's a compromise I think we can all agree on: the Grand Theft Auto series is the best available on any gaming system right now, and I look forward to the next install.

3368,"Note: This game was reviewed as if it was just released, using the PS3 version.

4 years ago, a company known as Team Ico released a game called Ico. There were differing opinions of whether or not the games artistic appeal and minimalistic story was worth the lack of gameplay and full story. The game, as a whole, received mostly positive reviews, with a score of 8.25/10 from me (4 stars). I enjoyed the atmosphere immensely, but thought that the gameplay and replay value was leaving much to be desired. Shadow of the Colossus, a spiritual successor to Ico, has rectified almost all of the problems that I originally had with Ico and not only continued with making a great atmospheric game, but also making it a fun game to play, with a lot more replay value than Ico. Shadow of the Colossus combines Icos artistic nature with the fun of video games to form a masterpiece.

What This Game is All About:
 The game is a spiritual successor and prequel to Ico, but don't let that trick you; the only noteworthy similarity, ignoring the ending (more on that later), is the atmosphere, which is still amazing. At the start of the game, you see your player character riding on a horse to a castle. When he arrives, he sets the body of a lifeless girl down (the relation is not stated). The castle is actually home to what seems to be a higher deity, and your character claims that this being has the power to resurrect people. The deity denies the request at first, but realizes that the character has an ancient sword, so it accepts. In order for the girl to be revived, Wander (the main character) must travel the Forbidden Land and defeat 16 colossi. Wander is warned that the price to be paid may be too high, but he accepts nonetheless. Thus, the adventure begins.

 The premise of the entire game is very simple: you ride around on your horse, Agro, and look for the 16 colossi to vanquish. The ancient sword that you wield is able to shine a light in the sky that points toward the next colossi. You go there and do your best to defeat it. That is pretty much what main game is about.

Gameplay:
 The gameplay is unique in that the entire game is centered on boss fights. In order to defeat a colossus, Wander has to find its weak spots and stab them with the ancient sword. After enough stabs to the weak point(s), the colossus will fall and release black energy things (what they are is revealed at the end of the story). After awakening back at the castle, Wander continues the journey. What makes them really special, however, is that as you progress throughout the game, you begin to think of the colossi not so much as bosses, but as levels. Each colossus is a puzzle and you have to figure out how to beat it, with most colossi requiring you to find a way to reveal its weak points. Each colossus is different from the last and it doesnt get boring because there are only 16. The sense of gratification from finally reaching a weak point and stabbing the colossus is amazing. Most of the time, the colossus will even try to shake you off and in order to stay alive, you must hold on to their fur. This adds another fun aspect to the game: stamina.

 The stamina meter in this game is possibly the most important aspect in regards to defeating a colossus. The longer you hold on to a colossus and the more violently it shakes, the more the meter drains. The game is unlike a lot of games that automatically grab. You have to choose when to grab and when to release if you want to stay on top. It is a fun aspect that I greatly enjoyed.

 When first starting the game, don't let the controls sway you from not wanting to continue. I struggled with them for a while, but once I started to change them to my preferences in the options menu, I loved them. For example, Agros steering controls started out as awful, but once I changed the button that made him run to one of the back buttons, I was able to control the horse almost flawlessly because I could run, steer, and control the camera at the same time, with that last part making a huge difference. Even though the controls are finicky in the beginning, they can be improved with some adjustments.

 While someones favorite colossus will vary greatly from person to person, I shall describe my favorite in order to give you the sense of sheer awesomeness that I was feeling. My favorite was the 5th colossus, which is a giant bird-like creature. By shooting an arrow at it, you attract its attention. When the bird is flying towards you, you have to jump at the right time and grab on to its wings. The rest of the battle is phenomenal, as you are flying through the sky as the bird is twisting and turning, trying to throw you off. In order to vanquish it, you must stab its wings until it is no more. Once you defeat it, you fall into the water below.

 Ive described almost all of the aspects of the gameplay and although it may not seem like a lot, it really doesnt matter, because the less is more approach made the game incredibly fun. This alone makes the game, in my opinion, far superior than Ico, as I found the game fun to play. Unlike that game, where the design was the only strong reason to play, this game also has fun gameplay. Nothing beats the feeling you get after making the final blow to that final colossus (I won't bother describing it, as the presentation alone is wonderful).

Story:
 In my review of Ico, I said that minimal amount of story was good because of the end, but because of the lack of any story in-between, it wasn't all that spectacular. While this game still lacks a lot of story for the middle part of the game, I felt that this games ending was a lot more satisfying and made the journey worth it, from a story perspective. It is great for people who haven't played Ico because it sets its own story, but it also has some aspects that draw from that games story, too. The end credits scene, specifically, shows the 2 games relationship, and it adds room for those who want to speculate without ruining it for other people. It is bittersweet, and I wasn't sure whether or not I should feel happy or sad. It was a wonderful moment and I liked it a whole lot more than Icos ending and I think that it deserves a spot on one of the greatest video game endings ever and it most definitely reaches the level of classic books and movies.

Design:
 Just like Ico, the game has wonderful atmosphere, but I think it is ever so slightly better because the game has more story. The sense of loneliness and despair as you travel throughout the land is awe-inspiring. There is also a great deal of sadness whenever you slay one of the beasts, as most of them don't even attack you until you attack them, and some don't even attack you at all. Not only are you absorbing the colossis black energy swirls (which seems to weaken Wander), but you are also destroying mostly peaceful beasts. Was it really worth it? Are you a monster yourself? When a game makes me think this way, you know that it is something special.

Sound:
 The sound in the game is also amazing, and it addresses one of the complaints that I had with Ico, which was that it was just a little too silent. This game only has music when you are fighting the colossi, so you get the sense of loneliness when traversing the land and the epic music when taking down a colossus. You get the best of both worlds.

Difficulty:
 The games difficulty is fine. It isn't too hard and the puzzles are mostly solvable without too much trouble, once you get the hang of it. Once you complete the game, there are optional Time Attack and Hard modes, so those are there for those who want an extra challenge. Speaking of Time Attack

Replay Value:
 The Time Attack mode gives this game more replay value not only by having you try to beat record times, but because for every 2 colossus times that you beat, you get a new item, and these items are different for both normal and hard. The items aren't the greatest unlockables ever, but they are still a nice treat. There are also Lizard Tails and Fruit to collect, but I barely encountered any, but I guess if you want to look for them, more power to you. The game also has a secret area, which is only accessible by maxing out Wanders stamina bar, which can be done by collecting the tails or beating the colossus in consecutive new game plus modes. It took me about 10 hours to complete the game, so even if you continue the new game plus modes, it isn't the longest lasting game, but it is more than worthy of replays anyway.

Final Judgment:
This game is RECOMMENDED. It has almost everything that a game needs in order to be considered a masterpiece, with no major flaws that are apparent. What this game accomplishes most, however, is the fact that it doesnt separate the art fans and video game fans like Ico; it combines them and should please them both. It truly is the next step for video games to be considered more than just button mashers (no disrespect intended toward fighting games). Go out and get this game.

3370,"As a ridiculously avid baseball fan I've always been pretty picky about my baseball games.  I never even considered buying anything but EA sports.  Unfortunately EA no longer makes MLB games. After recently purchasing a PS3 and being faced with the decision between MLB 2k7 and MLB ""The Show"" I began looking into features and gameplay video. I can honestly tell you w/o a doubt there is NO comparison whatsoever between the 2 games. ""The Show"" even has me saying...""wow, EA never had that"".  I mean everything you can dream up about being at the ballpark is in ""MLB 07"".  A special mention is the career mode. Design your own player facial hair, batting stance, and pick your stadium intro music. Then try to survive spring training for a shot at playing your favorite position for your favorite team. Fail and its back to AAA with you or worse....(Yes,there are tons of playable AAA teams) Also worth mention is the announcing and graphics, both top notch for any sports game on the market.  If you are a Baseball nut w/ a PS3 this is the one.",neutral

3372,"Long have the loyal Playstation fans awaited a game that was worthy of next gen and one to show off the capabilities of this great system. Uncharted lives up to the expectations and surpased! Not only is this game stunning, but it is FUN! If you have a PS3 you need to run out and get this game! You will not regret it.

Uncharted's gameplay is smooth, fun and inventive. Not only do you get a shooter game, but an adventure game with a very engaging story. It's like watching a movie that you are apart of. The game is so much fun, that you'll want to keep on playing it.

For the casual gamer you might find that the easy and normal settings are just right. The shooting of enemies will seem frustrating as unless you get a perfect headshot these guys aren't going to go down rigt away. Although sometimes I thought enemies were pushing their luck with how many times I shot them, it kept the game going and I never really got stuck as to where I was frustrated. There are different solutions to the shoot outs -- such as shooting barrels etc.

I don't want to spoil everything for you but you will ride jet ski's and shoot rocket launchers and kick butt in every single way. If you get tired of shooting an enemy or you run out of bullets you can run over and beat the guy, knock his head into some stone, steal his bullets and shoot the rest of his pirate pals.

There have been a lot of games that I regret spending $[...] dollars on, but this one is definately one I am happy with. Hours of game play, unlockables, and just a lot of fun. I look forward to other Drake titles and what Naughty Dog has in store for the the PS3",positive

3378,"Golden Sun is easily the best GBA RPG, having amazing graphics, great sounds, a solid story, and a challenging world.  The game is REDICULOUSLY long.  It makes you wonder how they fit a 30+ hour (no, I'm not kidding) game into an inch-long cartridge that doesn't even weigh 5 onces.
The graphics are great, pushing the GBA to the limits.  At first sight, I thought I was playing a Playstation game.  Well, I wasn't, but the graphics are pretty close to the PS.  The graphics easily rival the graphics of Final Fantasy IX, comparing the fact that both games push thier systems to the limit.  I give the graphics 5 out of 5 stars.
The SFX could use a little work, especially the water sounds.  The music, on the other hand, is terrific, showing the warmness of the towns, the calmness of the sea, the mystery of the lighthouses, and the terror of the dungeons.  The music alone could make you think you've beaten the game.  The SFX get a 4/5.
The music gets a 5/5.
The story is classic.  Someone steals something to try to bring evil to the land.  Very Zelda, and ultamatly, very Nintendo.  It has several fresh twists, such as actually trying to save a tree, rather than letting it die.  No, it's not a Deku tree, and yes, it can talk.  There are many Djinni that help you by releasing thier power to aid you.  Then you summon them!  Very Square Soft.  The main turning points, however, are kinda easy to foresee, and Garet's always trying to finish his quest and then claiming the idea of helping someone else was his gets kind of annoying.  The story gets a 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.
Overall, it is a great game and should be in your GBA library.  Expect to see more Golden Sun titles soon, like in spring.  Don't expect to beat it in a week, because, unless you play it for hours on hours on end, you won't beat it for a month or two, and if you beat it in a week, you need more hobbies.  Even I can't beat it that fast, and I play it all the time.

Cons: SFX needs work, no description for anime symbols, too long",positive

3380,"Many survival horror fans have gotten jaded. They think the genre is dying and in one review I heard someone saying Dead Space was RE 4 in space. While dead space has similar controls as RE 4 and even an over the shoulder 3rd person view point it is NOT remotely similar to RE 4 in atmosphere or level design.

For one thing,Issac is not a super elite mercenary. When the Ishumura planet resource harvester ship goes haywire Issac's job is to do some routine repairs. However there is a bit of worry right away when he receives an odd SOS from his main squeeze Nicole who is a medical officer aboard the space ship he is charged with fixing up. Luckily her message is so subtle and obscure it does not give away the whole story right away.

Along with Issac is a tough as nails take charge leader type and a female crew mate who is the shiznet at hacking and cracking. While these characters ""help"" Issac through a holographic communications screen with advice our poor protagonist ends up separated from his team and completely alone.

Dead Space is really good at telling you everything you need to know WITHOUT accessing a menu. Issac's health is measured by the glowing tubes down the spine of his armor and almost all information is relayed to him through a pop up screen device on his helmet he can manipulate at a whim. Likewise the crescent glowing icon on Issac's right shoulder gauges his ""stasis energy"" used to slow the opening and closing of malfunctioning doors. This makes Dead Space a more seamless experience and lulls you into a creepy train of thought of playing the game without always having the reminders it is a game.

Much like Bio Shock Issac comes to terminals where he can buy equipment such as ammo, health packs, and even new weapons. Each main ability or weapon is upgraded by circular disks called ""nodes"" you apply at fold out work benches. Nodes are rare, luckily they can be bought as well albeit at a high price. Issac even gets telekinesis. He can move things around and toss them similar to how Gordon Friedman does with the gravity gun in Half Life 2. Add all this atop of using gravity boots to mag lock onto walls and ceilings when in zero gravity it quickly becomes apparent Dead Space is not a tired retread or lackluster clone of Resident Evil. The only similarities it bears is that it is a hybrid between action thriller and survival horror. Luckily for those of us who love a good scare it is more terrifying and surreal than it is cheesy and over the top epic.

You can run and gun in dead space (further accentuating the differences between it and RE). As a matter of fact when hordes of necromorphs attack it is a good strategy to run backwards while firing away, or at least getting your bearings as you occasionally let fly with some sizzling plasma bolts.

So what are necromorphs? Apparently after busting apart a planet for resources the Ishumura away team found an odd artifact with ruins on it. Somehow this began mutating crew members into monsters. While that is not very original as a concept Necromorphs make ganados and zombies look tame by comparison. Even after having legs or an arm blown off these hideous freaks will still come after you and sometimes they may play dead after you hammer into them with a few rounds. As you confidently twirl your plasma torch and turn your back ""wham!"" you get a bone blade appendage through your kidney for not being thorough. I wasted a lot of ammo to make sure I decapitated every dead body or slain monster. Call me paranoid but hey, I rather be safe than sorry!

Each level has a series of mission objectives that range from refueling the Ishumura to recovering the captain's log. While these may seem a bit dull at least they make sense within a science fiction setting . In dead space you never have to find a ruby and an emerald then put them into the eye sockets of a gargoyle statue. Normally a puzzle requires using your telekinesis to move something or using a stasis shot to slow down a dangerous moving obstacle so you can past through into the next area.

While dead space is gory it does not just rely on blood n guts to frighten you. Even when you are not attacked by necromorphs the ship's metal haul creaks menacingly and the voices of the dead are heard whispering in select locations. You even pick up data pad diaries from Ishumura's crew  and as you can well imagine their last moments were filled with dread and hopelessness. Witnessing Issac having to wrestle for his dear life while locked in the clutches of a necromorph is not nearly as bone chilling as helplessly watching the person who seems safe behind a window get impaled and dragged into the shadows screaming or having to look at a nurse cackling insanely right before she fires up a bone saw and cuts her own throat. You wonder who you have to pity more...the grotesque creatures or those who were left unaltered as normal human beings?

If you approach all this from the optimistic perspective of an enthusiast instead of an embittered fan boy Dead Space is a wonderful horror game. As much as I covet RE 4 and RE 5 and herald them as awesome games they are ""thrillers"". Dead Space quintessentially is ""true dread"" pumped right into your veins. It's not toying with your emotions or trying to be something it is not.

I began playing it in the day time and it still got my heart pounding. For the foolish elitist bigots out there unshakable in their stance that ""western developers"" don't know diddly about true horror this game has arrived to bust their chops!

In closing if you have played these games for many years you're not going to jump from fright every 2 minutes. Once you become accustomed to scare tactics it can NEVER compare to the glory days when you were a virgin of the genre playing Silent Hill or RE 2 for the first time. However to me this game is so excellent at what it does it deserves some grudging respect from the survival horror community.

Pros

+Intriguing story

+Unrelenting terrifying enemies that give their all even after their limbs fly off.

+Atmospheric creepiness that balances out the blatant blood and gore

+Easy to learn controls

+Can run and shoot.

+Things such as anti gravity exploration and using telekinesis ""mix up"" the usual horror experience.

+No annoying menus to jolt you out of the fear. Every aspect of the game from your health to gathered information is all woven seamlessly into the technology of Issac's suit!

+Issac's ""weapons"" are actually tools to start with reminding us he is a mechanic and not a steroid popping space marine.

Con

-It's a space ship so some areas get to look very much the same after awhile.

-Reading text logs via Issac's holographic visor is near impossible. In my opinion everything should have been voiced.

-Enemies are varied at first but get repetitive later on.

Pro or con??

+/- Issac is a silent faceless protagonist very much akin to the hero in Bio Shock, Gordon Friedman in Half Life 2, and Master Chief in Halo. To some of you this maybe a problem however my take on it is as follows.

""Issac doesn't talk but it is the very fact he doesn't spout cheesy one liners or ridiculous catch phrases that makes his struggle that much more realistic, horrifying, and genuine.""

+/- There's alot of gore, perhaps moreso than any other game I've played. Sadly those that pride themselves on loving ""psychological horror"" are going to snub their noses at Dead Space a lot for that reason alone and in so doing miss out on the parts of it that are very surrealistic, thought provoking, and haunting.",negative

3392,"The Game Boy Advance (GBA) is the most powerful handheld gaming device on the market right now.  Not only will it play the newest, most advanced games available, but it's compatible with all the other kinds of Game Boy games as well!  You can even play original GB games in limited color and in a convienient streached mode that streaches the image to fill the large GBA screen.  With games like Mario Cart Super Circuit, Castlevania, Harry Potter, and Tetris Worlds, GBA spans all ages and prefrences of gamers.  Luckilly batteries last about 10 hours in this machine so you'll have lots of playing time.  When the batteries start to fade the power light turns from green to red, then slowly fades giving you plenty of warning so you don't loose any progress you've made.  There is even an adapter port that lets you attach an external light for playing in dimly lit areas (though it's best to play GBA under a lamp or in the sunshine).  It seems Nintendo has thought of everything!
The only drawbacks are that the control pad can be a bit too small for larger hands and the left and right shoulder buttons take some getting used to.  My hands cramped up a bit when I first strted playing, but after getting comfortable with the GBA these problems faded away.
Fuchsia GBA is the best color in my estimation becasue it's a harder color to find available.  Also it's so cute and yummy looking that you just want to lick it and see if tastes like candy!  I don't recomend doing that though!  No matter what color you decide on though, you're sure to be enjoying it for years to come!",positive

3395,"After releasing a rather lackluster sequel, Red Octane redeemed themselves (and just in time too as Rock Star is around the corner) and presented the long awaited third installment in the Guitar Hero series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Don't get me wrong, its not that Guitar Hero II was a complete flop, it just didn't feel as inspired as the original Guitar Hero; most of the songs were re-makes, and some of them were pretty lazy ones at that. I know quite a few Guitar Hero fans who were quite disappointed with the second installment, and I have to admit that Guitar Hero II had half the magic that Guitar Hero one had.

Well, there's a new Guitar Hero in town, and this one is bigger and better than the rest of 'em. Guitar Hero III boasts over 70 tracks including such hits as ""Bulls on Parade"" - by Rage Against the Machine, ""Black Magic Woman"" by Santana, ""When you were young"" by the Killers, ""Suck My Kiss"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""Pride and Joy"" by Stevie Ray Vaughn and many more. A much better set list makes Guitar Hero III easily the best iteration yet, but the greatness doesn't stop there.

Guitar Hero III introduces the much anticipated and long overdue online play. Go head to head against a stranger in the new Battle Mode, or team up with a fellow rocker in online co-op.  The great thing about it is that there is minimal wait times; there is almost always someone ready to play either in battle match or the co-op.

The online interface is simple yet effective; you have a choice between Ranked and Player matches (ranked matches track your stats while player matches are for fun). The Player matches consist of Face-Off, Pro-Face Off, Co-OP and Battle. while  Ranked has all but the Co-op.

You can do a search for the first available match or you can create your own match. The ""join a quick match"" makes match finding easy, but you can also be nit-picky if you choose and set filters (difficulty, number of songs, type of match, ranked or player) for the search.

Like Guitar Hero II, when you are in a mutliplayer match with either a physical buddy or an online one, you can choose whether you want to play Bass guitar or Lead Guitar (and sometimes you get to pick Rhythm Guitar), and like Guitar Hero II you can each select your own difficulty (this especially comes in handy if you happen face off against someone who is a master of the Expert difficulty.

The control and star power are exactly the same as the last Guitar Hero, but for battle mode Red Octane has devised a cool gimmick. Instead of star power during a multiplayer battle ( or a boss battle, yes you get to battle ""bosses"" at the end of certain stages, like Slash from Guns N Roses and Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine), you can earn power-ups that you can use against your foe. You can break their guitar strings, force them to use their whammy bar, up their difficulty, wreck their amplifier or block the view of their fretboard, making it near impossible to see the notes for a small period of time. You can also force them to play left-handed (this just reverses the button order).

I picked up Guitar Hero III on Saturday and I have been playing it non-stop. Tracks like ""One"" by Metallica and ""Striken"" by Disturbed are strangely addicting; I've played through medium, most of hard and the beginning of Expert. Online competitive play encourages me to keep my practice up and gives me more than enough reasons to keep hoisting your trusty old axe atop your shoulders for ""one more go"". Oh, and there are achievements galore, and they are HARD! Some of the achievements are standard fare (score this many points, or beat this difficulty), but others are darn complicated; one achievement requires you to beat ""Through the Fire and Flames"" by Dragonforce on Expert. For those of you who do not know this song, it is probably one of the most complex and THE most fastest guitar shredding song in the world. There are over 1500 notes in that song alone, and they whiz by in a flurry of blinding speed.

Like the other Guitar Hero's before it, III has a store where you can upgrade your guitars, buy new guitars, buy new characters, songs, videos and a download link to Xbox Live (no downloadable content yet, but there will be soon).

My only gripe with this game is the over saturation of in-game advertising; familiar brand names and logos litter the environments. Lets see, Pontiac, Red Bull, Zabian, Guitar Center and Axe body spray, just to name a few. I guess its not all bad though, because most of the songs on Guitar Hero III are the actual song and not a re-make. I have a feeling that the in-game advertising and the profits from Guitar Hero I and II helped with that.

If you enjoy rhythm games, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You will LOVE it, not to mention how fun it is to rock out to some really great tunes.",neutral

3399,"This is one of my favorite Real Time Strategy video games. It was designed to be fluid and optimized for playing on a console as opposed to a mouse and keyboard.

3405,"ok so i am not a fan of PC games. i have only played a few, but i have wanted to play this game forever now, i love rts games and this is the best i have played. this game is a mix of CAC and civilization, i say this because it has real time combat and turn based strategy, and the real time looks just like civilization.. the turn based part is hard to learn as there is really no help to be given, but the battle part is easy to understand. you can also battle by ships and ground. this game is my favorite pc game EVER. RTS fans here is the best game ever. but that is not to say that only RTS fans will love it. i for one LOVE call of duty, battlefield, halo, and those type of games but this game is still super fun!!!! i think i have found my 2nd love here people. and it is SUPER CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive

3407,This is a great keyboard. One of the reasons I had picked this keyboard was that it had no pit underneath the keys for dust and dirt to collect. This makes the keyboard quite easy to clean. Unfortunately the silver color does mean that dirt will stand out easier (and the LEDs reflect off the silver aluminum which can be annoying at first). The keyboard is heavy; and can be somewhat noisy if you have not used a mechanical keyboard before. I do find it quite pleasurable to type on.,negative

3409,"I commute an hour to and from work every day by train. I don't have time to play my PS2 anymore... now I can take it with me! The PSP has everything I could ever want in a portable entertainment device! It's a gaming unit, MP3 player, movie player, picture viewer and now with software update 2.0, wireless web browser and much more! The PSP is still a baby. There is so much potential I can see with future software releases like global GPS which Sony has already announced. As for the games, there is a whole new crop of games due out this fall and if it's any indication by the PS2, there will be many many more to come.

The only minus I see is the need purchase for an additional 1GIG stick. The 32MG that sony provides is just useless. Firewire instead of USB port would also have been nice. The MP3 player is very basic, though Sony can change that with future software releases. The UMD disks are OK but a bit slow on the loading. The games too are also a bit pricey but I can see that leveling off in due time. I recomend for an extra 20 bucks going out and buying a screen protector and a rubber skin for the PSP that Pelican makes (similar to the ipod one). Other then these minor gripes, I love my PSP, wouldnt trade it for anything!",neutral

3412,"I heard about this game on a website and thought I would check it out.  It is loosely based on the George Lucas movie of the same name but had little to do with the movie except for the characters.  Being a Capcom game, you can expect great graphics, great music (the overworld theme gets stuck in your head), great control, and great fun.  It is an action RPG which means you directly attack the enemies and gain experience to boost your level.  There is no money system in this game so you have to find all of the items (much like Illusion of Gaia) although there is different magic you can learn, and weapon and armor upgrades.  The enemy AI is not very good but makes for a pleasant experience.  There are small cut scenes when Willow talks to people that are nicely done.  Although not a long game, you will enjoy every minute of it.  If you are a fan of the Zelda series or Mana series, I would suggest that you play this hidden gem and see that games based on movies can be great!",positive
3413,"A lot of people have been trashing on this game, but It's really quite a lot of fun. It's been pulling me away from Fallout 4 pretty often as my most played game at the moment. I've been enjoying it so much I purchased an extra code for a friend as an Xmas gift.

There is definitely a ton of room for new content, but the good news is that if you're looking at this bundle it will all be included. Much like Battlefield, you're going to want the season pass and this bundle includes it.

Keep in mind that you're paying $10 for some early unlocks, the season pass is $50. I was able to get $12 off using a Cyber Monday code so this became the most attractive option.",positive

3417,"If you're looking for epic battles of 25 Orcs versus one powerful Ranger with Wraith powers, with brutal, merciless combat in an open world game (including 2 maps, Mordor Wasteland and Mordor Grass Cliffs), then look no further than the exceptionally fun Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. The game shines on PS4, with incredible detail to the main character and Uruk Kai Orcs.

Game play includes riding Graug giants and Caragor dogs. Lots of incredible fighting abilities to unlock for archery, swordfighting and stealth attacks. Time of day set at will and you can set your own checkpoints in the large, open maps. Unlock the 2nd map after completing the main missions in the first map.

Great game and hopefully there is a sequel with a combined open world and more enemy types aside from the great variety of Orcs here. Nazgul Wraiths, Wargs, wolves, giant spiders, etc.",positive

3431,"I had heard that the 4th installment in the Monkey Island series was not that great. However, I think that it was just as fun and hilarious as the previous games. I hope that they remake it (Just like they did the first two) someday. I would purchase it then as well because sometimes it is difficult to get old games working. It was easy to get this game working because there is a third party installer for Windows 7 available for download on the internet from ""Quick and Easy Install"". It also worked for me on Windows 8. You can just search for ""Escape from Monkey Island Installer"" on Google and it is usually the first page that comes up in the search. (Or you could just search for Quick and Easy Install and their page will come up as well) Oh, and the third party installer is free! (They will ask for donations if you want to though). So if you are having trouble installing this game on Windows 7 or 8, you should check it out. I highly recommend this game to any Monkey Island Fans.",positive

I threw it away and won't ever buy anything but the  authentic Sony 6 axis controller ever again even tho it is really tough to find them for under $45. They r well worth it. I've tried several off brands and they r all in the garbage. Do not waste your time and money on generic if u r a serious gamer or a parent buying for a kid because your kid will b in tears as the generic controller especially for shooters is terrible and you absolutely cannot b precise.

3446,"The wait for many games was long. And the price point for this system at launch was ridiculous. I don't think a lot of gamers were in their right minds when they bought this on March 27th for 250 U.S. bucks just to play Pilot Wings, a fighting game that was already on two of this gen's home consoles and many other games that lacked a spark. Some people just need new gadgets right away just 'cause they are new. The more patient (and I say smart) people will wait. And they did. For more updates and more games. By the time Christmas rolled around there were three new colors, more game options, a fantastic price drop of 80 bucks and plenty of updates to now make the system a steal. I asked for the system for Christmas and have not been letdown since I opened the packaging.

The show stealer and much talked about feature of this system is obviously the 3D (without the need for special glasses). I've tried it with Super Mario 3D Land and it works well. It helps you judge the distance of platforms and such. Rayman 3D's use of this feature is also well implemented (even more so than Mario is in my opinion). Well maybe that's not a fair statement...Mario Land's 3D is used in a few more different ways but Rayman's 3D really seems to ""pop"" more. But remember: 1. Some people can't see 3D at all no matter how they try. And 2. No one under the age of 7 should be viewing the the top screen on the 3DS while the system's 3D bar is elevated to any level. It could damage their young, still developing eyes so keep it ""OFF""/on the lowest possible level when they are watching or playing.

The 3DS is capable of a myriad of things though, 3D just being one of them. There is an internet browser, a sound app, a camera app, a Mii Making app, an e-Shop, a Daily Log app, Face Raiders, AR games and many more that the original DS and DS Lite just didn't have. One of my favorite things about this video game system is the e-Shop. Enabling us to scroll through tons of stuff and view video games, videos and such as well as purchase content is amazing. I've only purchased the DSi game ""Magical Whip"" and ""The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX"" so far but I can tell I will be using the e-Shop for quite a bit, especially for watching videos of upcoming games and writing reviews on titles I've played.

This is a good time to purchase the 3DS. With the game library only growing, the color lineup getting more and more robust and the promising system updates we've already seen, Nintendo is on a high. The system looks and feels pretty great. There are a few setbacks such as the two screens rubbing together when the 3DS is closed, and it leaving some temporary marks on the top screen. Or the fact that not all the games that people want to see are out yet.

While the latter can still be seen as a minor problem, I commend Nintendo for trying their darndest in giving us quality games without rushing too much. Long live Nintendo!

3448,"As stated over 1,000 times before mii, the Wii is a great system for hardcore gamers, those who've been playing games for a long time, or casual gamers, those who are either new to videogames or play ""everybody can play"" games. While Wii may not offer state of the art HD visuals, it more than makes up for that with its intuitive gameplay and artistic graphics. In Wii Sports, if you want to hit a baseball with a bat, you swing the Wiimote just as you'd  a real bat, etc... the list goes on. With casual games like Wii Fit, Wii Music, and Wii Sports, those who consider themselves casual will not be disappointed. Contrary to popular belief, between games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Smash Bros: Brawl, and Guitar Hero: World Tour, Metroid Prime 3, Call of Duty: World at War, Mario Galaxy and countless VC and WiiWare titles such as Mega Man 9, Wii isn't lacking in hardcore titles, either.
  So in short, if you'e been a fan of videogames all your life or are new to the scene, the Wii will NOT disapoint. Act quick, because the Wii happens to be quite a difficult item to reach these days.",negative

Quite a lot of games are significantly easier to play with this controller, including Watch_Dogs, Just Cause 2, and Super Meat Boy.

The only possible complaint is the same that others have had, and that's that the trigger buttons are a little bit on the stiff side. However, for the cost and overall performance, it doesn't bother me that much.",positive

3451,"Lets get this out of the way right now. The Order is NOT a long game. By long I mean its not 40+ hours. Hell its not even 20 hours. What it is, is about 10 to 12 hours (depending on play-style) of storytelling mixed with gameplay. Once the action beats start they are plentiful and well orchestrated. On the story front we have nice story-line. Good, strong characters. Interesting mythos and (I feel) a great place to start a new IP.
Is it perfect? Well, that's a matter of opinion but there are no parts of this game that make it unplayable.

The decisions Ready at Dawn made in which cinematics and gameplay are seamless have split the gaming community. Some don't mind, some think more shooting less talking, some feel it should be somewhere in-between.

I believe that the blend is just right. I was satisfied with the game and the time I spent with it. Would I have paid premium for the privilege? No, since there is no replay value in the product. There are no skill trees, no MP, no horde mode, not even a new game plus.
That, in my opinion is this games worst offense. Not giving the player incentive to come back for more. So, why the 5 star rating then? I feel the entire package, taken as whole warrants this.

Get the game at a good price and indulge, it is an experience that should not be missed, especially for older gamers that can appreciate a good yarn tossed in with beautiful graphics.",positive

I love the combat. It's kinda fast paced. I like it that way. The graphics are fabulous. Especially when you play in 720p, which I'm sure all of you play in. There are lots of characters, plus the unlockables. The character creation is great. You have lots of freedom. The online is great. It's like a tournament.

3460,"God of War I and II on the PlayStation 2 were easily the best two games on that console, which is saying something considering that the PS2 had some truly remarkable games.  With the hotly-anticipated God of War III coming out on PlayStation 3 next year, Sony felt that those who've never played the first two games would be missing out.  Enter God of War Collection, which is a brilliantly remastered package containing the first two games in the series.  And what a package it is!

The two games have been remastered in 720p high-definition, 2x anti-aliasing and upgraded to a smooth-as-silk 60 frames per second.  The result is striking.  I certainly did not expect the difference to be that noticeable, but I was awestruck when the first level began.  The game looks crystal clear (and if you've played PS2 games on an HDTV, you'll know how blurry they look!).  The game moves EXTREMELY smoothly, and the screen tearing that plagued the games on PS2 are completely gone.  This game looks and plays immaculately, and could almost pass for a current-generation game.  The content of the games are identical, so there are no extras beyond what was included in the PS2 releases (and yes, the content on the bonus DVD that was packaged in God of War II is here as well).  Also included is a voucher for the God of War III demo, which is definitely something to behold.

If you've never played these games before, you simply need to get this game right now.  It's one of the best gaming experiences you'll ever have.  Santa Monica Studios created a game that is downright flawless in execution.  The hack and slash elements are kept fresh, and never feel like ""button mashing"".  The play control is perfect.  I can assure you that you will never ever feel like the controls get in the way.  They're responsive and precise, and you'll be amazed at how easy it is to control Kratos through various situations.  The puzzles are just amazing and the level design is atmospheric and perfectly crafted.  Not to mention, these games have one of the best soundtracks ever.  The storyline is very original, and never feels contrived.  This is storytelling at its greatest.

One minor gripe, the pre-rendered cutscenes are still in standard-definition, so it's a notable drop in quality, but it doesn't break the game in any way, and it's much less noticeable in God of War II.

PlayStation 3 owners that have never played these games before need to try it out.  Plain and simple.  And if you have played them before, you will have a great time playing them again in HD.  For $40, this should be a no-brainer.",positive

The story is good and battlelog makes it easy to connect with your friends to a server.",positive

3466,"AC4 is not perfect, but I feel it's the best entry in the series since Ezio in AC2.1/Brotherhood.  It seems Ubisoft is launching a new pirate-based trilogy starring Edward Kenway.  Connor from AC3 seems to simply be a jumping off point for the new trilogy much as Atair was the jumping off point for the Ezio trilogy.

AC4 also presents a new opportunity for Ubisoft in that it's a game that newcomers won't feel lost jumping into.  You don't need to play the previous 5 or 6 games in order to enjoy this one.  It's a pirate game at its base with strong assassin elements.  It makes for a very compelling experience that's sure to have broad appeal for action fans.

The game is incredibly rich.  There is land based gameplay that features the hide-in-plain-sight stealth and climb-nearly-anything elements that are core to the series.  There's incredibly well-developed sea based gameplay that features ship battles and boarding parties.  There's a rewarding upgrade system.  There's even a fleet mini game that helps you earn big heaps of cash.  And that's hardly an exhaustive list.

The ship based portion of the game is even more developed from AC3.  The seas themselves behave wonderfully and the ship sails over them very satisfyingly.  My favorite thing to do is to attack one of the forts.  You assail the fort with your ship and when the fort is pacified, you land your ship and move on to secure the fort through combat.  It's very fun, but once the fort is secure, you never have to secure it again.  There are only 8 or so forts on the map.

One other great new feature is the ability to fast travel to any discovered location or view point on the massive map.

The combat, sadly enough, is one aspect of the game that seems to be a step back.  Edward uses any combination of 2 swords, up to 4 pistols and of course the double hidden blade.  There's no longer a knife like previous entries in the series.  It all works really well for the most part, but ultimately seems to lack the variation of kill animations that appeared in previous games.  Ezio and Connor were better fighters.

Edward is also not much of a climber.  I think the climbing mechanic peaked with Connor in AC3 with his ability to climb buildings, trees and rock faces.  Edward is pretty much limited to buildings and trees to a lesser extent.  Rock faces are only climbable if there is a building embedded in the rock to support it.

Edward's character is certainly a lot more interesting than Connor with the potential to rival even Ezio.  However, you don't grow as much with Edward as you did with Ezio (the series followed Ezio from a young boy to an old man).  Any of Edward's history is shown through unplayable flashbacks.

The meta narrative I think is far improved in this game too.  There's even some good comedy to be found in those sections.

In the end, I put more than 50 hours into this game and probably came within 70% of completion.  Like I said, it's a rich game.  Ubisoft also now includes some amount of social interaction with the ability to rate missions, which I think is great.  It means that future games will feature more of the fun missions and less of the tedious ones.  I enjoyed this game greatly.  It's an easy recommendation.",positive

3473,"I cannot believe this game has an average rating of 4 stars on amazon, this is as close to perfection as a football sim will ever get.  Anyone who thinks FIFA is better than this is frankly an idiot, all it has over Winning Eleven (Pro Evolution Soccer in the UK) is full licensing of world teams and leagues.  I believe that in the US EA's John Madden games have got a monopoly on the official license, and this is how EA rely on shifting units.  The gameplay on FIFA is absolute garbage, anyone who knows anything about football or video games will tell you this, Winning Eleven plays the game exactly how it should be played.

The other criticism i've seen on here is people saying it's too hard, well with all due respect you obviously aren't that good at it then.  I consider myself an expert at the game and recently won the master league on 6 stars winning 27 of 30 league games and completing the treble as well.  The game has a steep learning curve because it rewards skill, unlike FIFA where a complete novice can pick it up and beat someone who owns the game.  If you insist on full licensing and and simple and basic computer AI that is easy to beat then you shouldn't own this game anyway, this is strictly for the football purist and believe me it pis*es all over that heap of sh*t FIFA.  I will continue my plea to Konami however to try harder to get better licensing next year, if they do than this will wipe the floor sales wise with FIFA.",positive
3474,"This is the most fun racing game combined with the power ups and character specific story lines from FF. I've played CTR, yes it's a lot of fun. But for almost all ages of kids and level of difficulty being appropriate for them, and tons of fun for parents or older kids to play all together - the best racing game ever. Great Turismo while amazing and super cool is too difficult and technical for some people. CTR I really like too, but sometimes those tracks are pretty challenging (read: frustrating) for newer racers, of any age and some of the racers are unequal to the""best"" characters, Crash.

Definitely go with Chocobo Racing for a complete game, that's fun and challenging for all ages, all skills and also themes the best game series ever in its category.",positive
3475,"No, not from Zelda, the new link cable from Nintendo designed especially for the GameBoy Advance is something you want if you like the head-to-head-to-head-to-head action. WOW! Four people can be linked up on special games for a multiplayer challenge. On some games, this even opens new events that otherwise can't be gotten in normal gameplay. You don't even need the same game-console ratio, because just one game pak provides enough fun for four people. Definitely worth the price. To link 2 consoles, you need 1 cable, with 3, you need 2 cables, and with 4, you need 3 cables.",positive
3476,"I needed a grip for my Vita because play sessions of any length were giving me the worst hand cramps. The Nyko grip isn't the beefiest controller I've held, but it's a solid, stable grip that has eased my hand woes. The extra battery is nice too! Easy to clip on, solid to hold, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes to dig in and play for a long time.",positive

3478,"Golden Sun is an excellently made classical RPG that has some neat innovations, but is really only one half of a whole. Whats neat are the abilities characters use outside of combat to solve some decently complex puzzles. You get an ability to read peoples minds in order to gather clues or learn what NPCs are actually thinking, you can make a pillar of ice form from a puddle of water, or move, grab and lift objects for traversal, and if you see a little plant sprouting out of the ground, you can make it grow to climb it. When combined together in a dungeon, solutions will sometimes be obvious and sometimes not. There's a level of cleverness that I appreciated. I also like the Dijnn system of discovering unique equipable creatures along your journey. Depending on who equips which Dijnn, you can change the class of your characters, giving them improved stats or new spells. The story starts strong but can be a little confusing. Youll more or less understand the basics of whats happening, even if you don't necessarily understand why it's happening or what the motivation is. The longer the game goes, the more invested you'll become, and before you know it (about 30 hrs in) youll be boarding a ship ready to hit the open seas, anticipating what awaits next, when the credits abruptly start to roll. I was more than a little surprised by the cliffhanger the game ends on. My guess is that by playing through the second game, Golden Sun: The Lost Age, the story will come into complete focus and the overall experience will be greater than each half by itself. Taken only in the context of the first game, however, it feels slightly disappointing, with it ending just when it should be taking off.

3481,"What used to be an arcade game now available on the Wii U, and it is oh-so-good.  If you ever played games like Dragonball Xenoverse and Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (try saying that three times really fast), then you know how this game goes.  Unlike Dragonball Xenoverse though, all fights are one on one, can't say much for Naruto S.U.N.S. 4 since I haven't played it but might be the same principle.  This was one game that looked interesting just from the concept alone.  Imagine a Poke'mon game where you actually fight other Poke'mon, instead of just giving them a command.  Even though this is just my early impressions, I feel like these are impressions that could last.

First of all, this is one game I will NOT buy pre-owned.  Why?  Because it includes an Amiibo card of Shadow Mewtwo.  This allows you to unlock Shadow Mewtwo until you quit the game, which after you do, you have to rescan the card again.  Nintendo must really want people to use these things for that to happen.  Speaking of Shadow Mewtwo, I like the roster of Poke'mon they have.  You got Poke'mon like Charizard, Gardevoir, Gengar, Pikachu (of course you have to have him in a Poke'mon game), and Lucario, etc.  One Poke'mon I thought was a wierd choice was Chandelure, mostly because it seems like you'll be fighting a floating chanilier that spits out fire, but there seems to be a solid roster in the game.

For gameplay, it's something I like to call a free-roam fighter but switches from Arena to Duel Mode, and vice versa.  In Arena Mode, the arena is basically this circular area that you can move about in, but you can also change the perspective into Duel Mode, which changes it to more of a 2D fighter.  While this might sound a bit difficult to pull off, it's actually as easy as pulling off a combination, and where this mode differs from Field Mode is that you have a crouch and an upper position, which lets you pull off moves exclusive to those modes.  As far as attacks, it runs in what the game calls ""a fancy version of rock/paper/scissors,"" which is a perfect was to describe it.  Normal attacks trumps grabs, grabs trumps counters, and counters (if you haven't got the picture yet) trumps normal attacks.  This is a HUGE thing to remember.  You also have Support Poke'mon that, when used at the right time, they can help you by attacking the other Poke'mon, giving them a negative effect on stats, which are the ones I would recommend using, or give you a positive effect, such as faster speed and stronger attacks.  You can also pull of a powerful attack, a Synergy Burst, by pressing both the L and R buttons, of course you have to be in Synergy Mode.  This allows the game to be easy to pick up and play, but I'm sure, like other fighting games, it will be tough to master without the patience.

The controls also work pretty well, but this is one of those games where I would've thrown the gamepad controller to the side.  I think the Pro Controller would be more suited for the game, since that isn't a massive controller.  However, if you play Local Multiplayer (which I'm surprised it's still a thing), someone has to use the gamepad controller.  Also, while the game itself runs great, it takes a massive dip in local multiplayer, and this isn't the only game that does that.  Even Splatton, another Wii U exclusive, does it.  Now, I think this is because while one player looks at the TV, the other plays on the gamepad, thus requiring more power to stream the game to the gamepad, but hey, at least it's a more ""cinematic experience.""  This would be one thing Nintendo can fix with their next system, but at least it is included, and there's a range of controllers to use, such as the Pro Controller, Wii Classic Controller, and even the Wiimote with Nunchuck, which is one I didn't even expect.

Graphics-wise, it looks good for a Wii U game.  It also, looking past local multiplayer, runs well at a smooth 60 frames per second.  Of course, most Wii U games do that, so it shouldn't be a surprise for most.  There are also some details added to the character models, such as fur details on Lucario, haze on Gengar, and a bit shine on things like the icicles on Suicune's head.  The Wii U might not be the most powerful console their is, but the style their games have can make it like closer like the next gen consoles, even if it's not that close.

The sounds are also great.  Even though I haven't had time to listen to the music, the hits are satisfying, to say the least.  I do feel like whatever human voice acting there is (*cough* Nia *cough*), it can sound a bit wooden.  Nia also provides hints during fights, which comes to one thing I will give the Poke'mon Company, that you leave it as is, set it to just a few hints, or just shut her up for good if you find her that annoying.  Frankly, I have no problem with Nia since I'm too focused on the fight, but she will tell you when your Synergy or Support bar is full, so at least she is kinda useful.

Overall, this has been a good game so far.  I will probably update this review if anything comes up, but I doubt the game has any major glitches, if any at all.  This is one of those games I truly can recommend, even for those not lucky enough to play the arcade game, which is a lot.",positive
3482,"Game was pretty fun especially since i have never really played a super smash bros game yet til now.  The game features many of the past characters from the previous titles and new comers(villager from animal crossing, wii fit trainer, etc.).  Online mode is pretty fun, but the fights can extremely lag if you don't have the decent wifi (I use cox high speed internet and it works pretty well with almost no lag).  The game has multiple styles of minigames and actual one on one fights so theres really high replay value.  Lastly the game doesn't include an actual story like its predecesor super smash bros brawl.  While the game doesn't have a story line the gamplay in itself makes up for it and more.",positive

3489,"Are you looking for a good christmas gift for your chldren grandchildren? Look no further than the sims. In the Sims you start off by creating a family of one to eight members. Then you must build or by a house with the limmited money you have. The characters must then buy the needed applainces for your family (or just cool unneededthings.) with money you get from work. Actually there are no uneeded applainces. For instance a basketball net may sem like an unneeded item however, what if your job is a pro athlete you will need this item to get promoted. You also must be happy to get promoted in any job so items like a tv can help. You don't need to have only one family, you can build about 8. (and more with the expansion.) You can even control what the characters do and get married and have kids. However, I wouldn't recomend this game to children under 8 because it deals with some Mature themes like sex and nudity, but these scenes are never very graphic and also edited.

Normally I do all my gaming on PC but decided to take a break and check out an rpg for ps3, and this one totally took me off guard.
Right from the start, gameplay and combat was smooth and easy to get into, but somewhere around chapter 3 something started to happen...I finally started watching all the cutscenes then got all interested in the plot and the characters...Anyway after restarting and really paying attention from the getgo, I found the concept of making a game based around the condition of Chopin in his final hours was really weird (in a good way) and educational...and the graphics are really nice. Since this my first rpg for the ps3, and since I'm going for the second playthrough, I would highly recommend this game",positive

Pick it up and get pumped for the new one this August 2017.,positive
3496,"When the original Silent Hill was released for the PSX, critics and gamers alike dismissed it as yet another ""mindless"" Resident Evil clone. (The why RE was not dismissed as an Alone in the Dark clone is beyond me) Needless to say the game went by underrated. For the ones of use who were lucky enough to play it before it was given any publicity, Silent Hill offered an intoxicating alternative to the cheap ""experiment-gone-wrong"" formula of the RE games. Its mixture of dark spiritual terror and arcane metaphysics was more than enough to give a few people enough nightmares to wonder about the intensity of the game and go on a joy ride trying to figure out the obscure and convoluted plot.
Silent Hill 2 is more of the same, only that the formula is being used on the inverse. There are not too many jumps ""to the other side"", and the few ones that there are aren't as rusted and blood filled as in the previous game. Instead, we are greeted with darkened streets covered in sheets, all in an aura of silence and mystery. This has been the complain of some gamers of the first title, but for some gamers (myself included) this did more to the series than before. This time we are assured that the danger does not lay in a blood spilled hallway; it is there, in an ordinary darkened street.
The story is set in a different area of the same town and has no relationship with the previous game. It tells the story of James Sunderland, a man chattered by the tragic death of his wife three years ago, but when he receives a letter by his wife summoning him to their ""special place"" in Silent Hill he is set to find out the truth behind this letter and behind himself.
The story line is filled with the typical cryptic icons of Japanese pop-culture; psychedelic sequences, gore and violence, symbolism, a good dose of moral philosophy, a complex plot, mysticism, occultism, etc. The game centers more upon the dark side of the human mind, instead of devil worshiping, (like in the original SH) giving the game a darker feel than the previous chapter. The enemies are modeled after truly bizarre creatures; some of them, like the nurses, although not of a terrifying nature are capable of making you jump out of your skin by the tortuous screams those faceless heads spit out of somewhere. Others, like the infamous Pyramid Heads will hunt your waking hours. The two sexual-like sequences early during the game are of the most disturbing things I have seen in recent next-gen video gaming.
This game is really worth the buy. Do not expect a diabolical ride like the previous game; this game is a ride to the darkest reaches of the Soul.",negative
3497,"I tried using 3 other grips, all with varying degrees of effectiveness and comfort. The problem with the way this item is advertised, is that they lean towards it being more for protection than a grip. It is actually the most comfortable grip on the market. If you have ever held a Nerf football, it feels exactly like that.

The grips are in the perfect position for gameplay longevity. Making holding the Vita, more like holding a Xbox 360 or PS3 controller. I cant express enough how good this feels to the fingertips. Id imagine that this would offer a decent amount of protection to the back of the unit, if dropped... but I wouldnt recommend dropping the unit from very far, as ultimately this is still made of plastic. with about a quarter inch of Nerf material surrounding he entire back of the grip. It is held on by plastic snaps on the side and will not come off easily, which is a good thing.

The back has a plastic pop-off protector for the back screen... which also houses a 3 game case, for those on the go.

This offers no protection for the front of the unit, which I recommend buying the Cosmos 3 Pack Crystal Clear Front & Back Screen Protector for. I am experimenting with thin silicone cases, to see if I can find one that fits the Vita... and also fits in the Nerf grip.

Overall, there isn't a better, more comfortable feeling grip on the market. It should never slip out of your hands, even if they are wet. It offers comfort that all of the other grips Ive tried, couldn't provide.

I cannot recommend it enough. Everyone with a Vita, should have one.",neutral

Eruptor is a fire element, has some really cool powers. He 'erupts' lava and throws lava lobs (fire balls). He's one of he slower Skylander characters but makes up for it with his strength.

Not one tear, etc and we have had the skin for months. It is softer on our feet and buns than I could have imagined so workouts are easier and we find ourselves doing more.

3527,"If you own a PSP but not this game, buy this game.  Especially at the price its being offered now.

I am not good at dual-stick shooters, and this is a variation on the theme using the right X,O,[],^ buttons to look/aim.  It took me a while to get used to this, but the tutorial missions and campaign mode ramp up the difficulty very well, throwing a little at a time.

I died often during the boss battles of the first couple missions, but playing them again after completing the entire campaign, I can easily go through without dying on hard mode.  I've gotten used to the shooting, the gadgets, and some techniques for clearing a room.

This is my first Syphon Filter game, so Gabe Logan is a new character to me, and once I got used to the gruff ""I'm Batman"" voice, I found the voice acting pretty good, lots of FMV to tell the story.  Some of the movies are a little long, but not punishingly so like MGS:PW.

The campaign is around 30 missions, each taking me 7-20 minutes to complete, a very good pace to keep the action and the story moving.  Now that I'm done, I'm replaying the missions trying to improve my Career Rating.  When you progress through your rating, you unlock new weapons, which are nice, but I may not use them, I just like the act of trying the same mission using different weapons/techniques.  For example, try the mission killing the enemies with only a knife, or by only using headshots, or using the environment.  Replaying the missions this way is a blast (literally, sometimes) and I'll probably log twice as much time doing this as I did during the story.

The audio is great, when playing with headphones, you can hear baddies coming in through the squeaky door, then walking around the corner.  The soundtrack is appropriate with excellent action cues.  Its too bad you hear the UMD spooling up before the song plays though, it spoils a bit of the suspense.

All in all, I knew this game was highly-rated before I bought it, but wasn't sure if I could overcome the controls.  I shouldn't be surprised that I liked it so much, but I am.  Buy it now!",negative

3532,"I rarely review Games - mainly because I'm just a casual player who likes to play now and again and I'm not really up on all of the lingo or high tech stuff.  But after getting my laptop and realizing that Baldur's Gate 2 won't play correctly on Windows Vista (at least for me) I was devistated.  I have played and replayed that game countless times and always enjoyed it.

So then my darling husband gave me this for Christmas (PS3 version) and not only am I addicted - but my husband (who generally only plays games that involve little story and high body counts) is now fighting me for time to play it.

What do I love?  First of all the story - true D&D style save the world, do major quests, be good or not-so-good, find treasure, fight dragons, talk to all of the people in the town - those types of games just suck me in.  The story is a lot of fun if you can get past the fact that most fantasy tales are pretty much the same - an unlikely hero gets thrown in with a band of other unlikely heros and they save the world from some dark force.  The music is fantastic, the graphics are ""Good enough"" and my favorite part - the characters who join you.  I LOVE them.

Because I'm a fast reader - I have always been irritated by games that had VO rather then text dialog, mainly because I read much faster then the person speaking and I want to take the coversations at my speed.  This is only the second game where the VO didn't bother me because the VO actors did such a stellar job (the other game was FF12).  This game also meets my requirement of - if my stepson is bleeding can I just set down the controller and apply the bandaid without my character dying or requiring a save point.

As far as difficulty - I'm playing my first run through on ""Normal"" and though it says I have 60 hours playing time I would guess I'm closer to 30 because I have been leaving the game on at night.  It says I have explored 50% of the world so far and I think I have about half of the armies set up to join me in the battle... the fights have been hard but not impossible for me.  As a casual gamer I often lose interest in a game if I encounter something that is too difficult, that has yet to happen.  And with so many options about what to make my character do, if I have run into a section that is too hard, I just head off to another section until I'm a bit stronger.

I love most of my party members (I think I have all but one so far, including the free DL character ""Shale"") and I find myself going back to camp over and over just to talk to them.  Also their random bantering while we're out exploring often borders on hilarious.  Especially if you have party members who don't particularly get along.

As to the romances - and yes there are inter-party romances that include smooching and possibly taking a party member back to your tent for a little nookie, they are actually quite fun to participate in if you are into the role playing aspect of D&D games.  Is there nudity - not in the romance part (at least not so far and I've had a few people back to my tent) but some of the creatures you fight appear to be topless so if you have little ones then that's something to keep in mind.

This game is NOT appropriate for young children - and I'm not just talking about the romance aspect.  The themes in this game are often dark, and choices that you make and act out can be morally ambiguous.  There are also themes of genocide, assassination, murder, cheating, women and children being killed etc.  On top of that, the dialogue is very mature - though the F bomb is never dropped, there are conversations about the characters pasts that include discussions of brothels, rape, assassination, views both for and against the church of the land... lots of things to make a parent wince if their little one is in the room.  I have had to battle to keep my 8 year old away because he just sees me fighting monsters - but it's the themes that make this an adult game.

Also being an open minded individual - I am very proud of Bioware for introducing same sex romances - there is one option for a male/male and one for a female/female.  Very rarely do you see that in a game.  Don't worry if that kind of thing terrifies you - you have to go looking for it.

Are there any negatives?  Well of course there are - there are a few of the voice actors who I could not understand (The Werewolves for one) also I could have really used a little more info on the spells and talents that my characters have - a little advisement perhaps like - ""This spell does this and affects this many monsters/allies.""  And perhaps an item list like - ""this garnet stone serves no purpose other then to sell for money"" - so I'm not carrying useless things around hoping they have a purpose.

On the whole I will probably still be playing this game 2-3 years from now so that I can complete all of the origin stories and try to get all of the endings - for the amount of game play involved this is well worth the money.",negative

3534,"One of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've enjoyed. Great story, challenging game play.",negative
3535,"Got these for my brother and my brother is definitely not easy to please. he wouldnt be using these if they didn't work well and he uses them daily. They seem to be holding up great as well, a good buy from a quality seller. Would buy again.",positive
3536,"I got this game a few days ago and had never ever played the first(just wanted the 1st one).  This game is great since you can slowly do things wiothout taking up most of your day, do a little here, a little there.  So here's my look on the game.

First of all, this could be played by anyone above the age of 7(of course any age if your risking them having a DS).  Even though young kids can play this, adults enjoy this too.

You basically start out with nothing, come up with the your name, town name, male/female... etc  You finally get to the city and work for Nook for a while(i guess like the 1st one?).  Once you finish you can do whatever.  <-Best part!

I love the multiplayer here!  I play with my bro on it all the time.  All you do is one open the gate and the other(s) go visit you.  They can't do certain things while at your town(ie Donate, pay morgage) but any basics things can still be done.  I have not tried this out online because you have to know someone and have their friend code.  With so much hassle of the Wifi stuff, might be easier to go to the friend's house since you can't play with anyone other than friends.

Well this game has made me play it several hours a day since I got it, so i bet most people will enjoy this.  If you are thinking of a game to get for someone for Crhistmas, get this game or Mario Kart DS.  Both are great and addicting games.",negative

3550,"I've been playing tomb raider games since they first came out, in those pyramid shaped boxes for the computer you remember it don't you? It was in the windows 95 era.  I know it's been up and down for the series over the years, usually down.  However I keep on buying them, and this time I wasn't disappointed.  I like this game a lot.  It's the same old thing, Not in a bad way, but well,  you know how it goes. Explore the tomb/dungeon  etc theme. The game comes also with a nice plot that connects well with the other TR legends game.  Very nice really.  The graphics and sound are top notch next-gen material as you might expect.  There are some actually amazing moments in there.  The gameplay is also fun and addictive and the puzzles are not too hard but not too easy really either.  There are as usual, ""sigh"" some problems with bugs and glitchy behavior.  On a couple of occasions I've had some serious discussions with the camera which sucks, I mean really sucks.  Oh and there are some problems with movement, it's not as tight as you might expect leading to some untimely demises, and the annoyance of knowing it wasn't anything you did, it's just a glitchy control setup got ya killed.  But hey it wouldn't be a TR game if it was perfect would it? No it wouldn't.  Give it go, it won't disappoint anyone who ever liked a Tomb Raider game, really.",negative

3553,"Do you like zombies? If yes, you'll love this game. If not, you'll love this game.

Dying Light is an amazing first-person zombie apocalypse-themed game set in an open world. Yes, zombies. Yes, open world. You will traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious epidemic, scavenge the world for supplies and craft weapons to defend against the growing infected population with a heavy focus on parkour mechanics, allowing you to perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping off from edges, sliding, jumping from roofs to roofs and zip-lining.

When I heard about the game, I watched the trailer and saw that it was built around the idea of parkour. My main reservation was wondering how they would incorporate zombies and parkour into a successful game. Unfortunately, I held off on buying the game for quite some time before actually giving it a shot. That was a mistake. The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee weapons. There are more than 100 weapons that can be used and more than 1000 weapon possibilities when players begin crafting new weapons. The melee-weapons have a limited lifespan and will be degraded and eventually broken if you use it for combat for a long time. Yes you can repair the weapon, but only for a limited number of times. Crafting weapons require crafting ingredients such as gauze and metal parts and a blueprint, which can be scavenged or purchased from a shop. I can't even continue to describe how amazing the developers did at incorporating a true survival world and immerse you in it.

Most impressive is how much the day-night cycle changes the game drastically, as enemies become more aggressive and more difficult to deal with during night time. I've literally sped the game up to daytime just to avoid how scary playing at night is. I don't think there is a person that owns this game that hasn't, at one point or another, gotten completely spooked at night-time. While you do have a choice in changing between day and night, there are a lot of quests that force you to play at night.

If you like zombies, buy this game. If you like open world, buy this game. If you like survival, buy this game. You will not be disappointed!",negative
3554,"I really don't know what everyone is complaining about when it comes to this game on pc, too many pc users complain that consoles are holding us back one minute then whining that a game is unoptimized when their system can't handle it for whatever reason. When I first started this game I was having a few hiccups running the game maxed out on my triple monitor setup, but I checked and saw that the vram was being maxed out, so I lowered the texture resolution and problem solved.",negative
3555,"Bought this as a birthday present for my fiance. She loves it. It plays nice, the screen is clear. It came exactly as the seller described. Thank you for being honest in your product description. There were small scuffs, as stated, but NO WHERE near as bad as I thought.",negative
3556,"If you liked Uncharted 1 and 2 this one is a nobrainer.  I will say that the shooting can feel a bit stiff this time around but supposedly they're working on a patch to make it feel more like Uncharted 2. I really only feel it's a problem when I'm shooting someone really far away.

The visuals are perfect and toward the end the game has some pretty stylized scenes involving the desert.  The story is interesting and it seriously leaves you on the edge of your seat.  This time around I feel there is a sense of mortality that the previous games had.  Before Drake was just lucky and things worked out his way, this time it's so extreme it's almost like a super-hero ability but after every scene Nathan really comes off as having just survived death.  It adds something to the experience.

I will also note, I feel this game might be a bit more difficult than the previous games.  I beat the game on hard and I feel I had to restart as many gunfights as I had to on Crushing in Uncharted 2.  If you plan on getting that Platinum expect a decent challenge.",positive

3577,"Those of you that enjoyed the first Burnout, will absolutely LOVE the sequel.  The number of improvements are mind blowing.  Here is what I loved:
1. Crashes are so real that you'll be jumping and screaming with amazement from your seat.
2. XBox Live support for your high scores, biggest crashes, longest drift, best times, biggest air, etc.  You can even easily compare your scores with your friend's scores.
3. Pursuit mode - You choose the cop car and the getaway car.  Also available in exciting multiplayer mode.
4. The physics are 1000% better than the first Burnout.  You can actually leave the roadway, flipping and spinning in the air with parts flying everywhere.
5. Not only does the built in soundtrack change while you're driving, but this also happens to your custom soundtracks.
6. TONS of races and it seems like thousands of miles of road.
7. The cars are much more detailed with life like deformations, plenty of more colors and custom series skins.
You've never experienced a full 160 mph power slide across 6 lanes of oncoming traffic until you've played Burnout 2.  Buy it, don't rent it.  You won't be disappointed.",positive

It helps with the nostalgia.  :)  But seriously, great find, and bring back memories",positive
3583,"DeBlob is a game that has always LOOKED great.  Through screenshots and early gameplay footage, it's always looked like a very promising title.  Even the box art LOOKS great, but with the power of current gen consoles, a lot of games can look great, and play horribly.  DeBlob thankfully lives up to its style and graphical prowess.  The game is just as fun as it looks like it would be.

You play the part of a paint ball, jumping around a gray world, painting the town red (or green, yellow, orange, etc.)  Meanwhile the evil 'Inkies' are dead set on keeping things dull and rubbing you out.  The people of a the world are depressed and oppressed, and it's up to you and an underground group of rebels to set them free.

The game is just FUN.  It's great fun jumping from building to building slopping paint around everywhere you go.  Even on the load screen, you can point the wiimote at the screen and doodle while you're waiting.  The game just oozes with personality.  It's got the dry sense of humor of the Rabbids games, or early Lucasarts titles.  There are lots of challenges set up along the way (ie. paint 50 buildings yellow in 60 seconds, etc.) to keep things interesting, or you can just explore and try to paint all the tree, buildings or townsfolk before the (generous) timer runs out.

My only knock is the lack of a jump button.  It's something many players have mentioned.  You jump by flicking the wiimote down, and while it works, its just not as accurate as a button press.  The controls are very responsive however and this is only a slight setback.

DeBlob is easy enough for children, and at the same time offers enough extra challenges for any level of gamer, and is an all around great family game.  It's a clear 'must own' title for the Wii and one that should not be overlooked.  I hope gamers will choose to support DeBlob so publishers will take more risks with titles like this!  No more shovelware!",negative
3584,"This game is the probably the best Mario Kart game in the series.  Obviously, unlike the other Mario Kart games, you can have two people racing in one kart.  This is a great feature for people who have siblings who sometimes want to team up and win things usually only available in One-Player Mode.  The unlocks include new karts, tracks, characters, modes, arenas, etc.  The battle games and arenas are pretty fun but I still miss the classic Block City from Nintendo 64's Mario Kart.  This is a great Single a Multiplayer game.  I recommend this to anyone ready for fun.",positive
3585,"Quick reviews (no spoilers): You play 3 campaigns /1/ for each character. Each is about 12-15 hrs minimum, but you could play up to 20-25 if you try to 100 percent them. Note* if you want the secret ending it is far easier to get on proud difficulty than standard. The game itself feels like a great side story to the series and is very worth it for its story and gameplay mechanics. I really enjoyed the magic level up and meld system which for me gave the game far more deapth than the early kh games. I have just finished my campaigns and unlocked everything with putting in about 70 hrs. The last piece that really brought this together for a five star rating is the limited text dialoge. Most convo's are voice acted which for me brings the chatacters to life.  Suggested playing with power supply then selected accelerated Processor from ingame menu for quicker load times. That was the only downfall!!",neutral

3589,"I been a Naruto fan since 2008 when I been playing almost every Naruto game made. Like any other Anime to Video game the video game ties with the anime. When I heard of Naruto Ultimate Ninja: Storm was exclusive for the PS3 I knew it was a game to buy. Naruto Ultimate Ninja: Storm is the first part of the anime from Naruto being a kid. Months later Naruto Ultimate Ninja: Storm 2 was announce I knew I had to buy it too. With added characters to use and new gameplay it was a most. Now Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Storm Generations is out and the game as gone far to adding 70+ characters to use. This game touches from the start to about when Tobi""Madara""  declarers war to the 5 Kages or also known as the Kage Summit. The game introduces the new ""beast mode"" or also known ""Awakening Mode"" in which all characters when they are in their last health bar could turn into beast with strong attacks. For example Naruto could change into his tailed beast chakra mode or Sasuke turns into Susanoo.
Story Mode covers Part 1 and 2 of the Naruto Series. The story in which is an emotional roller coaster between Naruto and Sasuke and the Naruto characters. the Story mode there is around 9 different stories. All of the 9 characters are there point of view of the story. really nothing new if u been watching the Naruto Anime but gives some new views and some never before seen clips of the anime. For example The Story of the Masked Man shows Madara Fight against the 1st Hokage. The Story mode starts with a clip and then goes into pictures and talking. I found this part little disappointing because there is really no animation on pics. also found that you kind really find the order of the story since you could mostly just choose a story.
The Gameplay plays like any other Naruto game in which u use the Triangle to use chakra or hold to gain Chakra. The Square throws kunais, The X button to jump and the Circle Button to attack. The blocking system is different compare to the other games. This time you have Certain amount of Substitutions wood before you have to get more. This changes the Fighting in choosing when to use this. The Fighting could get little repeatable in the attacks but makes this game easy to learn with not many buttons to learn.
This game has a lot of unlockables from characters, to support, power ups, character info, and Titles for online play. The online play is also a plus which gives the player a challenge to play real players. For people who wants to get all the trophies for this game will have a fun time doing it by playing this game for awhile. So much gameplay. The Game also has Tournaments and Endless Battles. In tournament mode you could do the Exams in which you choose one character and it put the player into a tournament against other chracters or you could just go with what ever you want. In Endless battles you will fight until one of CPU beats you. You fight after fight with no stop. You could also play this modes online.",neutral

3592,"How many times as a kid did you wish you go go exploring in the worlds of Disney? Ever want to swim like Ariel or fly like Peter Pan? Well, you can do all of that and plenty more!
This game is amazing. You play as Sora, who is on a quest for his lost friends after an evil force rips their world apart. Along the way, you get the help of Donald and Goofy, and depending on the world, help from Disney favorites as Jack Skellington, Beast, and Tarzan!
The game itself is long--like 30 plus hours of game play. There are many side quests and the game is fairly open eneded. One of my favorite side quests was the ""100 Acre Woods"" in which you get to play with Pooh, Pigglet and all your 100 Acre friends.
There is no graphic violence (a shock for a PS2 game!) which makes it suitable for the entire family. In fact, my son who is very young, likes to watch daddy play with some of his favorite characters.

3594,"Revenge of the Sith is a 17 level story about love, loss and betrayal. Since this is a game that is based on the movie, the game follows it, and let me just say, the movie Revenge of the Sith will be awesome! Now on to the game.

The game play for this game truly is top notch. The moves in the game connect so well and so natural, it's as if you are literally in the movie. The controls are easy to learn and they teach you the different moves as you progress through the game. The difficulty on this game is challenging, but not impossible.

This game is mainly action/adventure but adds a little RPG into the mix by letting you upgrade the force powers. All of the force powers start off at level one, but as you earn experience, you can spend the experience to upgrade your power all the way to level three. If you do very well, you will up grade your character. You earn experience by killing enemies, the more impressive the finishing move on your enemies are, the more points you get. As I have mentioned, your character will be upgraded if enough enemies are killed. Obi-Wan and Anakin both start off at Jedi, but as you progress, they can eventually become Jedi Knight and finally Jedi Master.

In the game, there are also hidden health and force upgrades that allow your health and force energy bars longer and gives you more health and force capacity which is very helpful. Besides light saber battles, you also mount cannons to fire at certain object to complete certain goals, there is variety.

Multi-player can be done with a friend or a computer partner in the dual. The dual is characters that are unlocked battling each other like a fighting game, and it is treated as such.

The look is equally amazing. You can tell how much detail that was put into the game, very beautiful watch as you play. The characters are very detailed and the background is equally astonishing. As you fight, different things are happening in the back ground i.e. ships exploding and fighting as you fight Count Dooku. A lot of time was put into this and it really does show.

The story is told by actual movie scenes. When the movie scene ends, you begin to play and vice verse, as you play in the game it will cut to movie scenes. Both are very well done and work very well to help make the ultimate movie experience.

The music adds to this game. To the beautiful peaceful music, to the Star Wars theme, to the Darth Vader theme as Anakin begins to change, it really does set the mood.

As always, this game has extras, although be it not many. The only extras that can be unlocked in the Special Features menu are lots and lots of concept arts for the game. In the Special Features, you can also view the movies of the levels you have completed and you can also view the end credits.

The game really shines by having bonus missions that are unlocked as you beat certain levels. These bonus missions add game play to this game after the main game is finished. You play as certain different individuals and completing certain tasks, usually you have to beat a certain amount of enemies or survive. After the 17th mission is complete, an extra 5th bonus mission featuring the mechanical Darth Vader of Episode IV can be unlocked.

Besides lack of real extras, there is only one negative thing that can be said about this game and that it's not long enough. Sadly, this game doesn't go scene for scene in the movie and skips quite a lot of story. It mainly focuses on the action parts of the film, which is understandable; Lucas didn't want the entire movie spoiled before it was in theaters. There is nothing in this game about Anakin and Padme, but they do focus on the friendship between him and Obi-Wan. With that being said, this game is about six to eight hours long, depending on how long it takes you personally to beat the game. If everything in the movie was added, this would have been longer.

Finally, overall, despite the lack of extras, this game is a must have for all Star Wars fans. I haven't had this much fun in a Star Wars game since Knights of the Old Republic. Since it follows the movie, this game does contain A LOT of spoilers, so if you don't want the movie spoiled, don't buy until after you see the film. Luckily, it has a high replay value. So it is worth your money, especially if you want to get an early look at the film, or have something to remember the film by until you have the DVD movie. I recommend this to all!",positive

3608,"Yes, I'm going to hop on board too by saying the Wii version is what you should play, and since buying this during its first print run is the only way how, I could only express my cravings for the genuine game here. Before I get to talking about the game itself, however, I would like to mention the troubled history behind this; remember how Rayman Legends got delayed by several months (and onto the same month as GTA 5 no less) even though it was completed? Yeah....That game had it easy compared to this! That game was at least virtually the same on all consoles and didn't have to wait around FOUR YEARS! Unless Prope can fight it and put their Wii game onto the eShop, the only way this version of Rodea the Sky Soldier can be played is buy purchasing this during its first print run (or the lucky eBay purchase when the time comes) as it takes the backseat to Kadokawa's inferior takes on the title. Since I've given the Wii U version to my little brother instead of played it, I won't be discussing it, but after seeing comparison footage, something tells me not much of what I will say here will apply to it.

That said, Rodea the Sky Soldier is the long-awaited Wii brainchild of Yuji Naka and his ""indie"" development team, Prope (before they got shafted to the side for the Wii U/3DS versions anyway). Seeing a Wii game be released in late 2015 is pretty surreal enough, but seeing that it's also pretty darn good makes it all the better to see that the Wii will be finishing off strongly.

If there's one word I could describe this game as, it's ""imaginative"". Holy CRAP, the floating worlds are some of the most beautiful things I've seen on Wii since Nintendo's own Super Mario Galaxy planetoids! The fact that the framerate could mostly wind up being a smooth 60fps (although it's not without certain framerate bumps in certain places) makes swiftly flying across the sky and aerial combat even more exhilarating! Not to mention, for a game whose controls only focus around pointing and clicking with the Wii Remote, Prope sure knows how to produce a quality action title with an almost arcade-like feel to it! The whole thing as a result tends to feel like a Dreamcast-era game - kind of a savory combination of Nights and Sonic Adventure.

The game may have a linear structure to it in terms of progression (though of course there's plenty to explore in the levels themselves), but Rodea still tells a story throughout in a similar fashion to games like Kid Icarus Uprising, in which there will be ""cutscenes"", actual cutscenes, and spoken dialogue during gameplay. While the story itself is interesting enough, and even has some lighthearted humor, the voice acting........is pretty clunky, to put it nicely.

Another thing that could've been improved is the camera - While the point-and-click formula works finely enough, there are a few instances where I feel like the Wii Remote is doing more than it could handle, since I also had to use it to turn the camera around for a better view. This won't happen too often, and it's not a dealbreaker despite how it sounds, but I do wish I was able to use the Nunchuck to turn the camera with its analog stick.

Voice acting and slight camera issues aside, I simply adore this game! Kadokawa and NIS better make sure my $60 go to Prope, because this Wii Rodea the Sky Soldier is why I bought this, and they deserve it for their work on the quality pseudo-Sega experience it provides. It's a real shame that it's doomed to become a rare hidden gem (unless they all make the wise choice to put it on the Wii U eShop). I know I for one will hold onto my copy. Thank you, Mr. Naka and Co.",neutral
3609,"The premise here is simple. This is a faux stompbox/effects pedal modeled after the classic Big Muff distortion pedal. Stomp it when your energy meter is full instead of tilting the guitar and you go into overdrive mode.

That's it. That's the whole thing in a nutshell.

The stompbox itself is surprisingly sturdy, almost shockingly so. Don't worry about your friends who have had one too many smashing it into pieces. This thing is made to last.

You'll need to be wearing shoes, though. It has the old-fashioned steel peg button rather than the modern flat switch seen on the popular Boss effects pedals, which means stomping this in bare feet will HURT. But this design also keeps it authentic to the super cool Big Muff look and feel.

It's a wired peripheral, not cordless, so you'll be adding some wiring to your setup. It's made for Rock Band 2 guitars, so don't expect to be using this with your old Guitar Hero guitars.

All around a fun peripheral that will enhance the Rock Band vibe at parties, and will make life a bit easier for newbies and expert players alike. For the price it's hard to beat.",neutral

3611,"I haven't played any online game since Counter Strike. I wanted to get back into the online gaming community, but fear that I don't have a good computer, or that I am getting too old to be playing (I'm 24 years old). I have been following Call Of Duty 4 (the 360 version) for some time since its release. The main appeal is the ""modern"" combat aspect. However, when I first got my 360, I played Call of Duty 2 (not online) and did not really like the game.

So finally I got my tax refund back. I asked myself what I wanted? I broke my 92FS (a handgun like the M9) some time ago (the slide broke after about 10K rounds), and I was deciding to go buy another one. Then I said to myself I am not too fond of starting to shoot again. I liked shooting, but I fear I am losing my hearing from firing too much (even though I wear hearing protections). Why shoot real weapons that are nosiy, loud, possibly deadly (the slide broke from my 92FS scared me and I thought I lost a finger at first), and dangerous? So I was on the hunt for a ""virtual"" experience. Then Call of Duty 4 came to mind. I went and bought with one year of xbox Live and went home and connected. From the first moment, my thoughts were, ""Wow!""

Here are some things I like and don't like:

* Nice online community. I thought I was in for real troubles. I found that the online community is helpful and most people you meet online are fun to be with. I feel the news about the online world is completely exaggerating. I am 24 and I found the people to be nice to you and that most of them aren't much older or younger than you are. I have one real life friend who plays this game, but most of the time, I play with people I don't know and they are nice 99% of the time.

* You can level up by scoring kills, and playing the game online. With each level up, you get new weapons, perks (I'll explain later), and game modes.

* You get awesome weapons that you can customize. After so many kills with a particular weapon, you get new attachments and camo. For example, if you get 25 kills with the M16, you get a Red Dot to make shooting easier. Also, if you get 25 headshots, you get a new gun camo. You also get a cool gold plated gun - on certain weapons - after completing the kills/headshots for all weapons of that category.

* Single player is awesome! The story line is awesome and at two points in the story you can fly an AC130 (truly great) and be a Marine door gunner. I cannot tell you how exciting it is to join the ""Mile High Club."" If you don't know, the Mile High Club is an achievement given to those who complete the last level on veteran mode (the hardest game mode).

* Online Perks. You can set up to three perks. As with weapons, after a certain level, you unlock a new perk. Perks ranges from increased health, increase damages, ability to sprint, drop a grenade when you're dead, and so fort. Each perk can be used depending on your playing style. Some people complain about the perks online, however, they are all quite fun and I recommend switching them up to suit your playing style.

* Call in airstrikes, helo, and provide UAV support. The game is all about teamwork. On average, you will find one or two good people on your team who attempts to work as a team. Basically, after so many kills you can call in airstrikes and give helo support (you only call them in, but you don't actually control or fly them). On hardcore mode - a mode where friendly fire is on and damages are increased - it is almost essential to communicate with your team as you call in airstrikes and helos.

* Graphics are awesome. Honestly, I can't believe how far along we've come in computer graphics. The graphics are liquid fast in the game. On a hdtv, your eyes will bleed from the beauty. Not only that, on multiplayer you can hide in tall grass and so fort to avoid detection from your enemies. It is truly a bonus from the old games of simply running around and shoot. Now you actually have to be careful and think in 3D as you try to make you way through the ranks.

* Respawn can either be a blessing or a curse. Most of the time, you respawn away from the enemy. Unlike other games where you respawn at one point, Call of Duty 4 attempts to spawn you at the best location to prevent ""spawn camping."" Most of the time it works; the enemy team takes over your spawn, then you respawn on the other side of the map without fear. Other times, you're not so lucky. You might respawn at odd locations. Sometimes it takes me a moment to realize exactly where I respawn and try to get a fix on my location. During this time, you might accidentally run into an enemy. Also, sometimes you get unlucky and spawn in an airstrike area where you will die - possibly twice.

* Grenades, flashbangs, and stun don't affect your teammate. On regular game modes - except in Hardcore - you don't have to worry about hurting your team mates. This is good for beginners who often make the mistake of killing his own teammates which can result in rather unhappy times.

* Killcam. This is awesome. After you get killed, you can watch how the enemy killed you. This is ideal to get a fix on hard to see snipers and you can easily avoid making the same error.

Overall, it is a great game. The single player is far better than Call of Duty 2 that I played. I say get this game if you like Counter Strike or Rainbow Six 3 series. Right now, I recommend getting the Game of the Year edition since you get the free map pack - otherwise you'll have to spend roughly 8 dollars to get the new map pack.",positive

3613,"Civilization II was the first turn-based stategy game I ever played. Heck, it was the first strategy game I ever played period. And it was amazing. Take control of a civilization and guide from the dark ages all the way to the launch of a space ship to an alien world. The only way you can possibly describe a game that attempts to simulate all of history is EPIC. Civilization II was greatly loved, and with good reason. It was quite possibly the most addictive strategy game ever when it was released. So when people heard about a sequel to what many considered the greatest game of all time...
Alpha Centauri. In my opinion, this IS the greatest computer strategy game ever, to say nothing of the greatest turn-based computer strategy game ever. There is just so much to love.
First, this game is amazingly engineered. It had VERY low system requirements when it came out, and runs fantastically on a modern machine. The interface is brilliant. The graphics are clean and detailed. The background sounds are perfect. When a technology comes up, you get a voice reading about it, when you build a wonder, you get a cool movie to watch.
And there are so many ways to play within each game. You can micro-manage everything, telling your formers exactly what to do, telling every city exactly what to build, designing your own unit types. Or you can set formers, cities, and units to be completely automatic.
And of course each leader you can choose has distinct advantages and disadvantages, lending themselves to different playstyles. It would take quite a while to master every faction and playstyle in this game.
And I haven't even gone into the multi-player, the senarios, and the fact that almost EVERYTHING in the rules of the game is customizable. I believe there are about seven or eight ways to win! But of course the the harder ways take longer and give a higher score...
In conclusion I will say this. This would be a great game if it were merely civilization in space. But what makes it the best of all time for me is the story. There is a sci-fi storyline to this game, and when interacting with other faction leaders you almost feel like you're watching a historical epic with you as one of the main characters (at least that's how I felt the first time I played). I once even found myself daydreaming about conversations I was having with different faction leaders. Maybe I had just gone a little too long without sleep, maybe I was just playing a little too much, or maybe...this is the greatest strategy game ever made. Now to get back to reading the prologue I downloaded off of the offical website and download some wallpaper...",positive
3614,"I would totally recommend this game to any parent who wants to provide their child with a fun way to enhance their math skills.  My son was struggling a little bit so I purchased this game for him.  It's not boring and he seems to enjoy playing it.  At first when I showed him the game, he was disappointed because it was a MATH game.....it can't be that much fun, but he actually loves it.  It's been keeping him busy and away from the Playstation and Wii and he's actually has gotten a lot better in math because of this game!",positive
3615,"All these people that are giving this game like a 1 or 2 stars just because they say it can't detect your voice or what you write really don't know what they're talking about. I write extremely sloppy at times and it still detects what I write. I would have to say that the writing recognition is superb, and borderline amazing. I do chicken scratch 3's and other numbers, and yet it still knows what I'm writing. And as far as ""blue"" goes, well that is the only color that can give you trouble sometimes, but once you figure out what works for you it just isn't a problem. Other than these complaints that seem to come from nowhere, this game is a great way to keep your mind active and truly a breakthrough for any portable gaming device. Great to have if your looking to stay sharp, or great to have if your simply looking for some fun, especially with Sudoku. Get it!",positive

3623,"The biggest game developer around is back with it's NFL reprise of Madden 2005. It boasts gobs of new features to warrant a buy and most importantly for XBOX owners, this game is XBOX Live compatible. But let's hold that thought, E.A. recently released NCAA 2005 and I still stand by my thoughts on that game, it's still in beta stages an was not released, will Madden suffer the same fate? Read on.

If you don't know already and if you own the game, you know NCAA has some technical issues and there certainly was a concern that Madden might suffer the same. Most noteworthy is the ""slowdown"" during gameplay and bugs that occur on XBOX Live; disconnects, getting charged for losses, slow gameplay and a gob of frustration for XBOX owners. Well, now we come to Madden. Three weeks to iron things out is an eternity for E.A. because it seems like things are ironed out and I'm happy to say Madden plays much better in terms of overall bugginess, it's a finished product.

The big feature this year of course is the ""XBOX Live"" addition along with PS2's online capability. Both run magnificently and I only noticed a couple of times where I would get disconnected. Even better the game plays very smooth overall and does not suffer any problems that NCAA had or still has. Madden includes some nice new features, nothing massive, but keeps the game from getting stale next to 2004, and now being online, that alone is a good enough upgrade for me anyway.

Gameplay: Madden is Madden and the feel of Madden has not really changed year after year. But what E.A. does year after year is tweak the already great feel of the series. Considering the big picture, the gameplay is basically identical from last year with the exception of a few additions.. The same standard button layout is here for both offense and defense, jukes, spins, dives, stiff arms, celebrations etc. They did do away with the ""hurdle"" button this year which was executed with the ""triangle (Ps2) and ""Y"" button on XBOX. Instead, this button is basically the ""put your head down"" and get extra yards button. It's somewhat reminiscent of the ""shoulder charge"" button on ESPN's game which is good for punishing the defense when you need that extra yard. On E.A's game it's more for protecting the ball from a fumble, so press this button down when you're getting swarmed by multiple tacklers to prevent a turnover..

The big hit button is the nicest new addition on defense. It really is fun to use and can take a toll on the offense if used frequently and successfully enough. It's causes the offense to incur more turnovers, especially after a big catch or handoff. Time it right a millisecond before the receiver catches the ball then slam him with the big hit button and watch the ball pop out. It takes timing, but perfect it and you'll be hard to stop on the defensive side. Speaking of defense, the A.I. is much better at reacting to a high power offense in 2005. As in 2004, Game players who rely solely on the pass will have fits of rage when the defense intercepts the quarterback on a frequent basis after figuring out your play-calling methods. The challenge, especially when you beef up the difficulty, will challenge the hardest-hitting game players out there. The control scheme is identical to last year with some minor differentials in the line audibles and play calling screen. You'll still experience the same cool juke moves, stiff-arms, spins and sprint are all back and the tighter feel is more apparent then ever. Offense still has the advantage this year, but I noticed a lot more intelligent blitzing, better play selection and a much improved computer assistance when playing on defense. Linebackers seem to react better, both in knocking down an reacting to a pass, they always seem to be there waiting for the big hit. 2004 gave up to many big plays, I didn't notice big plays nearly as much, at least not yet. Defending against the pass is a breeze if your defensive corner back is in the right place at the right time. Knocking down passes also seems much easier, with the press of the ""triangle"" button and with good timing on your part, defending the pass can become a breeze if you know a thing or too about calling plays. You can still call the hot routes on the fly and can change your star receivers formation (Playmaker) with a click of the right control stick.",positive

Update April 24th

I purchased this game in January after getting tired of Brawl. This game is a lot of fun and has tons of content. I love how they included 8 player smash so more people can play. The events are fun, I like doing classic mode and stadium, and the online is good. I go to a  group with my Wii U so 2 to 8 of us can play at once. Overall it is a blast to play alone, with my group  and my older brother.  Also there's tons of Great DLC that I purchased about 2 weeks ago. Overall this game is fantastic game. So if you have a Wii U but don't have this then something ain't right. If you don't have a Wii U and want this game, then pick up a Wii U for this game. Your Wii U game library isn't complete without it.",positive

3632,"Finally a hulk game that allows you to use the hulks abilities as they were meant to be used. Theis game allows you to destroy anything even a couple of buildings are destructable. The Hulk can take a car and make steel fist out of it or he can take a bus and make a surf board out of it. Note you just start off with basic moves. When you complete a chapter you get new ones to buy there are 150 in all. Even tanks are surfable. You won't start off with surf thou you have to buy it later in the game. Everything is you weapon poles,trees even circular gas station signs which can be bowled into cars,people etc and the explosions are very well rendered. You can choose to free roam and also do challenge missions or you can do story mode when you get ready too. Also you can jump between the city and the badlands. Hulk can also harm innocent civilins on the street. He can also put them down and pat them on the head or flick them which is funny. The bosses you will face or the Abomination,Mercy,Hulkbusters,Helicopters and Tanks. On a boss mission you might have 4 helicopters shooting missiles at you at once along with tanks and hulkbusters. There are also some interesting codes for this game that make it funner to play.

Cabbies  All vehicles become cabs
America  Hulk wears shorts with the American flag
Retro  Black and White graphics
Ocanada  Canada Flag Pants
Chzgun  Cow Missiles
Destroy  Double Hulks damage ability
Bringit  Double value of health pickups

Suitfit  Unlocks Joe Fixit(Grey Hulk)skin with Tuxedo
Classic  Unlocks classic Grey Hulk without Tuxedo
Pillows  Unlocks Low Gravity Mode
Transit  Unlocks Mass transit mode
Froggie  Wild Traffic

Note some of these codes can't be unlocked till you find the comic book covers there are 60. Some of them can be all the flag shorts can be entered in the code imput before you find the comics as well as smash 5,10,15 and others.

Savage Banner will be in the Moves shop to buy once you finish the game however he cost about 1 Million smash points to buy and for those of you that may not know he will be able to destroy everything like the hulk but will be much smaller.

The cheats once entered will stay there. You can just toggle between the characters you want to play Savage Hulk,America etc.

This game is so much better than the first hulk game for several reasons.

1)Everything in this game can be used as a weapon
2)Almost everything is destroyable
3)Hulk can weaponize cars
4)Hulk can run and walk up walls
5)Hulk gets to wear differnt kinds of shorts
6)You get to play as the Abomination and Savage Banner.
7)There are no normal Banner missions.
8)You can swing tanks around once you buy the move.
9)You can surf on busses and tanks.
10)You can catch missiles and throw them back at helicopters and tanks once you buy the move.

The producers and makers of the Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction said that people will determine if a new one gets made so please everyone that likes the hulk,comicbook games and action games buy this.

Other games I recommend are:
1)The Hulk-Even thou Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction is out now The Hulk game offers bosses that's not in the new one such as Madman,Ravage,Flux,The Leader,Halflife,Gamma Guards,Robots and Hulk Dogs and you can destroy some stuff in it as well.

2)Spiderman 2 The first comic book game that started free roam for comics and allows some great webslinging and fighting moves for Spiderman and even has a fight arena when you finish the game.

3)Batman Begins

4)Jaws Unleashed Coming Jan 1st for xbox,ps2 and pc. This game will allow you to play as the Great White Shark terrorising people,other sharks,killer whales etc. The game has 50 sea creatures ranging from the seahorse to the biggest whales. So far confirmed are Other Great Whites which you will fight with,Killer Whales,Giant Squids,Barracudas,Hammerhead Sharks,Blue Whales,Dolphins,and seahorses. No doubt there will be other killer sharks like the tiger and the bull and I'm hoping to see the Salt Water Crocodile as a boss. This game will be rated M for Mature due to blood,gore and graphic violence but it will still be a great game because it allows you to play as the white shark a first in the world of consoles. This game will even let you target which body part you take off at least 25 dismemorant enjine. I generally don't buy M rated games but will make an exception with this game. Also expect to see some references to the Jaws Movie in this game.

5)Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith

6)Ace Combat 5

7)Ace Combat 4

8)Ace Combat Zero The Belkin War Coming sometimes in the Summer or Fall of 2006. This is actually a prequel to Ace 5 which highlights the Belkin War the flying will be like Ace 5. If you like flight sim games this will be a good one to pick up.",neutral

3637,"I really enjoyed this game even though it has it's quirks and it's shorter than many.  While it doesn't have the addictive nature of EDF 2017 which I played for over a year and finished at 100% (twice) and still enjoy going back to with it's cheesy graphics and Starship Troopers dialogue, this game has very inventive weapons IMO and in fact you may need to fart around spending time just getting used to all the Drone weapons which are quite cool once you get the hang of it.

It's never so hard that you want to give up and rarely do they leave you stuck in an area where you cannot replenish your ammo but you must keep your eyes out for where they leave advanced weapons as you don't want to suddenly be battling a Tank or a Sniper and no advanced weapons to use.

The more you make yourself prone the more accurate the hits on the enemy but beware many of them are wearing body armor including helmets with added protection and damn it can take a helluva lot of shots to take them down at times.

One quirk I noticed that's troubling is the dang Sniper Rifles and I was an expert marksman that went through Guerilla warfare training for Vietnam and in this game you give the enemy a head shot with a high powered Sniper Rifle and how the hell they survive doesn't make sense - Head Shots from an automatic at distance with armor protected helmet yes perhaps, but not a high powered sniper rifle. Don't expect the sniper rifles to work anything like those in Halo 3 where headshots are 100% kills.

There's one level where your dropped alone in the hills to use the sniper and damn if most will survive the headshots - always prep for the follow-up shot.  Another quirk is the AI of your squads - sometimes your surrounded by them supposedly fighting with you and they are firing like hell at the enemy and it seems they aren't hitting anyone at times and your doing it all and it gets you cussing at squad because they seemingly cannot hit anyone thats directly in the line of fire of four of your soldiers and makes you think are you guys friggin BLIND!

The vehicles do not have the terrific fluidity of a Halo 3 so it can be frustrating at times with the Tanks and often I'll jump out of the tank and use the Rocket Launcher with auto aiming and it kicks butt as long as you don't expose yourself in the open for too long.  That rocket launcher and mini helicopter missile firing drone are the MVP weapons as are some of the drones once you get used to them.

Despite the quirks I enjoyed it very much and it has good replay as you are in control of your battle plan tactics (though it won't let you leave a battle) you decide the tactics and no one else on each level.

Hell - great fun for $20 and the storyline is very appropriate for the times we're in today. Just like EDF 2017 many love it and others don't but for $20 no big loss as it still has resale value with next to nothing lost.  Enjoy!

3638,"I've had this game for 9 days now and I couldn't stop playing it. I'm now on level 26, have over $7 Million credits and over 70 cars, and 31 percent game completion. I must say that playing GT3 and GT4 definitely helped me prepare for this. After finishing the entire GT3 and GT4 and the first day of GT5 with a controller, I broke down and bought the Logitech DFGT wheel. My god this driving wheel not only enhances your ability but the overall enjoyment of the game. Really, a driving wheel is a must for this game. While it's true that there's no car damage factor in the game, everything else is spot on realistic. I definitely enjoyed this game more that Forza Motorsport 3. There's so many different aspects of this game that makes it so deep. Driving licenses, special and seasonal challenges, the various A-Spec races...it's all good!  Just be very careful when buying or selling expensive cars and/or modifications because everything's automatically saved and there's no going back for redos. Getting all golds in certain challenges are very hard but so fulfilling and memorable once achieved such as the Go Karts, Jeff Gordon Nascar and Top Gear. For a real challenge, try doing races without the driving line. I haven't even touched the B-Spec yet. The best racing game in my opinion, and I've tried them all. Simply gorgeous on my 42"" plasma screen.

Update...22 days of glorious racing and I completed the game's final special challenge while on level 31. I got all Bronze on Vettel's X1 Challenge. I never sweated so much playing a video game in my life. The sheer sense of achievement and exhilaration felt after successfully finishing Suzuka was just amazing. I also loved the joy I experienced after getting all Gold in Loeb's Rally Challenge. Wow, I got Vettel's Red Bull X2010 to reach a top speed of 307 MPH on the Indy Track(with draft). Also, the Ferrari F1 races in the seasonal events is a great idea. Now I just need to rest my thumbs from the force feedback wheel :)",positive

These are much better, highly recommended.",positive

3643,"I can't think of a single game that caused as much hype and anticipation than this, except maybe Halo 2. But whereas that game had a set release date(famously confirmed when a game member got November 9 tattooed on his arm), Twilight Princess was pretty much delayed so often that people wondered whether the Gamecube would ever get it. Then came a surprise announcement: while it would still be in essence the Gamecube's final knockout blow, it would also be a launch title for Nintendo's recently released Wii system. But unlike let's say Halo or Super Mario 64 which got had an ""anyone can play"" accessibility, Twilight Princess seems mainly geared to the more hardcore crowd but you'll still find one of the best games on any Nintendo machine and probably any of them.

Story: Arguably the most darkest storyline and the first one since Majora's Mask, the game tells the tale of Link living in Ordon Village who gets thrust into a battle between 2 worlds: his world and the ""twilight world"", a world full of vicious creatures and a foreboding atmosphere. With the help of familiar faces, new ones and a new gift, Link once again has to save Hyrule. There's a strange sense of melancholy in the game, like it's not as obviously uplifting like Wind Waker or a game for all seasons like Ocarina of Time with shifting atmospheres, this feels more darker, more epic and more compelling as a result.

Graphics: One common issue brought up with the Wii version's reviews was how un-next gen they looked. On the Gamecube though, this is easily the most gorgeous game that to me even eclipses graphic powerhouses like Resident Evil 4 or Metroid Prime. Graphics look much sharper and detailed and facial expressions during cut-scenes give characters even more personality, including Link. If there is a quibble is that the unmistakable ""Nintendo texture"" pops up where things look kinda blurry up close.

Sound/Music: I noticed a couple of soundbytes in regards to voices but it's strictly one word phrases although it did sound like new character Midna spoke a language. If there's one thing Zelda rarely disappoints in is the music and despite the fact it's not a fully orchestrated soundtrack, it's still got lively tunes and moments of serene gentle melodies.

Gameplay: Since this is the Gamecube version, we don't have to deal with manually aiming, instead using the analog stick like always. You map items onto the Y or X(no Z this time, that's to talk to Midna, your new friend when you enter the twilight world). The major shift is that Link can transform into a wolf which will have controls that will feel at home with Okami fans. Also, Midna acts as a kind of jump helper where at certain points you can actually jump unreachable distances should Midna be over there. Speaking of which, she's not as famously annoying like Navi and will generally be a worthwhile character to have around.

The main thing of course with a Zelda title is the puzzles and this game has some pretty big brain testers but then on the other hand, towering bosses are actually pretty easy so I guess we're exercising our brains more than our bloodlust. You'll find as much as at least 9 or 10 of these dungeons filled with puzzles and bosses, not to mention Hyrule itself is huge and there's plenty of sidequests to do, then of course the story itself can rack up the hours easily. By and large, this is a longer and epic game than we've seen and many will welcome it since it's an easy world to get lost in.

Is it for everyone? Doubt it. Even Mario 64 and Halo had its detractors but as a swan song for the Gamecube, this was a fitting end but more importantly, just an all around perfect game.",positive

Devil dogs - alternate worlds, an unborn heathen God - chaos.

Beautifully made and timeless - no wonder the movie gurus have nicked it for the big screen.

3653,"BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND - This Review is aimed towards newcomers or relatively newcomers to the series. like myself.

This is my second BlazBlue game i've ever played and am happy i skipped all the other games prior to this one except BlazBlue: Portable for the PSP because i had a feeling Arc System Works/Aksys would make a complete super version sooner or later, and they did and being for the PSVita i still get to play it wherever i go as a big bonus, but to finish this sweet deal off its BlazBlue with the graphics and High res EQUAL to that of the PS3 and 360 versions so this time you lose nothing for the on-the-go aspect as the PSVita for this title has just as much graphical power as it's console brethren.

Anyway on to the keypoints of the review.

Presentation* Value* Gameplay* Sound* Overall* based on a Positive, Negative, Neutral, Conclusion rating system.
/______________________/

[Presentation] Score: ''''

Positive: First off let me say that this games overall presentation is fantastic, from the highly detailed subtle UI to the stories of each character, it's all amazing and epic scale, in the end with a great tale that surpasses even current RPG's for that alone this game gets 4 out of 5 stars from me. i was very impressed in the amount of modes available and the way the game overall shows itself off, with Style.

Negative: The only reason it's a 4 star rather than 5 star here in the presentation aspect is because i found this game to have to many female playable characters, i also found the story to have a bit to much plot female characters as well that simply aren't needed to be there and would have been just fine without them like kokonoe and Litchi's nurse. i simply don't prefer my games to have a ridiculous number of women running around, but thats just my preference, even more so in a FIGHTING GAME, i just don't like playing female characters. and that oh so ""As they say"" ""If your gonna play a game for many hours i'd rather stare at a gurls arse rather than a guys"" is childish and immature to say the least, games are for playing first and foremost, not for looking at pixel girls. but it ain't that much of a hassle to me hence the 4 star rating im fine with it here i guess for the most part since games like Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and SoulCaliburV (SCV being a very recent fighting game, just a little over a month ago.) both have a 60% or higher male to female ratio, SCV actually kicked out quite a few of there female characters from the series because they were getting old which is a poor excuse but whatever back to BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND.

I also find this game to be very hard, a lot harder than the only competition this game has, which is Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which seems more casual friendly than this game. if there are any BlazBlue fans out there and you have any pro tips available please comment because i NEED HELP its so hard and since PSVita has online im scared to go near it because i suck so bad lol.

Neutral: For the fairness of it all, as beautiful as the character art in story mode are and as equally nice as the Sprites are in actual gameplay being EQUAL i can't stress this enough EQUAL in in terms of graphical capability to the console brethren, as a 2D and 3D animator myself in which i dabble in casually ever now an' then, the actual animations of the characters in gameplay could have been better, not a lot better just...  better... i've personally animated quite a few 2D original artwork back in the day and it was a lot smoother than this, i just think that the animation should match the HD Sprite quality thats all. and in my opinion it doesn't, feels stiff at times.

Conclusion: '''' ~ In the end the positives out match the negatives with only a minor neutral concern.

As im still playing this game on my PSVita i'll update this review on a daily basis since theres A LOT of content to be unlocked. happy gaming!",positive

3665,"This game has entertained me for about 150 hours.  What else is there to say.  The world is huge and the possibilities are endless.  It's a ""sandbox"" game and I would say it's the best one out there if you are looking for this genre.",positive
3666,"No game packs more bang for your buck into a title; When you finish it the first time, you are ready to go through it again; And then once more...Gone are the old-school controls that made the previous games a mixed blessing; The movement is fluid and highly adaptable; While a strafe mode would have been nice, you get used to this pretty much right away. The graphics are amazing, and the variety of creatures, bosses, and locales are nothing short of impressive. The detail is really...and I hate to use this word...breathtaking. The interactive cut scenes are intense and new in terms of interacting with the game. You can't take a breather in this game during these either, which is refreshing.  Everyone I have loaned this too or given them as a gift has been floored. It is required playing for anyone who appreciates a deep, detailed, involving game that shows you things you have never seen before. So what if Leon looks like an '80's David Bowie...If you haven't played this, and horror is your thing, you are missing out. One of the greatest horror games ever...or just game period.

I have played this on the Gamecube many, many times, and still use the old school GC controller w/this version; the movement is even better than before, def. less 'bobbing' in Leon's step. Have not tried the Wii waving controls w/this.

Simply amazing game that has so much replay value....addictive & fun; but get ready to sweat!!!!",positive

3679,"I'm not really the biggest fan of PSP's, but I do really like the fact that you can easily hook one up to a TV. Some games look better than others. Movies are okay.",positive
3680,"So far, I'm very impressed with this product. It allows you to connect an Xbox controller, Playstation 2 (or Playstation 1) controller and a Gamecube controller to your PC through USB. The great thing is that you can theoretically hook one of each at the same time for 3 players.

So far I haven't been able to test the GC functionality, but I imagine it works as well as the PS2 and Xbox. These adapters are great for getting that ""perfect"" feel for retro gaming, and often these controllers are cheaper and easier to come by than their PC counterparts. So if you have a bunch of consoles at home, and want to use those same controllers on your PC, now you can. Of course one might argue that this means your controllers will wear out faster, but at least in the short run it will save you money and replacing them will be that much easier. Xbox controllers are harder to come by these days, but as of this writing, Gamecube controllers and Dual Shock 2's are still being sold brand new in stores (and not just the third party variants), because of the Wii's emulation of Gamecube and that the PS2 still has new games coming out for it.

I recommend this product, though there are other similar adapters out there for other needs (like if you want to use Saturn or Dreamcast controllers, or attach 4 ps2 or Xbox, etc controllers at once).

There is official software for this product posted on the mayflash website (it also comes with a mini-cd in the package, don't throw out that cardboard before you find it! though of course the website drivers are the most up to date). You can also download a free program called Joy2Key (which allows you to assign keyboard and mouse functions to joystick functions) if you are having problems getting your pads to work with a particular game or app. I haven't tested other types of controllers with this adapter, but usually these adapters are designed for the pads, sticks, dance mats and sometimes racing wheels. Other gimmicky controllers may not work (and lightguns will not work, especially since they usually require a CRT if you don't have one... but look up EMS, they make guns that will work with LCD, Plasma and projection).

Another thing I like about this adapter is that it has a fairly long cord, which functions like an extension to the console controller's wires. Like all USB devices it's plug and play. Some games though only work if you plug in the adapter after starting up the game (in conjunction to Joy2Key).",negative
3681,"This headset is my new standard headset for Xbox gaming.  It's very comfortable, looks nice, and works great.  I can hear the other players just fine, and they can also hear me fine.  The arm swings easily out of the way, and it appears to be as sturdy as a headset like this can be.  It's also the best look headset I've seen.

My only complaint is that the volume/mute control is on the cord instead of on the base, which means I can't mute the microphone without letting go of the controller.  But this is how most headsets are designed.",positive
3682,"Only buy at SRP, don't over pay.",negative
3683,they love it,positive
3684,"Definitely worth the money. Nothing fancy, but it's nice to have good protection for your GBA games.",positive
3685,"This version of Mario Party really changes things up.  As in the past, there is the board game mode with mini-games between turns.  Instead of the day/night differences in the last one, this one has bowser mode every 5 turns.

Instead of collecting stars to win the game, each board has a different object in this one.  In one game you climb up a mountain.  In another you have to fix windmills.  It's a neat way to keep things interesting but still maintain the familiar game play.

The microphone spaces on the game board are all the same.  They really could have changed these up some.  They get boring after a while.

Not sure if it's just my microphone, but it doesn't always recognize what is said.  We were playing a microphone mini-game where numbers are involved, and a person said ""eight"" but the six was hit.  Also, during another game the word ""orange"" was said but the game thought it was ""banana"".

Turning off the microphone option seems to be the best way to go to avoid confusion and family riots.

This version of Mario Party isn't as kid friendly as the previous ones.  The mini-games are a bit more difficult and skill-oriented.  Although, there are still some classic button mashers that the kids love.

Still a great game, but I would recommend Mario Party 4 as the best.",positive
3686,"Keazy Racers will keep any player happy until Mario Kart comes out.  Although Krazy Racers ia a rip of Mario Kart its an excellent game and i recommend that you buy it as its so much fun.  You can choose from 8 players from Konmai's character range and use them over 4 different modes(Time Trial, Gran Prix, Free Mode and Mini Battle)  So there is plenty of play ability in this game",positive

3690,"Having played the original XCOM series on PC, I was not only pleasantly surprised, but had my expectations blown away by the recent XCOM.  Having played the original series on the PC, I played this copy on an xbox 360 and was very happy with it's console deployment.  Navigation and issuance of orders felt natural with a console controller, the developer did an excellent job making a PC Strategy game work well with a console controller.

Also, it's good to note this for newcomers: I've introduced this game to multiple friends, many of whom have no experience with turn-based strategy games.  Every person I've shared it with has been hooked and played the game through to the end.",positive
3691,"I got this case as a Christmas gift. You know this case is rather interesting, while it is small I do like it. I give it 3 stars for what it is capable of holding in the bag and of carrying and 2 stars for surprising me with how much it can fit when you stuff it in there real good, and think about how it all fits and while it may not seem like it can fit much it can actually fit a lot, and its tight, you just have to be smart and figure out where it all goes, and if it doesn't work one way then try another. So I was able to fit:  My Gamecube system with the Gameboy player attached on the bottom, AV Composite Cables, AC power Adapter, 2 White Gamecube 1019 MB Memory cards, 4 Gamecube Wireless Wavebird controllers and there adapters, Gamecube Gameboy Advance Link Cable and extension cable which I use for the Gamecube Gameboy Advance cable. Then for games I used a Gamecube Disc holder which I attach to a ring on the front of the case which I found for $10.00. The strap on this case is not very long its a little short, but it can be adjusted. However the only improvement worth making is to the handle on the outside, its way too small they should've made the handle so it goes on top of the flab which you unzip to open the case. So overall this is a great case, but not for traveling. However I noticed a much nicer case made by ALS Industries and is also a Nintendo product. So I might be getting that one instead.",neutral
3692,"A Well-polished game. I am having a lot of fun playing it. I really appreciate the efforts Projekt Red had put into the game which is very customer-oriented.  BTW, thanks for the free DLC, map, soundtracks and the thanks letter. I am getting used to some mean game publishers such as EA screw us, the customers, over and over again by charging  ""micro-transactions"" such as $4.99 for a helmet or an armor, or if we, the customers,  want to play the whole game, we have to pay EA extra $60,  on top of the $60 we have already paid (eg. Star War).  On the contrary, Projekt Red is just the opposite side of EA. The Witcher 3 makes me heart-warming. It's rare to see a game studio who put the customers first and has moral compass.",positive

The games are fun.  The characters you play against are animated; the conversations/bantering are lively and fun.  The graphics are fine for card games.  Each game has its own settings.

I am pleased with my purchase.  When I'm wanting to play cards, this DVD fits the bill.

3719,"This is the most fun and addictive game I have played in ages.  But first, the bad...
The most common complaint about this game is over its controls.  I assume that this is somewhat exaggerated, however.  My system falls well below the minimum requirements listed on the box, but it still played well enough.  The only frustration I experienced was that the Stranger would sometimes turn too quickly or too slowly, and that would render the more precision-based puzzles very difficult.  However, I still made it through and enjoyed the effort despite my weak computer system.  Some also complain that the camera angles at times interfere with gameplay, but I found that they helped create mood and suspense, and at times when it mad fighting difficult I would just move to a point where I got better visibility (this is less of a problem with auto-aim, but it does sometimes get annoying).
The storylines are quite enthralling, and you will find yourself running off to the computer at every moment to find out what happens next or to further explore the amazing scenery.  The fully rendered graphics and sounds are amazing, and the gameplay is both full of action and brain-teasers.
Each act focuses to a different extent on action vs. adventure gaming and can be played in any order (I recommend doing them in order unless you get stuck and can't get help immediately).  Act 1 and Act 2 are an excellent balance, Act 3 is mainly action, and Act 4 is mainly puzzle solving.  Each Act is also wildly different in its villians and settings, so you never grow bored, and the characters are very well realized and leave you wanting to experience more adventures with them (there are rumours that this will be made into a TV series!).
The basic storyline is that it is the 1930s and you are a mysterious figure with a top secret government agency that hunts monsters.  In Act 1, you team up with Svetlana, a sexy half-human/half-vampire, on a mission through European castles and forests involving vampires and werewolves.  In Act 2, you are on your way to a small western town to clear it of its problems with the walking dead, but the werewolves from Act 1 first try to exact their revenge.  Eventually, you wind up solving a Lovecraftian mystery deep underground with the aid of a voodoo god.  In Act 3, a Chicago gang is bringing its dead members back as Frankenstein monsters and you have to destroy their monster factory, but they are in control of the city.  In Act 4, you must confront a former member of the organization who wants to destroy it for its new politically correct willingness to work with good supernatural creatures and escape all the deadly, devious traps in his house of horrors.  There is a bonus act (basically, a short film), but you can only view it with the editor which you can download from the Nocturne website.
There are many instances of dark humour (you can attack zombies with their own body parts)and pleasant surprises I don't want to spoil as well (including funny but gross little scenes and interesting variations on the creatures (specifically in the zombie town)).  The opening title film is also great (although it unfortunately often just plays the music while you stare at a black screen -- just start the game enough times and you'll see it).  Playing this game is better than watching the X-Files (and it is much more gory and ""adult"").",neutral

Where the Xbox would lag, stutter and randomly disconnect from the internet (as well as a host of other issues) the PS4 has done none of those things. It's very fast. The UI is great. The build quality is better. The graphics are better and the games are better.

The reason I decided to switch was not on my own accord, Xbox decided to ban me out of the blue and for literally no reason, I've never cheated, cursed, or done anything even remotely close to being a bannable offense, with that being said, I'm glad they did and my only regret is that they didn't do it sooner. Couldn't be happier.",neutral

3727,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is definately one of the most visually stunning games on the PS4. It showcasts an amazing variety of shades and colours. Voice acting is on point and is top notch as always (the ""Uh"" on horseback may become slightly annoying when having to spur the horse multiple times). There is not much story on this game which makes it easy for newcomers to fit in and understand, although some concepts and charachers will have to be researched so there is some sort of understanding to the developments of the story.

Currently, only single-player is available.
You are Big Boss (or Snake - MGS3, shoutout to the best MGS!) and you wake up from a 9-year coma after suffering severe injuries in an explosion. You have lost a limb, right eye and translation skills due to a piece of bone lodged into your brain. It is well into the current-future and the Soviets have invaded Afghnistan. Your mission is to cripple and halt this invasion.

During the main campaign missions, the user has around 160 SIDEOPS (side quests) which which are unlocked by completing certain missions or other side ops mission. These SIDEOPS missions are essential for you because you can capture translators, collect resources, take prisoners and soldiers; all which will help you somehow during and after the game.

You will be able to build, expand and create your own motherbase. Currently only change of colours is available. WOuld be nice if you could select the placement of each facility to be able to strategise better for defense against other players. Yes, other players. MGSV: TFP provides the gamer with two types of multiplayer. First is a base invasion style game, where you invade the opponents' motherbase to steal resources, cripple defenses and kill workers there which will cripple your opponents' level in certain areas such as R&D, Medicine, Support, etc. The other mode is 8v8 stealthy gameplay, team deathmatch style. All progression from singleplayer carries on to multiplayer. So it is essential to get started on your motherbase, upgrades, weaponry and good staff. Although the multiplayer for this game seems to be great, co-op campaign and sideops missions would be a blast, in my opinion. Hope a patch is released soon that enables it.

I have played well over 6 hours of the game. I have completed about 4%. This is just campaign and sidequests, since the multiplayer is not even online yet. It is an open world game with much to explore, where you have to go out to find, fulton and bring back resources, animals, personel, and collect diamonds which are sold for in-game currency the GMP. Everything you collect has a purpose. If not monetary, then resourceful.

During the game you will find yourself spending a lot of money, or having to save up a lot of money to make all upgrades and developments you want. It is easy to get money as it is easy to spend it with countless helpful upgrades which vary from armor for your companion horse, your helicopter, vehicles, development of the motherbase, weapons and many more upgrades and purchases.

I would be more than happy to answer to any doubts. However, I need to go as I'm late for work XD//

I needed to replace the MS bluetooth mouse on my primary Laptop as it was failing to work and disconnects often. Upon connecting this with the wireless dongle it came supplied with, I was very please, it works just as well if not better than the other Tecknet mouse I have on a second laptop. Response is quick and the mouse is form fitting to the hand and I love the 2 On options, one for led lights and one w/o. Another feature that surprised me is the auto off/standby when not in use for a few minutes, it turns off the led and goes to sleep, you never need to turn it off using the switch. If the battery in this one lasts as long as my other mouse which I have not changed in over 6 months I'll be stupendously happy. For you gamers out there don't spend 4x more for big name brands, save your money and get this and you will not be disappointed.",neutral

3748,"This game is actually pretty good. A lot of people seem to have been let down by Black and White 2, which I can understand. Black and White 2 becomes tedious.

The Movies is more about producing movies and making money. You can make movies, but you do not have complete freedom. Instead, you have a ton of sets, and like 100 different scenes for every set that you can put actors into. This actually works out pretty well as you can create a ton of different interesting scenes in interesting ways by using tiny pre-built scenes. If you don't want to create movies, you can have script writers do it. There are seemingly billions of movies they can write. I get eager to see what kind of movie they are making when I see interesting titles and such.

You create stars, cast the movie, then shoot it. During the shoot  you can alter the screenwriter's movies slightly. Or, you can let the director shoot it himself and manage your huge studio lot. You unlock more stuff as you progress, and every 5 years there are awards. The awards are hard to get, and I get excited whenever I see my name nominated.

As you progress, your stars start to want things, and eventually they become big. It's really awesome to see one of my stars become such a huge success after doing so many crappy movies. You can give your star plastic surgery and treat him like royalty by giving him an entourage. It works out pretty well, but the only downside to this is that sometimes other stars might get jealous.

There is even an online feature where you can post movies and earn more game stuff.

I would reccomend this movie to anyone who likes The Sims.",positive

3750,"Fallout 3 is now a little old for a game, but in this you get all of the expansion packs at a very reasonable price.  You also have the added advantage of all of the software updates that make the game run smoother and more stable.  I did have an issue starting up the game due to my firewall/Comodo ""defense plus"" interfering with startup on my Windows 7 64bit OS, but after I disabled the offending software the game boots up smoothly.  Gameplay is solid and the bonus of a decent computer is that the game looks way better than when I played it the first time around my Xbox 360- and I'm only running on high detail, not ultra high.

The heart of the game is still the same, and if you haven't played Fallout yet, you may as well do it now, because you're missing out on one of the best game worlds I've ever encountered on any console/platform.  This is one of the best games of the decade (or previous decade, however you count your decades).  What I'm trying to say is, I'm a huge fan.

If you're computer supports/exceeds the specs (and by now you can buy a compatible system or video card for a reasonable price) you are definitely in for a treat.",positive

They kept the balanced fair aspects and threw out the unecessary. Definitely get it if you are a competitive player and if your casual at least they have a good campaign plus the other games come free if you get it before December 31st.

Once I got the patch, the game kicked...  I find myself playing it 24/7.  I enjoy online far more than anything else.  So if you don't have/or have an unreliable ISP than forget this game. But other than that it's fun.  It can be angering though.  I ripped my hand open punching my keyboard.

3770,"This little mouse is the best wireless mouse I have ever seen. For a cheap little electronic from China, this thing is extremely impressive. There are only two DPI settings on the mouse that you can toggle between with the button in the middle, which is very nice. The receiver is the same size as typical micro USB units these days, and has no delay to pick up the mouse's signal. Not to mention, The receiver has a dedicated compartment for it in the battery enclosure, which as very handy, and eliminates the risk of accidentally losing it when it is not in the computer. There are clear plastic parts of the mouse including the wheel that allow the red light of the optical sensor to illuminate, causing the mouse to slightly glow red, which makes for a cool effect. The two side buttons are a little too far forward in my opinion, but that may not be a problem for everyone. The mouse is neither too small nor too large, so it is good for portable use or for office use. No report on the electronic durability yet, but the physical durability is noteworthy. Runs on two AAA batteries then fires up quickly with no installation wizards. very easy and great experience to use. Highly Recommended. The only issue I had was the delivery time. It took one and a half CALENDAR months to arrive, which i think is just a little too long to wait, but hey, its worth the wait for such a great deal!",negative
3771,"Who knew mining on Mars could be this much fun. This game rocks my scrap metal off! Some have complained this game is a bit repetative and i suppose i can agree on that, but i can't seem to get enough of it. Red Faction is all about blowing everything up and it does it in spades. Missions are the typical lot, blow that building up, ambush that convoy, steal that vehicle, intercept that traitor, but its fun gang. Part of the fun is finding out the most efficient and creative way to take a building down. The missions play out like little mini games, one that is particularly satisfying is the demolition trials. The object is to destroy a structure with specific equipment within the alotted time. I played one where the object was to attach sticky bombs onto explosive barrels and drop them down a drainage tube till they landed next to the target building and kaboom! I like these missions as they give me new tactics for taking out the enemy that i may not have even thought about on my own. There are wide variety of vehicles ranging from fast light armored cars to heavy tanks with some serious firepower. I love the robotic walkers you can pilot, they remind of the walker Ripley used in Alien.

The graphics are fantastic and the Martian landscape is truly a sight to behold, it has a very Total Recall feel to it. There is a lot of area to cover too. There are six zones if i remember correctly that you are trying to liberate from the oppressive forces of the EDF (Earth Defense Force). I like the addition of the scavengers that randomly appear here and there wielding their crude weapons, they have a Mad Max feel to them. There a wide variety of weapons at your disposal but you can only carry 4 at a time, one being your trusty hammer. I suppose it is a bit ridiculous that your hammer can bust through solid concrete walls in one hit, but i can overlook that, mainly because this a game and its just plain fun. As you finish missions in each zone, morale raises and more and more miners will pick up arms and join you in your battle which is very helpful because this game can get tough without the help. When they say Guerrilla, they weren't kidding, you really need to utilize hit and run tactics to be successful until you get better weapons and armor later in the game. Overall im very impressed with this title, its a solid game that you can keep coming back to when you feel the need to blow some $h@t up.",positive

I ordered Beyond Divinity from Amazon, assuming that it was guaranteed to include Divine Divinity, but my box didn't have it.

Fast, responsive, and with a micro dongle rather than the gigantic ones most controllers that are USB wireless come with.

Direction pad is easy to press. The sticks are very smooth and center properly, no need to adjust the dead zone (I had to increase the deadzone on my XBox 360 controllers through Dolphin emulator since characters would continue to move on their own). The thumbsticks are buttons as well. 2 triggers, 2 bumpers. Works so far on both my Windows 8 PC, my surface tablet, and my Nvidia Shield portable.

Controller is a little light which makes it feel cheap, but the controller works well so I haven't had any real issues yet.

Input is Direct Input. People who are experiencing problems don't seem to know the difference between XInput and Direct Input, and simply plug in the controller and get frustrated. If you are trying to play Steam games, x360ce is your friend. If you are playing a game that lets you set the keys, this should work fine like any old USB controller would.

3787,"Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess has been dubbed one of the biggest launch titles in history, coming out with the Nintendo Wii on November 19th. The game's appearance on the Nintendo Wii was confirmed by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata at E3 `05, and has since been a target of hype and anticipation like no other. Numerous delays-including the delay of the Gamecube version of the game until December `06-have held Twilight Princess back, but rest assured that Nintendo's flagship Wii title is for real. It's not too bold to say that Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the greatest Zelda game of all time, and Ocarina Of Time sits playing second fiddle.

Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess takes our hero Link to the land of Hyrule (where else?), where a mysterious and terrifying twilight has taken the land by storm. This twilight is the product of the evil Twilight King Zant, whose shadow creatures begin wreaking havoc on the world. It's up to the blessed Link to save the day, but of course, it's not that simple. Early on, Link enters the darkness of the twilight and is temporarily transformed into a wolf. He also meets a strange character named Midna, a twilight being bent on driving the evil Zant from power. The story delivers on all counts, gripping the player to Hyrule and almost all of its NPCs like no other Zelda game before it. It's dark and twisted for Legend Of Zelda standards; and throughout the story you'll question everyone from Link to Midna to even Zelda herself.

Zelda games are all about adventure, and Twilight Princess gives the player a massive world to do all of the adventuring one could possibly want. The world is full of caves, towns, and dungeons to explore as well as lakes, forests, deserts, and mountains. The scope of the game is huge before even considering the hefty amount of things to do. Twilight Princess follows a very familiar Zelda structure, for the most part. Players are thrown into Link's world and eventually a conflict leads him towards a region's dungeon area, where Link will solve puzzles and defeat a boss character to restore peace throughout that region. This game does take the formula a little further; different regions throughout the world will be consumed by twilight throughout the game. Link must enter in his wolf form and seek tears of the region's inhabitants, which restores power to an overseeing guardian who drives away the twilight and restores the area. This extra factor in the gameplay really prolongs the game, but in a good way. Twilight Princess has a pace that never lets go of your attention but yields enough freedom to allow you to explore, which is the point in the first place.

Dungeons are a major highlight here, and the developers have mastered level design. Like the rest of the game, they follow a familiar pattern. Each dungeon introduces major challenges, new puzzles, and an important new item that will help you out with the former two situations. This structure has held strong since the series began in 1987, and it is rock-solid here as well. When you come across the bow in the second dungeon, for example, you're bound to use it a lot to solve the puzzles and open up some new areas as well as defeat the boss character. Zelda is very similar to another classic Nintendo franchise, Metroid, in that finding new items can really open up a lot elsewhere in the game. As I mentioned, exploring the world is a big deal in this game, and finding new stuff to uncover nooks and crannies is the trick to finding even more cool stuff.

The big controversy over the Nintendo Wii version of Twilight Princess was whether or not the controllers would be able to deliver familiar control mechanics so that Zelda fans wouldn't have to adjust much to a new scheme. Rest assured that Twilight Princess on the Nintendo Wii controls perfectly. That's really all there is to say about it, in general. It feels great, simply put. To go a bit more in-depth, though, you control Link's general movement with the nunchuck's analog stick. Unsheathing and swinging his sword is done with movements of the Wii remote, and for the spinning slash attack, the nunchuck. Z-targeting is back and works as well as it always has, and items can still be used and mapped to different buttons on the Wii remote. Using projectile items is a real treat; items like the slingshot, boomerang, and bow can be fired with the Wii's B trigger and aimed with the Wii remote's motion sensitivity as well as a targeting reticle on the screen. After some practice, defeating enemies, solving puzzles, and simply moving around is as easy as it ever was. Twilight Princess has as much of a learning curve as Ocarina Of Time did, and anyone who's played a Gamecube or Nintendo 64 Zelda game will have no trouble hacking and slashing through minion after minion, stopping only to scratch their head at the next befuddling puzzle or look at the scenery.

There are distractions everywhere that strongly support the rumored 70 hours of gameplay. Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess breaks a traditional Zelda mold by forcing you to find 5 Heart Pieces to restore a Heart Container (normally you'd collect four), and as a result, there are 45 of these pieces scattered throughout the world. Fishing was always fun on the Nintendo 64 Zelda titles, but it's an all-new experience here. With the Wii remote, you'll cast the fishing rod, set the hook, and reel in a fish rather than pressing buttons and moving analog sticks. There are 60 Poe souls and 24 Golden Bugs to seek as well as other mini-games scattered throughout Hyrule. If there's not enough for you to do here, well, I don't know what to tell you, because this game's loaded.

Twilight Princess is easily the best-looking Nintendo Wii title out of the gates. Hyrule has never looked so beautiful. Link's character model is detailed down to the chain mail protecting him underneath his tunic, and when you see the high towers of Hyrule Castle far off in the distance of the grassy rolling hills of Hyrule Field, it's hard to say the view isn't stunning. The character designs of the last few Zelda games have been superior to most games, but Twilight Princess takes it to a level so high that even those who don't normally appreciate such a thing as art style and design will be impressed. Enemy designs are some of the best in the series, and boss characters are more fearsome than ever before. The twilight structures enemies are very interesting, usually colored in a very dark palette with high-contrast, almost neon-colored designs covering them. Even the different weapons and items look interesting, and are much less conventional than those of previous games. The animation is smooth as silk. Link has no problem keeping up with your flinging of the Wii remote as you slash through keese and other familiar enemies. I was happy to see that some of Wind Waker's effects, like the exploding enemies and flashes of light during battle, were kept intact despite the otherwise polar opposite art direction. It also won't hurt to mention that the game's cut-scenes are choreographed beautifully, making for some of the best story clips I've seen in video games.

The music ranges from classic and memorable to completely new, but never leaves the high quality that you'd expect from a Zelda game. If there's anything as familiar as Link's green tunic, the Master Sword, or the Triforce, it's the different sound effects, jingles, and tunes that series veterans could hum in their sleep. You'll hear the familiar theme songs, that little tune that plays when you unlock a door or uncover a secret, and even the same jingle when you open up a treasure chest with an important item inside. There is still very little voice-over, with most of what's there coming from Midna's foreign twilight tongue. While most veterans of the Zelda franchise are happy with this, I would have liked to see other NPCs speak throughout the game. I wouldn't mind if Link remained his voiceless, wordless self, but everyone else could and should be talking.

After reading eight paragraphs of praise and little else, you might be wondering: Is Twilight Princess a perfect game? Sadly, it's not, though it's close. It's got a few flaws that keep it at a mortal status, though none of them are detrimental to the gameplay and are easily dealt with. First of all, the sole visual fault comes from slightly blurry textures that show that the game was intended to be a last-generation Gamecube game. Second, some of the alterations to small elements of gameplay bothered me a bit. For example, Link climbs at about half the speed he used to, making those all-too-common vine or grate climbs a major chore. Also, there are several lava, poison, and endless pits that will set you back-sometimes too far back. Early on in the game, you're to follow a monkey holding a lantern through an area filled with poison gas. If you get even an inch too far into the poison gas and away from the safety of the lantern, Link will pass out and return to the beginning of the area. The frustrating part in this specific example is that you battle enemies and can't control the speed of the monkey, so it's entirely possible to return to the starting point multiple times. Last of all, some of the twilight enemies-specifically the shadow minions that you'll encounter often as a wolf-are somewhat annoying to deal with. They present a definite challenge, but eventually they can become quite tiresome.

Even with those three gripes I mentioned above, Twilight Princess is a blast to play. It's tough to creatively elaborate on that; it's just fun, and that is the most important purpose of video games. Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an epic, and nothing less. It's a game that will test anyone, whether the player controlling Link with the Wii remote is a veteran or beginner. There is so much to do and so much to see that only the definition of time and meaning of life is more perplexing to think about. Nintendo couldn't have kicked off the Wii launch in a better way, but more importantly, they've one-upped a game that is considered by most as the greatest of all time. Ocarina Of Time, eat your heart out. There's a new legend, and it's Twilight Princess.",positive

3798,"Wow this game is the best game I've played on the XBOX! The graphics are great, the gameplay is great, and the controls are easy to remember! However this game is not for kids, with all of the gore, blood and the horseriders stabing a spear through you. The only bad part about this game is that it's very hard to bet. The bosses are totally cool. The bosses aren't the same the whole game, some are humans some are skeletons and all that. I have never played a ninja game where you have so much control over your charecter, you can decide when to kick and when to use your sword or whatever you have. Another bad thing is the camera veiw, if you walk into a corner and you press the R trigger the camera makes it hard to see and you can die alot from that. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR CAUAL GAMERS IT""S VERY, VERY HARD! But otherwise it's a all around great game!",negative
3799,"Four young girls in Salem have been acting strangely and the rumor is they've been afflicted by witchcraft. The governor of Massachusetts has sent Constable Hawthorne to investigate the rumors. Playing as Inspector Hawthorne, it is up to you to find the four girls, cure them, and find out why they were acting so strangely.

""Hidden Mysteries: Salem Secrets - Witch Trials of 1692"" is an excellent hidden object/puzzle game. Although it is not part of the Mystery Case Files series, it easily could be and it reminded me a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Case-Files-Return-to-Ravenhearst/dp/B001Q54VVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst</a>. The game is untimed and there is no penalty for clicking incorrectly - a plus in my mind. The creators of the game do a good job of creating an eerie Salem where residents are afraid of witchcraft. The graphics are good with a little animation although not much. There is a lot of revisiting places as hidden object games sometimes appear in locations where you've already been but it never gets annoying. There is a hint button if you need help finding hidden objects - the object will then be circled - you can also use that button to skip the mini-puzzles. The hidden objects are well hidden but never too difficult to find.

""Hidden Mysteries: Salem Secrets - Witch Trials of 1692"" has several nice features. There is a journal that helps move the story along - it is a good feature but doesn't offer many clues like journals do in some other hidden object games. As you play the hidden object games you gather things for your inventory - often you need to gather several items to assemble something (for example a fishing pole). There is a task list of things you need to do - this can be a bit daunting, especially when it lists things to do in locations you haven't visited or found yet. There is a map that comes in very handy - make sure you look at it often as it sometimes ""glows"" in locations where there is a hidden object game to be found (if you feel you can't go any further in the game that is the time to check the map as there is sure to be a hidden object game listed). My one wish is that the map was labeled with the names of the various locations (mine, school, tailor, etc.) as I spent a lot of time wandering around trying to find the location I needed to go to next. The mini-games have a red question mark in the left hand corner that explains what you need to do solve the puzzle - this comes in very handy. One feature I really appreciated was that when you clicked the right mouse button it showed you all the actions you could do in a scene - for example arrows show you what direction you can move in; a magnifying glass lets you know if there is an item you need to look at more closely; and a hand icon shows you if there is an item that needs to be picked up for your inventory. This was a handy little feature that I used throughout the game. While the entire game was a lot of fun with some good puzzles, I thought the ending of the game was a bit abrupt and a bit of a letdown although it does seem to leave room for a sequel.

""Hidden Mysteries: Salem Secrets - Witch Trials of 1692"" is one of the best hidden object/puzzles games I've played this year and I highly recommend it to people that like to play this type of game.",positive

3801,"There are many ""match three"" games out there right now but this is absolutely the best, most addictive game I've every played (and believe me, I've played A LOT OF THEM).

The game play starts out slow enough to allow you to get the hang of it, then speeds up as you progress ""down the Nile"" (a nifty way to tracking progress, better than just high scores.

Normally, once I've managed to get through an entire game like this, I delete it and go on to another game. But I can't get enough of this one.

3803,"Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is the sequel to the currently Japan-only Persona 2: Innocent Sin (and the earlier Revelations: Persona). My biggest gripe with the game is that constant references are made to the world of Innocent Sin -- however, by watching the included trailer and through the events of Eternal Punishment, you'll get a good idea of what happened in the earlier game.
With a somewhat contemporary setting, Eternal Punishment is an oddball in the world of RPGs. That doesn't mean, however, that it's bad! On the contrary, it's a superb game with deep gameplay. In battles, you can kill the demons, like in ordinary RPGs, or you can negotiate with them for money/items/information/tarot cards (the last of which is used to summon more Personae, facets of the user's personality which can be summoned to fight for them).
The characters are interesting and more adult than your typical spiky-haired teen heroes. They range from reporter Maya and policeman Katsuya to computer hacker/wiretapper Baofu and fashion model Ellen (from the first Persona). The innovative rumor system allows you to change the face of Sumaru City by spreading rumors. Want to buy weapons at your local bar? Spread the rumor that they are, and you can get a gun along with your martini.
My only other gripe, and it's small, is with the localization. Some of the text is a little stilted (Ulala's ""The goodness of a woman isn't in her bra!"" is a prime example). But considering the vast amount of text in this game -- and I mean VAST -- it's a very good localization overall, and in no way hinders your enjoyment of the game.
Atlus has hinted that they may release Innocent Sin if Eternal Punishment does well enough. If it's even half as good as its sequel, RPG fans around the world should rejoice.",positive

3813,"I know that some people may look at this review and think ""There are better headsets than the Pulses"" and ""Some headsets have better audiophiles"", but I am looking at this headset as an overall product. For only 80 dollars, you really can't do too much better than this.

The Pulse Headset comes with the following:

-Wireless Stereo Headset
-USB Adaptor
-Manual

Now at first, reading this, I thought that this would be a pain to set up. Boy was I wrong. As soon as you get it out of the box, all you need to do to activate the headset is plug in the USB adaptor and press a button on the headset. That's it. Then the headset is fully functional for your use and entertainment.

The ease of use was so surprising and amazing. Sony did a commendable job at making the headset incredibly easy to use right from the start.

After that, you get to the actual headset. For the price, the audiophiles are quite impressive. They are loud enough, have a great surround mix, and the tone is superb. The audio quality of voices when playing online is also quite good, if not slightly faint at sometimes. Fortunately, the headset allows you to not only change the volume, but the balance between in game volume and voice volume. So if, for some reason, you only want to hear your friends talking in game, you can do that. Or if you just want to hear the game, that is also an option. It is all very convenient and handy.

All in all, this is a fantastic headset for the price. It's easy to use, has excellent quality, and not to mention a pretty good 5-6 hour battery life (and it charges off of a standard USB, which is very convenient). If you own a PS3 and want a quality headset for a reasonable price, the Pulse Wireless Stereo Headset is the perfect purchase.",positive
3814,"Great controller, much cheaper than buying it from the retail stores.",negative
3815,"Great headphones for the price!

**Please note that I do lots of gaming with these headphones

UPDATE:  The durability and build quality of these phones are absolutely fabulous.  Razer did not spare any quality when it comes to build.  These things are sturdy and feel sturdy, unlike my Sony Pulse headset I use on my PS4.  (These are for my PC)

Pros:
-Great comfort and portability due to the folding earcups
-Great sound quality, the surround sound is fantastic.  Bass is very dark.
-Nice design
-Microphone excellent
-PS4 compatible (good for me because I have a PS4)
-Easy to use
-Razer Synapse 2.0 includes many great customization options
-Light up logo adds a cool new look
-Retractable microphone is very convenient

Cons:
-Some very high pitches do not sound as good as lower, but EXTREMELY unnoticeable unless looking for it.
-Only USB so you cannot listen to music through an iPod or similar device with these.

Verdict:

Great pair of headphones! You are not going to find better than these unless you triple your price range.",positive

3817,"I've owned this game since 1998 and have recently started playing it again.  This is one of those must-have games to download onto your Wii U.

The premise starts out with 3 young friends that are treasure hunting.  The Boy (we'll call him Josh, since it's my name) falls into a lake and searches for his way back to Potos Village.  He finds a sword along the way, and it calls out to him.  Josh easily manages to pull the sword.  However, when he returns home, the village Elder is extremely upset and berates Josh.  Even worse, his friend Elliott gets swallowed into a hole, which contains a huge monster!  So Josh has to use his newfound sword to slay the beast!

However, after Josh wins, he doesn't even get a thank you from the villagers.  Instead, they actually BLAME him for what happened by allowing the beasts to take over the world!  Immediately, the Elder permanently banishes Josh from Potos.  :(  So now he has to set off to restore the 8 Mana Seeds which are strewn inside various palaces.  Josh also finds 2 other friends along the way, a girl and a Sprite (it's too hard to tell if it's male or female).

Just like The Legend Of Zelda series, you will battle in live, real-time.  Josh and his friends will acquire 8 weapons: the glove, axe, bow, whip, sword, boomerang, spear, and javelin.  ALL of them will eventually need to be upgraded by Watts the blacksmith.  However, you can't do that without first finding the 32 Weapon Orbs (you can actually upgrade the weapons all the way to Level 9).  Some of them are contained inside treasure chests, some you will get from talking to other characters, or you can also obtain them from defeating bosses.  Please keep in mind to practice with all of your weapons while battling enemies so that your characters become even stronger!

A couple of important other notes:  once the girl and the Sprite gain the power of Mana magic, they can also build up the 8 elementals to Level 8.  The following magic is from Undine, Salamando, Gnome, Sylphid, Shade, Lumina, Luna and Dryad.  Experiment with each magical power to see how it affects the various enemies.  And be sure to use the girl's Analysis magic on the Crystal Orbs -- you need the correct magic in order to open secret passages so that you can progress further into the game.

Halfway through the game, Josh and his friends will gain the use of Flammie, a White Dragon that can take you to otherwise unreachable towns and eventually the Mana Fortress.  And, as with all storylines, there's lots of drama and betrayal involved.  Seriously, you really need to play this game:  the candy coated graphics, enemies, and some of the best lush, relaxed music should be enough to get your attention.  :)

Also, please be sure to pick up Secret Of Evermore (Super NES), Sword of Mana (Game Boy Advance), and Children Of Mana (Nintendo DS).",negative

Displays at 30/40 frame rates resolution, (depending on your set-up) makes this new game absolutely mind blowing and worth the money! With tons of side missions, side quests, and challenges, to include a comprehensive storyline,  this game has well over 100 hours of game play. The Map is very large and easy to understand, HUD and game navigation's are very clean, with a comprehensive story-line to follow. Fast travel is available.

Though there were segments of the first two discs that I found tedious, I have never played a JRPG that didn't have boring grind sessions in the first 2/3s. If you ignore the ""Final Fantasy"" branding, and hence stop comparing it to other titles in the series, this is an excellent game. When you hit the last disc, the game really blossoms into something incredible: amazing graphics, decent monster variety, a large world to explore, a deep item and weapon upgrading system, and 56 missions that will test your tactics and quick thinking. While it may not have been one of the best games I've ever played, it was certainly one of the most enjoyable. Easily the best Square/Enix RPG on the Xbox.",positive

3835,"The original Witcher was a great game, whereas the sequel was even better, bigger and more beautiful in every aspect. Following on this trend of building upon and improving their achievements, CD PROJEKT RED, the small Polish developer that has been humbling gaming behemoths for years, released their best game yet. And what a game this is!

THE BEST VIRTUAL WORLD I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
Yes, the world of THE WITCHER III is huge, far larger than SKYRIM. Far more importantly though, it feels more real and it is full of life.
The game throws you in a world of unparalleled beauty with details that keep unfolding the closer you observe it. Every spade of grass and every pebble looks real and obeys the laws of physics as set by the new REDengine. From the night and day and weather cycles to gear that gets damaged and needs to be repaired by blacksmiths and from growing facial hair to NPCs with real lives, the world of The Witcher absorbs you in and never, ever lets you go. The flames of Igni feel absolutely real as do bodies of water. Beasts and humans will do the unexpected whereas the skies sheltering your travels are absolutely mesmerizing. One can easily spend hours in the game simply observing the gorgeous world around him.
There are some concessions to absolute realism one can take advantage off (quick traveling and in-battle repairs for example); however, purists can ignore them and sink in the extra hours to go old school.
Now, all these come at a price. A couple of weeks ago, I made sure to upgrade to a nVidia 960 (pouring with a brand new 352.86 driver) and 12GB of RAM just for this game (at some point, CD PROJEKT has to ask ASUS for dividends!) and the game runs smoothly at Ultra.
(Also, no save-files crashes this time around. So far).

AN EPIC SCORE FOR AN EPIC STORY
Once more, the music is an essential part of both the atmosphere and the gaming experience. The composers are different than those of the previous games and this translates into a novel approach to the world of Geralt of Rivia. You will recognize a number of variations on themes from the previous games and it feels like meeting old friends, matured yet still dear to you; however, I found the music more subtle and effective and not less powerful.

CHOOSE YOUR WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION
Remember the days form the very first Witcher when you basically finished the game with the same sword and kept saving every last oren to buy the 5,000O leather jacket? Well, Geralt not only yields an extra crossbow but he also enjoys an ever growing choice of armor and weapons. Combine this with a huge library of books and an endless supply of potion and bombs ingredients and you will soon find your hero to be overburdened. And then you realize that there is no storage chest! Not to worry, the game now employes Roach's saddlebag (buy it as soon as possible and enlarged it). This way your storage is always close by. And, take my advice, do NOT sell anything! From ingredients to older swords, you will need them for crafting. And even find loot is abundant, it always feel great to gather all the ingredients to finally forge a sword or a piece of armor whose schematics you had been carrying for some time.

IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROLLING THE WORLD AROUND YOU
Some people have been complaining about the PC controls and, up to a point, I can understand why. As with all games, I remap almost everything so that I am able to use only the right end of the keyboard (arrows for movement are default here but I use the Num-keys 1-5 to select my Sign, Num-0 to use it, / for the steel sword, * for the silver one, and so on). The game is enjoyable when set at the highest difficulty one can survive at so having quickly accessible controls are essential. That is why I hope to see a key-rebinding option Menu soon and not have to dive in the input.settings file.

WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!",positive
3836,"Prepare yourself for this game. It's unbelievable. The graphics are the best I've EVER seen on any video game and the game stays extremely close to the story line of not only the Two Towers but incorporates part of the first movie as well.
Its play is wonderful -- from the easy levels that prohibits frustration with new game players so that they're not killed off in two seconds into the game (thereby chucking the game across the room and never playing it again) -- to more challenging or expert levels for the advanced game player.
It seems one of the great advantages of the XBOX is its processor and this game takes full advantage of that. Seamless movies interspersed with game play creates a game that is truly a story-telling adventure. You feel immediately immersed into the game and the ""interruptions"" of movie clips don't seem invasive.

You can use the wireless dongle (sold separately) for Windows and it will work, but I just use a short 3 foot micro-usb cable (purchased separately) in that case. Works great with Steam.

Gameplay 9
Story 7
Characters 8
Illusion of choice 10
Replay 8

Interactive horror story. I screamed several times and had many more jumps. I'm easy to get. I scream at almost every horror movie. I screamed once during Super 8. I screamed when the Hulk roared at Iron Man in Avengers. UD got me a bunch of times, but I'm easy to get.

In terms of who dies and in what order, there are millions of permutations. In that sense there are millions of endings. You effect how relationships develop and what the characters discover. This directly effects dialogue. So in that sense you can carve your own path. However, all the story events, including the end, will happen. You only effect who is alive for them and some of their dialogue. In that sense the story is linear and you have no control.

The story is very cliche and unoriginal. But, hey, the last original teen slasher was the first ""Scream"" over a decade ago. The characters are basically archetypes too and you don't learn any of their backstory. The acting is so good, none of that matters. Each character was brought to life by the actor. The actors made me care about each person.

I really enjoyed the gameplay. Not quite Heavy Rain but the closest. Possibly the best use of motion control ever. When a character is hiding, if you move the controller a tiny little bit, he/she will be found! However, most of the quick time events are easy. I failed maybe two of them. I chose to use the motion sensor to aim. Aiming with the controller itself was fun. Made most of the shots, but some were too tight or not enough time.

I've played through once, blindly. Took about 10 hours. After finishing you can replay scenes. I spent about 5 hours replaying different scenes to see what some of the outcome could be. I plan to do a full replay keeping everybody alive and a half replay killing everybody. Then I'll shelve it for awhile and come back to it after I've forgotten some.

3858,"I didn't give this game five stars because of it's mediocre graphics, its linear game play or its redundant controls.  I gave Tron five stars because it impressed me very unexpectedly, the online multiplayer for this game is just plain FUN. You can play all the call of duty you want, but you will find derezzing someone on the Grid brings an unusual amount of satisfaction. I tend to get bored with games fairly quickly, especially online multiplayer, I played this game for three days and hardly put it down.  I have complaints about this game, it seems like it was thrown together for the movie, but I can't help but hope they come out with another game and put some serious effort into it.",negative
3859,"This is a true rpg masterwork.  You can fully customize your character (race, alignment, class, gender, abilities, etc..) and equip him/her with all sorts of weapons, armor and spells.  The game is in top-down view, giving the player the ability to see everything around.  One of the greatest aspects of the game is the freedom you have.  You can be heroic and go good deeds and commit no crimes, or you can be downright evil and break down people's doors, kill the inhabitants, and rob them of their meager gold and things.  The game will become harder if you choose the latter path, as your reputation becomes horrible and merchants will charge you much more for goods, and the guards will constantly be after you.  Also, if you have clashing alignments in your adventuring party, they will always insult, and sometimes try to kill each other.
The most difficult aspect of the game is gaining experience and making your party stronger.  Eventually (years of real-time playing) you can create a character and a party that can slay dragons, instead of being killed by lowly monsters like Gibberlings and Hobgoblins.  Overall an excellent game.",negative

3893,"Not many people have heard about this game. I know I didn't up until a couple of years ago. I didn't even think twice about the SEGA Saturn being much of a system to be recognized... until I found this.

First off, the bad: because this game was made over ten years ago, the graphics are... well, ""ugly"" is a nice way of putting it. It's not the worst I've seen, but certainly not the best. Once you get past the eye-sore that the graphics could be for you, then there's the combat mechanics, which are rather tricky to get used to at first, especially with the regular controller. I would highly suggest getting a ""3D"" controller for this game, because it practically demands it. Finally, many of the characters just don't have a lot of growth, save for the main cast.

That all said, the good heavily outweighs the bad. For starters, the story: the fact that, for an RPG that only goes for 22 hours max (and that's assuming you get really, badly stuck), the storyline and the characters are all phenomenal, and even somewhat human! A bit clich, granted, but not horribly so. You truly feel connected to your character in this world. Even your sworn enemy ends up becoming a character that one can sympathize with. Next, I mentioned that the combat controls are a bit tricky to get used to... however, once you get them down, it's mostly a matter of being at the right place at the right time. Sometimes, it almost makes boss battles a little too easy, but never loses its fun factor.

Finally, the flow is absolutely spot-on. There's no seeking out items for long hours on end, no hidden ""good"" endings that must be unlocked by doing a certain little dance, no nearly-impossible battles where you needed a single item that you had to get back in the second area of the game, and can't get now. And although there is a bit of backtracking, each time you go back, there's more to be found - much like the Metroid game. Everything flows together very nicely.

So in conclusion, yes, I would recommend this to anyone willing to pay the money. It's a fun game with decent pacing that is a vast departure from it's peers - and still manages to be one of the best I've ever experienced.",neutral

3896,"Based on the old, excellently performing Xbox S-controller with added bumpers in place of black/white buttons. Thankfully they dumped the large ""Duke"" controller altogether. This controller can turn on/off the 360 remotely, act as a remote, works on a PC, connects to a headset, etc... It rumbles -- the $600 PS3 doesn't. It connects FLAWLESSLY. Never fails to connect and the connection never drops, ever, even though it's wireless. Battery life is extremely LONG - you'll be able to use the thing forever without recharging. Attachements exist for charge & play, Accessories for quick charge. Options for regular or rechargable batteries.

Having an excellently designed controller is key.

Removing the white/black buttons, so your right hand can rest in a position with your left hand -- both wrapping around the ""stalks"" of the controller, was a good decision in my opinion. It might take some people some time to get used to the bumpers. They are placed in a location where you might have previously rested your right and left index fingers when not pulling the trigger.

3rd party wireless controllers for the original xbox SUCKED! The connection dropped, they would malfunction, or else worked okay but were not rechargable (Logitech). Everything about this 360 controller is right!",positive
3897,"The Nyko Zoom for Kinect abrogrates many of the Kinect's worst problems. Install was a snap (literally). Kinect games are now more fun to play. The product is so successful, Microsoft should have built a Zoom lens option into the original Kinect unit.

Pity my poor children. The current form of motion gaming requires players to stand within a small 2 foot by 2 foot box. Stray too far forward and you become an undetectable blur. Stray too far back and you bump into the couch. The motion controlled menus are an exercise in anger management, and worse, kid sized hands appear to be too small for the Kinect sensor to recognize. And then the Kinect sensor's web support page explains the 40 inch height minimum to play connect. Take that, 4 year olds!

How many households keep their couch more than 8 feet from their TVs? When I was shopping for an HDTV, I referenced a chart showing the best viewing distances for each size of HDTV. Now, if you have a 60 inch or larger HDTV, then you probably want to situate your couch more than 8 feet from the screen. If you have a 46 inch HDTV (which is the median size for an HDTV at this time), you probably want to situate your couch about 6 feet from the screen. Then, of course, there is the issue of the average living room size. In small houses, an average living room is as small as 12 x 12. If the audio/video cabinet sticks out about two feet and the couch sticks out another 3 feet, you have only a maximum of seven feet of distance between the Kinect sensor and you.

My house faces both the best viewing distance from the HDTV issue and the room size issue. Our rectangular living room has enough space for us to re-orient our TV and our couch (and pretty much everything else) solely to accommodate the Kinect sensor. The re-orienting your entire space solution has a serious drawback: you either loose the best viewing distance to your HDTV or you have to buy a much larger HDTV. To many, this is a great solution. Who doesn't want a larger TV? But then again, spending an extra $1000 for Kinect gaming seems excessive. For that kind of money, I could send my kids to the local gymnastics place to keep them physically active. Re-orienting our living room and buying a new HDTV is not to solution for my family.

The Nyko Zoom solves the room size and viewing distance problem by tricking the Kinect sensor into believing your living room is larger than it really is. Rather than a zoom lens, the Nyko Zoom has a wide angle lens. Objects close to the Kinect with the Nyko Zoom looked appropriately curved. FYI, TV shows also use wide angle lenses. This makes everyone look wider (the proverbial 10 pounds you put on when on television) and makes the sets look bigger. (If you ever tour a TV set, you will immediately notice how tiny they really are). The Nyko Zoom makes your living room look bigger. For us, games like Kinect Sports detected us in the ""best"" zone rather than the ""good"" zone. Two player games are now playable, as the wide angle lens gives players a wider space to play in. No more 2 foot by 2 foot box for my kids. Considering all the frustration and crying (yes, my kids shed real tears over how awful the Kinect can be) the Nyko Zoom lens should have come standard with the Kinect. (I gave the Kinect a low score because of how badly it works with real kids in real living rooms). My advice: if you have a Kinect, buy a Nyko Zoom lens, and if you are thinking of buying a connect, buy it with the Nyko Zoom lens.",neutral
3898,"We've had the Wii since 2006 and have loved every minute of it. We have never expereinced any problems or malfunctions with it.

There is such a wide array of games available for it and you can download games right from the console as long as it is hoked up to the internet. You are gauranteed to find games that everyone will like.

There are alot of games available for exercise and movement in general, so the kids aren't just sitting there staring at the screen like a zombie.

We still have the original Wiimotes and nunchuk that came with it (as well as some extras we bought) and they are still going strong.

It was a great investment and has proven to be reliable, durable and fun for the whole family.

You can even go online right on your tv via the Wii, as long as you are connected to the internet. My youngest enjoyed this feature before she got her laptop.

I definitely recommend the Wii if you are looking for a more family focused console, a console for younger kids and/or to grow with them.",positive
3899,"No spoilers :)

I beat the game last night on normal difficulty.  I'm not one for long reviews, so here's my two cents.

Pros:
-Excellent voice acting
-Cinematography was stunning.  I found myself stopping and just looking around.
-Fun vigors/weapons/gear to experiment with.
-Some challenging fights
-Sky rail system was a lot of fun
-Music/atmosphere is fantastic.
-Dynamic enemies/fights.

Cons:
-Story was a bit hard to follow, maybe that was just me.
-""Choices"" you make to not impact the ending (as far as I know).  Replay value resides in the fun and different use of gear/vigors/weapons.  There were many I favored over others that I didn't really give a fair chance.

Those are the main points that stuck out for me.  I plan on playing through the game again.

Cheers.

UPDATE 12/31/13:
Played the game through again on my PC, on hard this time (thanks Steam sale!). and it really hit me that this game is probably one of my favorites at this point.  I STILL find myself just stopping and looking around at the details, floating segments, colors, clouds, storms, etc.  I just cannot get enough of this game!  The additional play through really nailed down the plot/story which is fairly complex, in my opinion.  I certainly look forward to enjoying the DLC and additional Bioshock installments.  Just had to share my increased love for this game.",positive

I received the game once and it didn't work. So, I sent it back and talked to the seller who agreed to send me a refund unless he found a new copy. He then told me a found one and sent it to me. It's been over 2 months now and I still have not received the game. I contacted the seller again and told him and he has only apologized that it never reached me but says he can't do anything about it.

3912,"You dive and you dive searching the beautifully created Titanic wreck for hidden objects. And it's not all that easy! Some of the objects are very tiny and the clues are deliberately misleading: for instance is ""bass"" a fish or a string instrument? Is a ""bat"" a flying creature or a baseball bat?  A ""sand clock"" fooled me for a long time, but it shouldn't have. That was an hour glass. The graphics are really marvelous, and will more or less suck you in. The Grand Staircase scene certainly is based on the actual Grand Staircase, as it is easily recognizable. You'll marvel at the intricacy of the library, deck and staterooms all in huge disarray with beautiful tropical fish floating by to distract you.

One reviewer complained that if you use the hints option and click too often on the wrong thing, you are penalized by losing valuable time and all the operations are timed. But that's part of the fun! You have to look sharp and work quickly or you run out of time and are obliged to repeat that particular dive. Each repeat brings up a different stable of objects to find and there are literally hundreds.

The mini-games aren't all that easy, either. You have to piece together old photographs with big tears and water stains and again you have to be quick! The final mini-game requires you to find the long combination of a safe containing a king's crown.. this took me three tries but I finally did it and I was pleased with myself!

If you like hidden object puzzles and  enjoy a bit of history (lots of facts about the Titanic are dished out to you as you go along) and love beautiful graphics, this is the game for you. It's perfect for older kids, too, and believe me, you're all going to learn something one way or another! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",positive

3914,"My husband and I had gotten the Super Nintendo Mario World game back in the 1980's.  We were both so addicted to it we ended up getting what we referred to as ""Nintendo Thumb"".  Everyone would have a good chuckle as I swung my controller around trying to get Mario over the crevices.

Since then, I have tried to play some of the games that we have gotten for the kids.  Some of them I have been able to limp through and some of them just make me seasick.  We got this for Christmas with the Wii and my daughter who is 13 and I are having such a blast playing this.  I was Luigi and she was Mario, she is still a lot better than I will ever be.  We found out that she was able to ""eat"" my Luigi with her Yoshi character and spit Luigi back out again. So she said to me that she would pick me up with Yoshi when I was having a tough time and carry me through.

Why is it so good? FPS DM/CtF type games are a proven winner, this one takes it to the next level. Speaking of levels, you'll find plenty in this one- enough to keep you busy for quite a while.
Something that made the first UT so good are the people out there who write mods for the game- you will find such people for UT2K3 as well, these provide you with some very interesting changes in the game; assuring that you will not get tired of Unreal Tournament 2003 for quite a few days (months? years? milleniums?)
Overall, this game was done *perfectly* in my sight- the ai and weaponrly seems balanced, there is just nothing i could think of that would make the game any better. If i could give it 6 stars I would. Enjoy Unreal Tournament 2003 - it's money you won't regret spending.",positive

The story rolls along nicely and sweetly. Kratos has a calling set forth by an upstart Viking god, so he storms up a mountain to hash it out. The violence of combat is interspersed with moments of silence and bitterness between him and his son. You explore a vast territory packed with menacing enemies (all delightfully different), gods, support characters, and bosses. The script is A-grade for a videogame. It's like watchign a well made movie.

But the graphics...Oh, man. Buckle up and let your jaw drop, hit the ground, fly up and drop again. Simply stunning. The developers ran wild with the colors, maps and textures. I took moments to drink it all in and was so impressed and happy that the developers put so much into this. It's a brilliant gem, polished and set high on a king's crown. (Ok, maybe I'm overselling it.)

Bottom line: If you want to be dazzle by what will probably be the best graphics awarded game for the PS4 this year, including an excellent story and gameplay, then grab this bad boy. You'll be honoring the gods with your purchase!",positive
3937,The system itself is the best system in all of GBA history.  I ended up buying one out of a fit of nostalgia.,negative
3938,"I had so much fun playing this game! I only wish I got it for the ps3 rather than PC (I'm just more used to gaming on there). For the guy on here who whines about the $20 price tag...i got mine from a major retailer for ten bucks on sale so just shop around. It's your own fault for paying full price for something.
Anyways - the game is well worth 10 or 20 bucks. I had hours of enjoyment and you really need to think ""outside of your brain"" for this game.
You experience enter & exit portals. soon you get a gun where you can create either of the two. You just have to see how the two react to you going through and then later in the game velocity and momentum play a role in it as well. I know my description might not be the greatest but it really gets your mind thinking about how to get to the otherside of the room which mostly seems impossible. Tons of fun - especially the computer GlaDos system that mocks you the entire way. Laugh out loud funny lines especially towards the end. I had tons of fun and for that same guy who whines about the length - there are many advanced levels you can unlock after you solve the initial game and online ther are many DIY portal dimensions you can do that people have posted themselves.
I can't wait to play it again! Level 15 sure had me stumped for awhile :)",positive
3939,"As a longtime fan of survival horror, ""Alien: Isolation"" is the best game of the genre since the first ""Resident Evil"". A times terrifying, but always creepy, ""Alien: Isolation"" is simply a fun game to play.

The game's timeframe takes place between the first and second films in the series, and you are playing as Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda. You've traveled to deep space in search of any information about what happened to your mother. The entire set-up is to get you on board the space station Sevastopol which currently has an Alien stalking it's corridors. You are given a series of tasks to complete, and using your brains and stealth you must move around the ship without drawing the Alien's attention, and you must avoid the murderous androids which are running Sevastopol on ""the company's"" orders....and throw in a few terrified survivors that will kill anyone and everything the encounter.

This is not a ""run & gun"" type game. If you are looking for a shoot 'em up style game, pick up ""Colonial Marines"". ""Isolation"" is all about creeping around, solving puzzles and avoiding confrontation. You will find some weapons scattered through the game, and you will also be able to craft some items to use on your journey, but like the best survival horror games, your resources are very limited, so be careful how you use them.

To get the maximum scare effect from this game, I also recommend you pick up a good set of headphones. ""Alien: Isolation"" uses sound to really set the mood and tone of the game, and nothing will raise the goosebumps quicker than hearing ""something"" in the vents above your head, or a door opening behind you.",positive

3943,"My daughter played Club Penguin for a while, so she got this game this game at GameStop one day, when she still liked CP. She got stuck, so she didn't play for a long time. But one day, even though she doesn't like CP anymore, she was playing her DSi, and an hour or two later, she ran in excitedly, saying ""I beat Club Penguin on my DS!"" Also, it is short, but apparently it was very fun anyway. You can upload your coins to your online account, and download a 14th mission, but for us it didn't work. Also, usually my daughter doesn't play her DS unless she's playing with her cousin (who also has a DSi) so the game must have been really interesting. Plus she doesn't even like CP much anymore, so anyone who wants a pretty easy secret agent missions game should get it, along with CP fans.

Overall, pretty good.",positive
3944,"The more realistic moves, skating, and fighting brings this new version to the next level. Totally awesome. I do not buy into all the extras anymore, however; if you do, be ready to lay out lots of extra $$$'s to keep you on top if playing games online.

3948,"Not sure what all the problems with bad connectors or wires after a month is about. There's no pins so the few saying something about pins I have to question. I have my run to a shelf which I use to charge my controller and when not in use I curve it and put a cigar box under it to hold the connector up. Anyway, all these bad reviews for whatever reason/s, Perhaps there was a bad batch or misuse/abuse if in fact these are the cables people who are reviewing them bought. Of course if it wasn't from amazon I'm sure there's counterfeits out there. Can't even buy a PS3 controller w/o using caution anymore.

I purchased the duo pack last year and it's working completely fine. Figured I'd pay a few more bucks to get two and gift one to a friend since he needed a longer cable & I needed one for long nights using the headset. I'm charging my controller daily, sometimes two controllers daily and this cable has held up completely fine. Plus the headset countless nights playing Destiny from wake till bedtime.

As for the cable, well it's a USB cable, nothing much to say other than it's what one should expect and works great.",negative

These are just some of the best that jumped out at me. Don't get me wrong, I love the nostalgia of the old Nintendo franchises but this thing has serious horsepower and has tons of free games through PS Plus. Once the PS4 is released the Vita will have even more funtionality and you only need one PS Plus subscription (can be used on the Vita, PS3 and PS4 at the same time).

Basically if you've been on the fence now is the time to buy. Not only is it great value with great games and future PS4 features, the more people that buy the Vita, the more great games will be developed in the future.",neutral

3954,"I bought the game digitally through Nintendo, and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Both Birthright and Conquest are fun to play (I own both) with the conquest path being the more fun of the two. This is primarily because of the harder difficulty through XP, gold, and objective restrictions. It means you have less resources to do more things than in Birthright. However, Birthright is no pushover, it's just a different experience. The easiness in Birthright is in the ability to grind out indefinitely until your troops have no challenge at all, or so in theory. I have not tried Revelations out yet, but don't be fooled by its $20 price, like Conquest and Birthright (the price when you buy one is halved for the other) it is another story. People bitch and moan about it, but personally I like the complexity and battle of both games, and the reviews of Revelations made me that much more confident in the future of the games. I have poured approximately 30 hours into both games so far, and have loved all of it. The customization is not as much as I like, but certainly more than it was in Awakening, and the classes are interesting. I was skeptical in the beginning, but now I am thoroughly enjoying myself. The story is different depending on the side you choose, and much more dramatically than that of a Pokemon game. Do not buy both physically or digitally. Buy one, and then after chapter 6 buy the other at half off through Nintendo in game. The game isn't perfect, but it will give you plenty of enjoyment, and has plenty of repeatability for newer fans like myself (Awakening was the first one for me) and older ones too. Don't be swayed by the apparent difficulty, you can easily learn as you play. Throwing weapons lower stats and make it easier to take down a target. Bows are stronger, but have limitations to fire up close, and don't lower stats. There is an entire weapon triangle. Overall it is an amazing set of games, and you will enjoy your investment.",positive

3962,"This is my first Sim game, and I love it.  There are three modes to play in:  in God Mode, you terraform the region, adding cliffs or valleys, flattening shores, planting forests, etc; in Mayor mode, you will zone areas, add utilities and services, and receive input from dozens of informative graphs, data and advisors; in MySim mode you can create individuals and then name them, give them a place to live and a car to drive, etc.

You can run your simulation in three speeds, and there are hundreds of items and options for you to use -- bridges, stadia, landmarks, parks, schools, monorails, industry, agriculture, museums and many more.

There are also several tutorials that show you how to get started, make money, develop a big city, or use the included Rush Hour expansion pack, which lets you get in the driver's seat of buses, garbage trucks, traffic helicopters, ferry boats, --any vehicle that is operating in your city!  Just be careful -- it is EASY to spend hours and hours building your city with as much complexity as you care for.  Excellent game, implemented very well.

I am currently stuck in a part of this game i can't figure out but even thats not enough for me to be able to knock this game in any way. This in my opinion is the best game ever made for a home console to date. It seems easy on the first level but as you go on it becomes very challenging. The combos you use to finish off the stronger characters were a nice touch. Make no mistake about it this game is meant for adults. There is swearing,and it shows some nudity (womens' breasts) not to mention more gore than most games out there. If you are looking for a good game for you or an older teen son you have to give this game a look,theres a few minor annoyances like camera angles and the screen looking gittery at times but the game is incredible and i have only seen a loading sequence come up very rarely and ony lasting like 5 seconds when it does,i almost forget i am playing a disc system with the short loading times,you'd think you were playing a cartridge conssole with this game. The graphics rival anything the Xbox can do,to sum it up you have to see this game to believe it. One of very few games that actually got a lot of hype and then lived up to that hype. Onelast thing i should mention is that even when there was alot of action on the screen and battles with multiple enemies i saw very little sign of slowdown if any at all.from the first boss battle with the Hydra i think anyone who plays this game will be hooked till the end (or till they get stuck on a puzzle like me lol).",positive

3972,"I didn't even know Arcana Heart existed and I'm sure that a lot of other people don't as well. I learned of this game on a game review website. The review critic there went into enough detail that made me want to give them game a try. I must say that was probably one of the best gaming decision I made in a long time.

Arcana Heart is an unbelievably fantastic game. I mean it is simply awesome! This game is everything that a 2D fighter game should be and then some.

Just to get the obvious out the way YES! this game features a mildly sexually suggestive theme of teenage and some pre teenage girls fighting each other in one on one combat. To be honest the sexual undertone is more cutesy than sexy, than some games/animes such as Ikki-Tousen (a great anime btw) where there is strong sexual implications. No one is wearing a skimpy outfit really and all of their clothes stay on except for Heart who loses her shoe, and Mildred who's a bit top heavy...oh and that android chick. Otherwise the sexual nature of the game is more on the humorous side.

Now the game itself... this is what the real kicker is. Despite what may have been a cheesy selling point like most all female cast fighting games. The fact that this game even has jiggling D cups, isn't a distraction thrown into the game just to cover up shabby game play. No! the designers of Arcana Heart knew what they were doing. They were making a serious fighting game, and those jiggling D cups are just ""extra"" icing on the cake.

This game is by no means meant not to be taken seriously. This is a serious fighting game. Right up there with Street Fighter 2, Marvel Super Heroes, and Marvel Vs. Capcom. This game is a spectacular fighting game. You don't just jump into battle and mash buttons. You need to know the moves and know your character to win in this game. uniquely you can customize your characters special ability by syncing them with different arcane gods. This changes your characters specials and adds serious replay ability to the characters. If your like me you got tired of Ryu's Hadoken the 9,999th time you saw it since the early 90's. In Arcana Heart you don't have to worry about being bored of the same specials, you can change them out anytime you'd like.

Fighting...is one of the more unique aspects of Arcana Heart. You have the ability to do some serious combo moves that can literally take your opponent from the ground to the air. I'm still getting the hang of combo's so again this game does take time to master. The controls are pretty straightforward. I used an arcade stick first and just went back to a controller. It's up to you and what you like, but some characters have pretty simple specials, and some very technical. The only complaint I have is that the manual never says Square, circle, X, or triangle. It just call them weak attack, strong attack, med attack, etc. and A,B,C. You have to kind of figure out which is which. If your like me and have been gaming for a long time when you see A,B,C, you can easily forget your holding a PS2 controller. Once you get over that set back and learn which button is which the game really takes off.

All the characters have unique traits and fighting abilities. All of their arcana's either match their personalities or back stories. What's cool about Arcana though is that the fighters are young girls so they play with that idea a lot. Lilica uses her roller blades as a weapon, Lieselotte uses a creepy puppet, Kira who is only 11 has uses a globe of water to fight and wears a bathing suit (neat idea). So there are quite a few unique characteristics thrown in for each of the girls. I can say that the characters in Arcana Heart aren't necessarily aimed at mocking other fighting characters, they are more aimed at being clich's of anime characters.  So if you watch anime you probably will see plenty of similarities.

Gameplay is where Arcana Heart is strongest. It's a serious fighting game wrapped in a cute package, but if you don't realize that when you get to Mildred the final boss you probably should stick to playing Shaq Fu. Because believe me Mildred will make you shatter controllers when you face her. She's more than just another SNK boss, she is invincible! She is the hardest boss I've ever faced in a fighting game and when you get to her you will see why. Some how, even though drives you to the point of insane rage, at the same time she arouses you (strong pun) to keep on playing. I don't think I've been defeated by a more voluptuous boss.

Overall Arcana Heart is an awesome fighting game, it is worth buying if your into 2D fighting games, and no being on PS2 doesn't make a difference at all graphically. The beauty of a 2D fighter is its simplicity. Most 3d fighting games today are all glamour and no play. This 2D fighter meets and exceeds expectations. You can pass it up, but your only missing out. The only problem that I had with Arcana Heart is that there was no ""Turbo"" option on game play. The ability to speed up battle would have made this A+ game an A+ + game! But this game is def a keeper!

Oh yeah! And Saki all the way!",positive
3973,"This game is in a way a tiny bit like Paper Mario only because of the battle modes. If you liked Paper Mario you are bound to be hooked to this game like I was.
The story goes like this:
The Good Will Embasadore from the Beanbean Kingdem has just arrived and wishes to improve her kingdom's ties with the Mushromm Kingdom. But instead has stolen Princess Peach's beautiful voice and replaced it with explosive vocabulary! Wait...that was no Good Will Embasadore...that was the evil witch, Cackletta!
Now it's up to you, Mario & Luigi, to get Princess Peach's voice back and stop Cackletta from anymore destuction.
This isn't just another GBA game! It's not just follow a path left to right! You get to explore the beautiful Beanbean landscape as you travel from places like Hoohoo Town home of the Hoohoolagins to Woohoo Hooniversity and lots more places too!
Nintendo has managed to put some humor into this great game too! So you won't be just blistering up your fungers from playing too much, you'll be laughing your head off!
This is a fantastic game that any Nintendo fan shouldn't miss! Even if you aren't a Nintendo fan you should still get this game!",positive

For this... thank you.",neutral
3975,"This game took me by surprise, it is very easy to give this game a 5 out of 5.

I have to add that I never played the first one and so when I saw this one I was skeptical at first. I mean I heard it was great, and my friends said it was great, but I was thinking ""meh, how good can it be."" By nature I am a big xbox guy, so after watching some video reviews online I decided to add this to my collection of 3 ps3 games (little big planet, killzone 2, and infamous), and I have to say I am very glad I did. This game is awesome and I would recommend it for gamers of all types (sports, action, rpg, etc) regardless of age (not too young).

The multiplayer is put together really well and it is worth it alone just for that, but the single player is the real gem.  The graphics and sound are amazing and enhance the experience as you travel all over in this game. This is the first game where I have actually payed attention to the story in a long time. The cut scenes flow in and out of the game play but are not so often it feels like you are watching a movie. There is some pretty good humor in this game and the platform sections run pretty well. There were a few times where the fighting became tedious and there was a decent amount of trial and error but nothing that really blemishes the experience. For multiplayer you have several standard death match variations and co op.

In the end I would say that this is an easy 5 out of 5. If you (or a christmas/birthday gift for someone you know) has a ps3 and only uses it for movies I think that this would be the perfect game to get them.

It is a mature action game (mature as in adults will like it too) which is most comparable to the Indiana Jones films.",positive

3982,"What is Mega Man?
---------------------------------
If you have been living under a gaming rock in the NES era, you are Mega Man, a blue robot that is out to take out some, well, the original concept was basically ""trade robots"" gone bad. It starts off with you selecting the robot you want to fight. However, before you can fight them, you have to get through their stage.
Each stage is usually based on the robot itself. Basically, ""Heat Man"" is going to have lava and fire. ""Wood Man"" will be a tree stage.
The game plays a lot like Super Mario, in that you jump a lot from platform to platform, but with a lot more control. You have a basic weapon (P) that is available from the very beginning. You will need to navigate the various challenges in each stage, and will face an end boss, which is the robot you picked. After taking them out, you will get a version of their weapon.
Each robot is weak to another robot's weapon. This will allow you to get through the game much easier. With that in mind, you will want to google the game you are playing and add the word ""Boss Order"" - at least for now. I would like to add a comment later that features all of the orders for all 6 gamers. It just makes the game a lot easier, and for most, passable.
You will find each game varies in difficulty. Mega Man 1 and 3 being much harder than 2 as an example, so it's fun to see what it takes to take out each adventure. For me, I was not able to beat Mega Man 1 without a lot of practice. Now, I can basically walk through the blue guy's adventure.
Mega Man has been one of those titles I have looked back with mixed emotions. I thought it was a great set of games, but I couldn't believe how hard it was.
The level of challenge can put off some gamers, but I do say  keep trying, you will like it.

My Reaction to the Collection:
-------------------------------------
So when I found out my favorite Nintendo collection was coming to PS4, I was pretty excited. Sure, the first thing I thought was, ""There was a Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2""....and you are right. For those that do not know, there was a game collection for PS2 that featured...yes - all 6 NES Mega Man games. With that, do you want to pull out your PS3 that has backwards compatibility (early adopters only), or for most of us, that old PS2 and hook it up just to play these titles? No thanks. The ability to play it on my PS4, to live stream the footage with a push of a button without any extra hardware was very appealing.

So what makes this different?
--------------------------------------------
Lets get this out of the way first  These are basically the original Nintendo (NES) games that you knew and loved. That is Mega Man 1-6 for the NES. In terms of the actual games themselves, other than a few performance improvements to frames in some places (though, this cannot be said by many), its the same games.
What makes it different is the ability to do some challenges in the Challenge mode.
However, the ""Challenge Mode"" makes it worth it to pick up for next gen. The creators created various challenges for us tall to try to beat the fastest. On top of that, they have leaderboards!! It only shows the top 100, but you are able to watch their replay and see if you too can be the best. They vary from different sections of stages from various Mega Man's in the collection, boss rushes, and so much more. The even have a multi colored helmet system to determine if you were ""3 stars"" per challenge to push yourself to do better and better. Thanks a lot Angry Birds.
The Museum mode and Database has a TON of concept art for each game, stats for each enemy and boss as well as tips on how to take out some of those baddies.
There is also a full Music Player, which will allow you to go through some of your mega man favorite tunes, including flash mans stage (my favorite), any boss music, any music from any of the games, all available.
Within the game itself, they also allowed people to change it from the original FULL screen to wide screen and you can have it look like a TV screen did back in the daythose small features that you wouldnt think would be appealing, have all been included.

What is it like playing it on PS4?
-------------------------------------------------
I found it pretty easy to play it on my PS4, but I do have a confession. I used to play these games a lot on emulators for my PC, so have been used to using a PS style controller. With that being said, since it is a digital download, its great to sit on your couch and select the title and pick the next Mega Man you plan to tackle. For me, the live streaming was something I just started getting into (which have few watchers, but are appreciated) and that works great. I even used, on the fly, my Sony Wireless Gold headset and the live stream didn't miss an audio beat (see what I did there?). With being an early adopter, I found myself taking plenty of screenshots of me being on the leaderboards for some of the challenges - knowing I would be kicked off soon by other time bandits. (I am not jealous....okmaybe a little).

So you are asking, do you like it?
------------------------------------------
As a classic gamer myself who started on Atari and NES, Mega Man has a soft spot for being one of those series that I can come back to and feel like the frustrated kid I was back when I played it so many years ago. Being honest, I still have not completed 4-6. With that in mind, I have a lot of new fun to enjoy. If you tried to put this collection together on the original NES, you will pay hundreds. If you have the collection on PS2 or GameCube all ready, I am not sure you will truly need this. For myself, the convenience of this package and the time ill need to get through all the games and challenges, I coulndt be happier with my purchase. Maybe they will bring us the Mega Man X and PS2 games next. Here is hoping.

These are the other Mega Man collections I was talking about previously:

3984,"I have to admit that when I started playing this game for the first time that I was a little put off by it.  It seemed like mass chaos and I didn't know what to do because there was so much going on at once.  However, after about a month of being immersed in the Lego world of the Clone Wars again, I have enjoyed it immensely.  It is just as addicting as the others, and my 6 year old daughter can also play with relative ease.  It proves to be more challenging the others, which is never a bad thing, and the level of unlockable material is great.  I really enjoy how the Classic Star Wars characters, like Princess Leia and Qui-Gon Jinn are unlockable only after finding the Mini-Kits in each level.  I liked the added lightsaber attributes, like cutting holes in metal doors, and throwing it at characters.  You also have to get enough Gold Bricks in order to move through the ""Hub"" type area.  This is on board the large spaceship, and you can move to another one with the villain characters as well.  The characters to unlock are not simply in one location where you can purchase, which adds to the challenge of collecting all characters.  At first, I was a little put off by this, because I was so used to the other format, but I think I like this way better.  The challenge is what makes this game so fun.  This is a great addition to the Lego franchise, and I am looking forward to playing other additions, like the Lego Pirates game coming out soon.  I am curious to see what comes after that one.  I will buy them all as long as they keep making them.",negative
3985,"True balance between action and role play... actually, a little more emphasis on action.  Truly remarkable creation and a rich mix of ideas which amount to an engaging and fantastic adventure. The world is large, grand and beautifully rendered.

Just to say, if u like RPGs, this one is a no brainer. Easily a 5 star. I have played many RPGs from Final Fantasy 7, 8, 9, 12, Legend of Zelda (a whole bunch of them), just to name a few. This one is right up there with the best I ever played. Elements of other games, but unique in it's own right.

Quick Pros:
-beautiful and breathtaking
-character creation, basic, but enough to make your character your own
-loads of weapons, armor, magic, and abilities to level up.
-craft some of the things you will use
-free roaming environment
-engaging main story, many side missions

I found a well rounded game with no real cons, but I have some recommendations for the next installment in the series if there is one
-extended character creation options
-more varied boss type battles (many of the bosses fight with similar styles)
-some online interactivity (even a common area for players to communicate and trade crafted items)

I took in many reviews before getting this game, n they were spot on. A land mark game.

Final Verdict - This game was well worth it when I got it at 40 bucks, and is a steal at now 20 bucks. Easy 5 stars.",positive
3986,great,negative
3987,"While Fallout 3 was an excellent game, it lacked the charm of Fallout 1 and 2 - both of which are on my personal list of favorite games. Fallout New Vegas captures the original vision of Fallout and that original sense of dark humor, spot on. While there are several annoying and embarrassingly bad bugs, I was fortunate enough to not run into anything that was game-breaking.

Graphics: I sincerely hope that the current Gamebryo engine has seen its last release with Fallout NV. For a triple A title such as this, the engine looks horrendous. There are some nice motion blur and lighting effects here and there, but generally the graphics are outdated. Two fundamental components - textures and models - are my biggest concern, as they look washed out and clunky, respectively. I felt the same way when Fallout 3 had come out (at that time, comparing the game's engine to TES IV: Oblivion as they use the same engine) - but now the graphical shortcomings are exacerbated. Truthfully, some aspects of Fallout NV look worse than Fallout 3. There are graphical glitches aplenty but nothing (so far) to detract from the overall gaming experience.

Sound: Fallout remains as atmospheric as ever. I love the fact that the soundtrack captures the spirit of the original west-coast setting - and I love Obsidian for graciously including many of the best tracks from the original games! Music aside, the voice acting is simply fantastic. Perhaps not on par with Dragon Age (which had some of the best voice-work I've ever heard in an RPG), but Fallout NV is head-and-shoulders above Fallout 3. Gone are the same voice actors that were recycled from Oblivion and gone are the wooden deliveries. Environmental/ambient audio is also very well done. Giant and obsolete radio towers gently moan when you pass underneath them, the sounds of distant gunshots can be heard occassionally, dust devils whip sand around....there is certainly a lot of variety here.

Gameplay: The quest and general `RPG' structure is solid. While the main plot is relatively straightforward, you are better off ignoring it altogether and focusing on the myriads of additional quests available in the game. Most of the side-quests are quite involving and thoroughly entertaining. As far as quest decisions go, let me just say that the consequences carry a lot of weight and there are several potential outcomes in most cases. Fallout NV's world is not black or white - there are (several) shades of gray to consider. At key points, I found myself struggling to lock in on a particular dialogue response  - and I mean that as a compliment. The combat is fun as ever - at least whenever you're in VATs. Out of VATs it can still feel a little lame. This is a much more challenging game than F3. I was getting my butt handed to me early on. Also, if you haven't leveled up high enough and you spot a Deathclaw - you better run the other way. Trust me. There are several companions that you can find along the way, including a dutiful eyebot that `sounds off' with bravado every time you engage in combat. I love the little guy. Unfortunately as great as the gameplay mechanics are, there are also several bugs that mire the surface. For one, companions don't seem to respond to the parameters you set. I specifically instruct my human squad-mate not to engage unless I do, and s/he runs up guns blazing every single time. There are several other bugs but my understanding is that a comprehensive patch is coming out or has just come out recently.

In closing I have to say that Fallout New Vegas is a fantastic game. Early on I was very worried about how it would turn out given Obsidian's misfire with Alpha Protocol, but I'll happily admit that my fears were unfounded. Yes there are some major bugs, but the overall package is tremendously entertaining and can easily eat up 70+ hours of your life. I wouldn't mind Obsidian taking over development of all future Fallout games. The amount of business the resurrected franchise is earning Zenimedia, further sequels are a no-brainer. I hope they spend more time ironing out the cracks...in the meantime, Bethesda can get busy with an Elder Scrolls V.",neutral
3988,"This is the best basketball game out for the PS2. I didn't even buy NBA Live after playing it a few times, but this game is a keeper.
As soon as you play this disc, you'll see great graphics and smooth control play that made EA Sports Big's other game, SSX, such a great hit. This game allows you to do the funkiest moves and plays that you only would see on tv. You know that Nike commercial with the montage of mad dribbling skills? Reproduce those moves with the players in NBA Street.
You get to play on great courts with cool characters in addition to NBA players. There are many things to discover in this game on your own. Multiplayer is even better as you try to outfake your opponent. Don't expect realism in this game. It wouldn't be fun if it was. Just expect doing major things you only wish you could do on the court. Overall, a game worth buying and playing over and over. Well worth the money.",positive

3992,"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link was the sequel to one of the best games ever made for the NES. It was released in 1988 for the NES and was the first Zelda game to cause quite a stir because it was revered and loathed at the same time. I won't get into the huge debate that still rages on to this very day. All you need to know is that even though it doesn't ""look"" like the first game, it is still a Zelda game and advanced the story line while it added new game play mechanics, characters and a quest that made it quite unique.

This was an excellent sequel to the classic NES game, The Legend of Zelda. It brought the RPG aspect found in RPG games mixing it with side scroller action found in most platforming games at the time. It's also a pretty hard game and the challenge stays with you. Though you could find the original NES cartridge, you can settle for tracking down the GBA cart instead and it probably won't cost as much. You can also find this title on Nintendo's Virtual Console Service and buy it for 500 points (US $5.00) If you haven't played this game and are still hung up about taking a chance on it, look at some YouTube videos to get an idea.

I loved this game and have the original NES cartridge. It didn't deserve to be branded as the black sheep of the Zelda series just because it was radically different from the first game. Parts of Zelda II made it into future games so that says a lot right there. If you don't have this game yet, do not wait any longer! *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED****",positive

3999,"I liked this mouse so much I ordered another one for my laptop. The battery life is insane and combined with rechargeable batteries I will save enough to buy another one if I can come up with a good excuse.

This mouse replaced the Logitech G700s I was using. The battery life of the G700s was really bad. I could go through fresh batteries in two days time. I've only replaced the batteries in this mouse twice. I used up the batteries it shipped with, then I stuck a single partially charged battery in it and then two fresh charged batteries this last go.

The mouse is very responsive and the different sensitivity settings are very nice for both gaming and productivity. It has a nice weight to it that corded mice don't have but  it isn't heavy. The receiver is in my tower about 3.5' from the mouse and I have no tracking issues. It is a solid performer all around.

I've been using this mouse nearly every day for the last 5 months and someone would have to give me a mouse to get me to try another one and as of this writing (9/11/2014) had for ~$60.00. If you're on the fence I can highly recommend this product.",positive

as someone who enjoys all types of games i find that there is plenty of variety in good games for me to play. from oblivion to Call of duty to marvel ultimate alliance and saints row. my girlfriend even enjoyed laura croft and im probably going to get her viva piniata'.

the games are great but don't forget the system.

the wireless controller is by far the best controller ive ever used. period.

the xbox dashboard system is simple and easy to use. xpecially now with the new oct/November '06 update.

xbox live is definately the best console internet setup to date.

xbox live arcade has dozens of wonderful games for people of all ages. from old classics to new innovative games, and its truly a good setup. a lot of people complain about microsoft points but this allows me to buy cards for my little cousins for points, instead of pulling out my credit card or their parents CC.

the power and performance of this system is great. and realize that we're already on a 2nd year of release games for the 360. many reviews and comments are from the early games which are nothing to look at compared to the new games and content that are being released.

without a decision to the format war ( Blu-ray vs HD DVD ) i feel that a wii or 360 is the only way to go!!!

btw: Microsoft is releasing the HD DVD player to attach with the 360 and it supports 1080p (just like all xbox games that support 1080i now support 1080p thanks to the new update)

BUT they have stated that if the HD DVD format fails that the xbox 360 can easily be fitted with a blu ray dvd format... IF HD loses the battle... PS3 does not give you that option. if blu ray loses the battle which is 50/50 up in the air. then that blu ray dvd player doesnt seem so wonderful now does it?",positive

The graphics on this new GOW really push the PS3 abilities, sound is awesome especially with surrounds sound/tritton 5.1 headset. I'm glad they made it to display in full 1080p, I get really disappointed when games are made in 720p and you can notice how bad the textures are displayed/stretched in ""some"" games sometimes.

This adds both aggrivation and fun and since its 2015 all the combitions are online via ign cheats..so no need to do it the hard way! After unlocking your roster the single player gives many options and ways to play. My fav is team battle because I can do a ssj4 fusion in game and win fused as a fused warrior! The sound track is the best I have ever heard in a dbz game and even beats todays games on just sounding epic! The stages are many and the combo system is very deep and complex once you build knowedge..but even as a casual player this game is awsome! Xenoverse has great combos and gameplay flow but...it still sux due to broken drops of items and victory endings being complete trash..add in all the recasted voices and it starts to feel really broken...especially when you have to pay for nova shenron. This game not only will give you a strong roster like playable great apes but also beautiful ki blasts and explosions of the entire planet..dbz is dead due to the new direction the company is choosing..(seriously goku is no God) but this game keeps the life of real 90's dbz burning warm and bright.

4019,"First of all, it's a comic book game without a comic book mythos to draw from. This huge sandbox game lets you slip into the shoes of Cole MacGrath, the victim of some sort of radiation. Immediately, the game starts off with Cole barely able to move and supposing his guilt for a huge explosion that leveled a huge section of downtown Empire City. Looters form gangs and divide up the chaotic city into huge turfs of dangerous mortar and asphalt. It seems that Cole begins to develop electricity-based powers. And the further down the storyline he goes, the more powers he gets, and the level of power increases too. Players are able to advance as they wish, divvying up experience to increase whatever they are able. It seems that he is to be the most powerful man on the island-city.

But the first bit of brilliance is that you aren't stuck in the role of hero; you can be just as evil if you desire. Another fine point being that you can literally go anywhere you want, just so long as you don't try to go swimming. The mechanics can be a little trick to learn, but the game scales well enough not to put you into a situation the character cannot yet handle. No spoilers here, as I am sure most everyone reading the reviews for this game are already familiar with the story. Suffice to say, it is top-notch and shows off a fair number of sub-plots.

This is one of those game that does pay to play again, if only to experience the story from the opposing alignment. Overall, this is a great game with tremendous mechanics that will most likely be used in many games to come.",negative

4022,"Last year I was putting together my Christmas list, and came across a game called ""Grand Theft Auto 3"". I read the reviews, looked at the pictures, ect., and decided it looked pretty cool. I got it. I put it in my PS2, and played it for more than six hours straight, and it was night before I even unwrapped my other PS2 games. It was great! Now, the much, much anticiapated sequel arrives. I rented it yesterday and am very impressed. The anticipation was well lived up to. Even though it's not as amazing to run around and kill people, steal cars, and all that, it's just as fun. My current personal favorite thing is the motorcycles. I drive around for half hours looking for one. Their the most fun things to drive; very fast, easy to control, and it's great to collide into things and get hurled off, even if it does take some health away. Anyway, the setting is in a Flordia-type place in the (yeah, I know you already know) 80's. This time, our hero, Tommy, can actully talk instead of doing this annoying nods and motions. The radio stations are great, as well, just as good as 3's. The music stations all play songs from the 80's. But the only two stations I really listen to is KChat (I liked Chatterbox on the first. KChat's not as good, basically because the host is NO Lazlo) and VRock, which plays songs from Anthrax to Slayer to Ozzy (and even has an 80's Lazlo as the host, which is AWESOME). The commercials are just as sick, twisted, and hilarious. On your weaponry, you have every single firing-weapon and can have different physical weapons, such as your fists, iron knuckles, chainsaws, ninja swords, golf clubs, butcher knives, and more. Also, you can now go into buildings and explore yourself. Some of these places are the mall (which contains the ninja sword somewhere), Bunch of Tools, and more. You can buy places, such as the Malibou Night Club and Washington Street, and get all the profit they make, but it'll cost ya a couple thousand.

I was very surprised at how smooth this game runs and how many different things there are in each Princesses world to do before you are complete with that one.  After you complete your missions in Ariel, Jasmine, Cinderella, and Snow White's world..you unlock a bonus game with Belle. We are working onthat one now, having a hard time figuring out how to do what they are asking.  It took my daughter 3 days to get thru the 4 princesses, playing just over an hour each time.  She loves it! The graphics are great, the loading time between each thing is really fast; much faster than most of our other Wii games!  Even the voices of the Princesses sound like the ones on TV!  Really impressed with this game. My daughter does have some trouble with the ""wand"" movements and using the nunchuk to walk, but you don't need the nunchuk you can use the arrows on the Wii, but she feels the need to use it.  Its hard for her to make the girl walk in a straight line for some reason.  She also has some mild trouble with wand motions...there is one where you wave your arm up and down and another one when you circle it above your head - She will be clearly circling it and the girl on the screen will do the opposite.

4038,"It has been almost 20 years, and the Legend of Zelda is still very much alive and kicking. Exclusively made for the Game Boy Advance, The Minish Cap is the latest instalment of this very popular series. Developed by Capcom with input from Nintendo, The Minish Cap is a classic Legend of Zelda game that entails a strong plot, mind-boggling puzzles and some very tough battles.

Taking the role of Link, you must put together the pieces of a broken blade by fusing four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water) into the sword to stop the evil deeds of the sorcerer Vaati. Link also has to revive Princess Zelda, who was turned into stone by Vaati. Can this woman ever get out of trouble?

Link's quest involves exploring a massive overworld, as well as six dungeons. Apart from getting items and upgrades along the way, Link also has a companion in the form of Ezlo, a hybrid of a bird and a hat. Weird as this may sound, Ezlo literally rides on Link throughout the game, and provides hints should Link gets stuck. Not that his hints are any good, by the way, but he does have an important role in the proceedings, but I won't spoil it for you.

The combination of Ezlo and portals scattered around the maps allow Link to be shrunk into ant-size. This allows him to interact with a tribe of people known as the Picoris or the Minish, who secretly lives in various parts of Hyrule. Basically, this is a ""Honey, I shrunk the Kids"" concept, but it works very well here. Looking at the world from a whole new perspective, Link's quest gets all the more difficult when enemies whom he can kill easily when he's normal become a tough challenge. Ever thought killing an Octorock will take you half an hour?

Apart from the classic weapons, Link also has an array of items to play with. Among them is the Gust Jar, which allows Link to suck in and split out air. This comes in handy against some well-protected enemies. The Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through sand, which is very useful when finding treasures. And in a bold move, Link also gets an improved version of the Roc's Cape, which allows him to sort of fly momentarily. You'll be amazed to see Link does a Superman impression late in the game. Also, the Grip Ring lets Link climb mountains, while the Pegasus Boots helps him walk across quicksand. Even classic items get an upgrade, with bombs now capable of being remotely controlled by Link. Strategic bombing, anyone?

Solving puzzles is an important part of this game. Apart from the block-pushing stunt that is so connected to Zelda games, a gimmick from the previous Four Swords game is also included. After infusing some elements into his sword, Link can multiply himself by charging his sword, which allows him to push even heavier blocks. Some puzzles also require Link to respond quickly, for example, a lever-controlled bridge that retracts almost immediately after he loosen the grip. All in all, the variety of puzzles are acceptable, and very interesting to play with.

Treasures in The Minish Cap take the form of rupees, kinstones and mysterious shells. Kinstones? Mysterious shells? Yes, you read it right. Kinstones Fusion plays a large part in the game. By fusing, it simply means collecting a fragment of a stone, and matching it with someone with a, well, matching fragment. If the pieces fit perfectly, an event will happen somewhere on the map. While some fusions create random events, the more rare red and gold kinstones are essential in changing the course of the game. To put it simply, these fusions are compulsory, so it could take up some of your time finding the right pieces. Although this is a nice idea, it does make the game a little too linear for my liking. The free-roaming nature of past Zelda games takes the backseat in this time round.

Now, even when Link is eager to save the world, he's entitled to have a hobby. Figurines Collection is a non-compulsory part of the game that incorporates the Japanese ""Gashapon"" concept, which basically involves trying out his luck with a toy machine. When Link meets new people (or monsters) in the game, figurines of these are made by a master sculptor. Visiting the sculptor's shop, Link could get chances to earn these figures by exchanging mysterious shells with him. There are a total of 136 figurines in all, so it could take forever. Then again, I can see the greed in your eyes.

The graphics and audios In The Minish Cap complement the overall feel of the game superbly. It's heartening to see such intricate details on a 2D game. The colors are also vibrant and attractive, making it a really pleasant playing experience. The music is a mixture of old school and new scores, and to a certain extent, they blend well. Some parts are too bouncy, but on the whole, the feel is just right.

In summary, The Minish Cap delivers. While the main quest is rather short, the amount of side quests lengthens the overall playing time. If you only have the dough for one game this month, make The Minish Cap your top priority.",positive

4040,"It was the first wii game I and my family played. At first it was pretty hard. And we were getting frustrated but we were out to win!
Love the fact that we can play on teams too.
It is a little difficult for our 3 year old he tends to spin in circles and (sigh) he does know he isn't playing so well.",positive

4042,"I've never bought a Tomb Raider game before this one. Actually, I did buy the Lara Croft PSN/Xbox Live game, but that's not really a Tomb Raider game in the classic sense. I also received a free copy of Tomb Raider: Underworld via PlayStation Plus, but I've yet to finish it, and don't have much drive to.

However, Tomb Raider is not only the first Lara Croft game I've paid full price for, but one of a very few games I've picked up almost immediately after it was released. And it wasn't a bad decision.

After playing Tomb Raider I not only cared about Lara's story, I want it to continue. I want to pick up Tomb Raider 2 (or whatever they call it).

So it has a good story. How about the game play? I dare say that it's taken what Uncharted has done and stepped it up a level. Done what Darksiders II should have done to successfully follow up Darksiders' Zelda-like features. It is a sandbox game that knows when to stop expanding, and when to draw the story to a close.

The only issue I really have with the game is the multiplayer. Trophies/achievements give you an idea of what the developers were thinking. Almost a third of the trophies/achievements for this game are in multiplayer. However, the multiplayer is, at best, lackluster. And with the announcement that future DLC will only be for the multiplayer, I'm disappointed they felt they had to throw MP into an otherwise solid game.

Despite this, it takes nothing away from the core experience. It is a solid game, and I found it to be well worth the $60, and at less than that it would be a steal.

5 of 5 stars (or 9 out of 10).",positive
4043,"I played this game and never wanted to stop. In my opinion, this is the best RPG game ever. It is fun just to play, and run around. The graphics are great, and it is just plain fun. What is also nice is that getting past certain parts of levels aren't very hard, and you don't get upset playing it.
Pros:
1) Great graphics
2) Great plot/storyline
3) Characters look great
4) Easy figuring out what to do
5) Just plain fun
Cons:
1) Ummm",negative

4045,"This is one of my favorite videogames! There are a lot of differences compared to Sonic Adventure 1!
1. The graphics-The graphics are so much different than those of Sonic Adventure 1!
2. The stages-The levels are longer and harder.
There are much more differences! The harder level is Cannon's Core. Its so long and hard that its my favorite level! There are more than 30 levels and the Chao! They are more cute and intelligent! Now there is a Kindergarten that has the Health Center, Classroom, and Principal office. And if you get all 180 embles, you get a reward! A 3d Green Hill that appeard in Sonic 1!

4047,"From the very beginning this game will hook you in with its new formula of survival horror. Some say its more Action/Horror but I guarantee that you are trying to survive horros like: legions of villagers, gigantic bosses, monks, chainsaw wielding freaks, prisoners with claws that make Wolverine's seem imputent, and much much more than I will spoil here.

The tosses out the old and brings in a new age of Survival Horror, the series has needed an overhaul for years! Purists will always whine about any change made, they would rather see a franchise run itself into the ground by repeating the same formula with a new coat of paint. But to re-invision a franchise and make it better is what keep players interested in buiying the games. CAPCOM is understandably excited about this game, and GameCube owners over the age of 17 should defintely buy it if they like gore, guns, and a challenge.

In a way I find myself reminded of old-school CAPCOM action games, because the game is obviously a game for once instead of trying to mimic a too realistic model that isn't as fun to play. For instance there is this demon guy you can buy weapons and upgrades from found in different locations throughout the game. When you kill things, they leave behind ammo, heal items, or sell items. The end of each chapter sees a screen totalling your kills, hit percentage, and other stats that you can try to perfect. This is what gaming is all about people! It boils down to one of the best games ever made, and if you don't have a Cube (too bad) it will eventually be out for PS2 this fall/winter.",positive
4048,"I can't believe all the negative reviews this game is getting.  I know there are alot of Madden haters out there because EA racked up the NFL exclusive video game deal so no more ESPN 2K (which in my opinion sucked...great graphics, but no substance and the gameplay was so arcade feeling).  Madden is still great.  So the graphics haven't changed much from last year.  It still looks great but gameplay is what is most important and it is still the most realistic football game made.  As far as the reviewers bashing the new Passing system.  It takes practice. I've been playing with the Dolphins and as bad as A.J. Feeley is I'm not throwing anymore INTs than I would excpect the real Feeley to throw this coming season.  Look at it this way it makes it more realistic.  I see the complaints about I'm getting sacked too much, I'm throwing too many INTs.  BOO HOO!  Don't you think this is what the NFL is all about.  If you are a QB don't you realize you are going to have four or five guys closing in on you when you drop back to pass and that you would have to scan the field for the open receiver while all this chaos is going on around you?  Start practicing!!!!",negative
4049,"I loved Dead Space.  If you did too, you'll love Dead Space 2.
The story is interesting and they've re-invented the main character into, first of all, a speaker, and second of all someone who's basically running the show contrary to someone who's being told what to do.
Combat is identical (and awesome), the gore is.. just as gory, and you'll get plenty of game time out of this experience.  I can't recommend it enough!",positive
4050,"This is the first time i've ever bought a game mainly because of the music in it. (it's really good). The game is a lot of fun to play and although you can play as 2 different characters with different story lines, it doesn't take long to finish either one of their stories. Jumping around in order to fight 2 or 3 bosses can be a pain at times, but other than that, the gameplay is pretty solid.",positive

4065,"Let's face it, Diablo 3 had a TERRIBLE launch.  The servers went through a multitude of problems on launch day, the day after launch, a few rolling restarts and server/game crashes.  However, being one of the most anticipated games of 2012, beating out Mass Effect 3, Max Payne 3, and probably all but Black Ops II, I can assure you that it's worth the wait.

The loot system is just as complex as before, the rune system is re-worked so no longer is it item based, it now adds an additional effect to a skill, making certain abilities better for solo play, or group play.  Some abilities also are more useful depending on the difficulty.  Do you want to be a glass cannon on Hell or Inferno, or do you want to take reduced damage to kill longer?  Avoidance or Damage?  Heals or CC?  There are plenty of ways to play the game.  I wish that the game still allowed 8 players at a time, and who knows, maybe this feature will be re-implemented again in an expansion.

How many people are going to be making Diablo 3 their next part time job come 5/22/12?  I think it's an interesting way to keep people playing, although I will have to laugh at the people that will actually pay money for an item you will never physically own other than in a video game.

What Diablo 3 has done right:
* Very easy to join games with your friends, open your Friends panel, right click the person, and invite or join to party.
* No more having to worry about your characters getting deleted after 90 days of not playing them, or 2 hours in the first 48 hours of play.
* The loot is still very complex and you will be scratching your head and seeing if this item is an upgrade
* Skills are done to give diversity on how to play a class, no longer will you be forced to reroll if you screw up a talent point, or attribute wrong(Even though later patches in Diablo 2 fixed this)
* Scaling difficulty the more people that play, that was a very good feature in Diablo 2 and made it a challenge and fun to kill Baal and Diablo in 8 player games by yourself.
* No longer punished if you join games with people that are further along in quests.  You can play along with them and still progress.
* Quest leeching, while it could be annoying in public games, at least it's an easy way to level up a noob without getting slaughtered.
* Hardcore mode, definatly has the same feel as in Diablo 2.  This time around, expect people to die a lot easier if you don't stack Vitality along with your primary stats.
* No USEast, USWest, it's all one.  There are still Asian servers, among others, that don't seem to have the issues the US Servers are having.
* No Town Portal Scrolls, no ID scrolls(You still have to right click to ID Legendary and Rare items, but no longer do you have to waste inventory to do so, like in the Beta)
* Achievements to up the replay value after you've gotten past Diablo 3 on Inferno with all 5 characters.
* Being able to choose which quests to repeat, for missing books, side dungeons, or exploration puroses.
* Banner porting and customization of your banner, the banner porting makes it VERY easy to get back in the game with your teammates that are rushing to complete quests rather than loot or take trips to town.
*** The Collector's Edition, like all four Warcraft games, Warcraft 3, and Starcraft 2, feel like Collector's Editions.  If you didn't buy one for $99.99, have fun paying double.  You get the standard Soundtrack, Art Book, the making of Diablo 2, but the items that stand out, you get Angelic Wings, which make your characters stand out, you get a unique banner and sigil(If you played in the Beta), Diablo Skull and 4GB Soulstone Flash Drive glows red when in your computer!  It also comes with Diablo 2 and Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction(A $20 value) pre-loaded onto the flash drive, much like Starcraft 2 did with their Collector's Edition.

What Diablo 3 has done wrong:
* Always online DRM, not everyone has an internet connection, LAN and single player was a very big part of the success of Diablo 2, and well, some people don't want to play the game with other people.
* Very limited chat channels, you have about 8 pre-set channels to join.  No more clan channels.
* No guilds.  This is a feature that would greatly benefit players because it would be easier to communicate with your friends.
* No guild halls with a stash, again, a great feature that would make it easier to give items to people in different time zones.
* When Diablo 3 has to undergo maintenance, you can't play at all!  Single player should be allowed.
* 4 Player games, I think 8 players would've done well, especially if everyone could complete every quest in a game even in different acts.

A lot of people will knock Diablo 3 for various reasons, however, those same people will praise Diablo 3 for different reasons.  No games are perfect.",neutral
4066,"Sony has never been known to be better at FPS, Microsoft rules that part since Halo, the problem is this, if you like the sony you definatly will hate 360, and if your into 360 you probably won't bother getting the PS3, for people who got their sony PS3, congrats, but its known that when ever a system first comes out then you get problems and glitches, it happened to every system, the game is great but yes i agree it was to hyped up wich might disapoint many, and if you don't have HD TV then you aren't really experiencing the power of the PS3 or 360
the game was sold out had to wait for it, get it for sure, great game amazing graphics, the weapons are cool and i don't want to spoil this for any onbe just get it

4068,"I thought the first one was a timeless classic and the best of the series. I have completed all of the Layton games completely. I have enjoyed all of them - fun stories and great puzzles to solve - as good as adventure games get. This game is my favorite now - even over the first one which is almost perfect. This game has 3D graphics which make it more enjoyable and a bit different from the previous ones. Also much more voice acting as well.

The same qualities that make a Layton game a Layton game are still here however - beautiful hand drawn graphics and interesting characters to meet and interact with. So, if you loved any of the DS Layton outings, you'll love this one - better graphics, more voice acting and the best story since The Curious Village - all in 3D too - just the perfect mix for Layton's first 3DS outing.",positive

I think the quality of the graphics actually work better in certain scenes, like with Don Corneo. Better/updated graphics would ruin the whole 'corny' angle. Though updated movie scenes would be nice. The playable characters are nicely varied, from all walks of life. Of course I hate the time-consuming leveling up part, as I do in all RPGs, though the Materia add-ons are the best ones I like of the Final Fantasy series so far(played them all from the original up to XII, with the exception of V and IX). The story does take a while to get interesting, but that doesn't bother me too much, with all the side quests available.",positive

4079,"Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the second game in a series of three (to date).  It is available for XBOX, Play Station 2, PC, Game Cube and Game Boy Advance.  This review is in reference to the Xbox version.

The game is set in 2006: a corrupt guerilla militia attacked the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta.  They now occupy the building and have taken dozens of hostages.  This is where you come in, but not to save the hostages. There are top secret documents located somewhere within the embassy: you must find and destroy them before the terrorists have a chance to get hold of them.

Building on the enormous success of the original Splinter Cell game, Pandora Tomorrow once again pushes the boundaries beyond expectations.  All areas of the game - the lighting & shadowing, animation, physics and sound design have been boosted to create an even more enveloping environment to play in.  The single player game is nothing short of fantastic: it boasts a set of new hi-tech gadgets for you to play with as well as new moves to help you evade and engage your enemies.

However, the truly groundbreaking aspect of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the Multiplayer mode.  The only game of its kind, the Splinter Cell's multiplayer mode pits two on two in a very unique way; two stealthy, agile spies with third person perspective against two armed & deadly mercenaries in first person view.  You wouldn't think it would work as well as it does, but it's perhaps the most well balanced multiplayer game ever made. Mercenaries may have lethal weapons, but spies are faster, can climb, hang and break your neck.  Spies can move more quickly through the shadows, but mercenaries have an available motion tracking vision.  Mercenaries have motion tracking but spies have hidden routs to travel unseen, etc. etc. etc. - it is this type of counteractive system that is applied to every facet of the MP experience. It's extremely addictive and even more fun than it sounds.  A wide variety of maps are available to choose from, all of which are incredibly well designed.  Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is not a revamp of the original, but is an original itself.",positive

4081,"I've played Borderlands on the PS3 and the Xbox 360 and the edge goes to the 360 because of the controller.

While playing Uncharted I didn't think the controller felt bad. The reason was they assigned ""fire"" to the R1 button. When I hold the PS3 controller my fingers naturally rest on that button. With Borderlands they want you to use L2 and R2 constantly. It's not a very comfortable position and the matter was made worst by the triggers. Your fingers had no resistance.

So these are essential, in my opinion, for any game which requires the use of the L2 and R2 buttons. I really hope Sony redesigns their controller next gen. But seeing as I have a choice, I'll just stick to the 360 for multi-platform games.",negative

4085,"Disney's Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force for DS is a great addition to any DS library. Based upon the online game, but with one cool difference: you become part of a special group...the 'ELITE' Penguin Force via this game.

You begin with a mini-mission, followed with a meeting with Agent 'D' who leads you to Elite Penguin Force Training. The game itself is 'Top Secret', but once you complete training you'll have all access and be able to upload (to Club Penguin online)  'coins' earned by your Elite Force penguin on the DS game. You'll also be able to upload missions, or do it in the reverse and download from your online account to your DS. **This is a cool feature, as earning coins gives you more things for your penguins to play with on Club Penguin.**

NOTE: you will have to have a wireless connection between your PC and the DS to upload and download information (coins/missions) between the two.

4097,"Saint's Row 2 is just about everything fans of the original could've asked for, and more! Right off the bat, you'll notice just how many improvements have been done over the original. You start off in a coma, and you're asked to either re-create your guy from the last game, or make someone new. And this time, you can have a girl play as Stilwater's legendary gangster! You can go around the 'Saint's Row' equivalent of Chicago as a male or female.

The character customizations have been far expanded, and rival that of another THQ franchise, The ""WWE SmackDown! Vs. RAW"" series. You can fine tune just about any facial feature to your liking, and once the game starts, you can buy your way up to owning cool clothes, which are far superior to the first game's clothing options. Even in Sloppy Seconds, you can customize color, material, and style of your clothing. Of course, keep in mind that Sloppy Seconds has some pretty awful clothes, too! I had my guy back in Saint's Purple in no time! The women's clothing is far less appealing though, although maybe I just haven't unlocked the hot Victoria's Secret wear, yet. The character cutomization truly is more advanced this time around, but a little bit of things irk me in the customization.

For example, you can't choose height once again in your character. In the first game, the Protagonist was way too short. About 5'6"" or so. In this, he's kinda too tall. Maybe 6'1"" or 6'2"", but he (or she, as females have the same towering height as your men) completely towers over everyone else in town. Also, the body options are kinda weird. It's like, you can only choose a body ""type"" for them, like obese, or thin, and you can't fine tune things, like their stomach or chest. For women, their breasts are kind of too pointy. For men, their body shape is kind of odd, with big arms and a slightly disproportionate body (assuming your guy isn't an obese fellow). Some things are kind of too in-depth (like ear customization, for example. Who cares about ears?) While the body customizations could've been more expanded. Also, the ""Personality"" features aren't as in-depth as I was hoping for. Basically, you choose voice, walking style, compliment taunt, and insult taunts. The voices are basically White, Black, and Hispanic male and females. The White guy voice is British, probably because the game developers are also, British, and they wanted a local guy in there. I'm guessing most people will end up using the Black Male voice or White Female voice. The gender equality goes beyond your main character though, and also shows up in the gangs, too, as before, only about 10% of your enemies were female, as now it's about 40% of women in the enemy gangs. And it seems like the entire police force seems to made up of women, which is a little odd.

When you actually begin, you start off with a prison break, and get access to the newly expanded fighting system. While very simple to use, it's actually quite hard to master, and I like that. Basically, you can punch two different ways, do combos, and block. There's other things you can learn later too, like the new Human Shield option, where you can toss people acorss streets like they're only 10 pounds light. Of course, this is just for your basic fighting style. You'll learn new ways to brawl later in the game, as well! You also now also pick up inanimate objects like cinderblocks, trash cans, or virtually anything, and use them as makeshift fighting weapons. Your non-firearm weapons have greatly been expanded, and the variety of different melee weapons rivals that of San Andreas. However, in this game, you can make much cooler use of them! I stongly suggest once you hit the streets of new Stilwater, to find a Ronin gang member and steal his or her katana blade. That thing rocks! Both objects and newer melee attacks are also available in Grand Suck Auto IV, but Saint's Row 2 makes much better uses out of all of them! It's a complete no contest here in which game's are better. With weapons, all your favorites are back, and the annoying habit of constantly having to switch out guns for ammo to get different ones that have been taken off of your enemies is gone! Because now, we have dual-weilding, baby! Your guy or girl will be able to shoot out two Vice 9's, at once, now, and do it like the pro they are! Unlike San Andreas, you won't have to level up skill points to earn advanced weaponry weilding because the game assumes your guy is already a master of the firearms from the first game! I love how convient Volition are! They're willing to cut the crap (like having to swim miles to make it to shore) and just give you the fun gaming goodness you want from the get-go! When you deal with explosives, if you're too close to the blast, it'll blast out your character's ear drums and they'll be temporally deaf! It's a nice touch with really shows you how much explosives can mess your character up! Saint's Row 2 also gives you Autosaving, so if your game freezes on you or the power goes out, you can start off from the last mission or activity you completed. Autosaving at first doesn't seem to useful, but once an unexpected something DOES happen to you or your game, you'll be so glad it's there! I made it to Lv. 6 of Drug Trafficking and didn't save any of it when my 360 shut down on me. But with the Autosave feature, I was able to restart from the end of Lv. 5 and not lose a thing! It's such a great and convient feature to have!

Once again, you'll have to earn respect to do new missions, but the Activities now are a lot more fun, and many of the lame ones from the first game, except the stupid Insurance Fraud ones, which I've always hated, are gone. Activities are now divided by Diversions (the lesser, old Activities) and the true ""Activities"" now are the ones that take much longer time to complete, such as Chop Shop and Hit Man, which once again make a return. I hopped in a car with my girl and immeadially started a Drive-By activity on some Sons of Samedi. Now, in the Diversions, there are six levels instead of eight, and for some, you can continue up to each level without interuption. I didn't even know I was on Level 5 in Drive-By until I actually checked up the top of the screen. The new diversion activities are awesome. ""vehicle Surfing"" is tricky but fun, until you fall of the car, that is! In ""Trail Blazing"" you get to race to a checkpoint all while on fire, blowing up cars on impact and lighting people on fire, earning time. It's sort of a mix of Mayhem and Racing, and it's very fun. ""Fuzz"" is the Stilwater equivalent of Cops and you get to play as the all-around corrupt police officer, hurting people breaking the law, and getting good and violent footage for the TV show. By the further levels, it gets really fun and interesting, like stopping a Pirate-Ninja war! ""Crowd Control"" has you playing as a celebrity bodyguard, stopping mobs of crazy fans from hurting your client! Depending on the level, you can trhow people into chopper blades, toss them into attack dogs, crush them with a bulldozer, cram them into an airport security x-ray machine, or chuck em into an oncoming el train!

There are more ways to earn respect now, too. Inspired by the Balls Meter from the ""Scarface: The World Is Yours"" game, you can now earn respect by doing ballsy things that Tony Montana did in his game, like driving in the wrong lane of traffic and taunting bad people like cops and gang members, and also now pimps and hoes, who are now official ""enemies"", as well. The only thing missing is the ability to yell at people who crash into your car while driving. Just don't get TOO much respect before using it up on missions, though, as after Lv. 99, your respect is Infinite, and that sort takes all the fun out of it, having Infinite respect and all.

The new Stilwater is a much darker, depressing place than the old Stilwater, which is ironic considering that the old Stilwater was probably much more violent. It's about 50% larger, and the new places are less inviting to you than you'd think they'd be. They clearly don't like your kind around there. The new gangs have a bit more unity than the old ones did, and respect each other's territories, leaving the endangered Third Streets Saint's pretty much their only common enemy. Many parts of old Stilwater have been rebuilt by Ultor's multi-million dollar city renovation. With Ultor Corporation owning Stilwater and turning it into a bleak metropolis for the Upper Class and snobby, you'll have the incredible feeling of both familarity and newness, all at the same time. Some old, favorite neighborhoods will look familar, but will be dark, barren and full of bums and prostitutes. Others, such as the humble Saint's Row, have been completely taken over! Seems like at least 20 years of change since 2006, though, when our old familar Stilwater was Ultor-free. Only a few list of people actually return for the sequel, but luckly, it's all the ones you would want to see return, including your best pal, Johnny Gat. Also in Stilwater are the new gangs. They also follow the same trend of having a Drug gang, a street punk gang, and a Corporate Business gang. Taking the place of the Latin Los Carnales, the Caucasian Westside Rollerz, and the Black Vice Kings are the Haitian Sons of Samedi, the Caucasian Brotherhood of Stilwater, and The Asian Ronin. The fourth, ""unofficial"" gang are the Ultor Corporation, themselves, and they run pretty much everything in new Stilwater, including all of the police. The Ronin are probably the deadliest gang, as they all carry katana blades and chase after you on high speed motorcyles, which comes off as a lot more vicious and scary than the standard street car pursuits the other gangs do. I won't say too much, but there's a little bit of ""Kill Bill"" as you progress through the Ronin storyline. They're definitely the best to take on out of the three. The Brotherhood of Stilwater are basically just giant-sized bullies. They're all very large people with even bigger vechiles. They like violence just for the sake of it. The weakest gang has to be the Sons of Samedi. Bascially, all they do is sell ""Loa Dust"" (a kind of cocaine you smoke out of broken lightbulbs!) to college students. They're all very easy to take out and all of their vechiles are pretty weak. With these new gangs though, comes new vehicles, such as bikes, boats, and planes. They're all just about as cool, if not better than the selection in GTA: San Andreas. There are also plenty of new cars, including three new ones that put classics like the Zenith and the Attrazione to shame. Even though they're now a lot more common in a Stilwater that caters to the heartless and corporate republican Upper Class, you'll probably want the three new luxury/sport cars even more. They are the 'Hayate Z70', the Ronin's offical car, the 'Bezier', which is like a MUCH better Attrazione, and the 'Superiore', which is like a Lamborghini Countach. Just don't own more than two of each or else, you'll ruin their rareness of owning them.

The graphics, which I've yet to mention, are incredible compared to the old game, and yet, still have that Saint's Row ""toony"" look to them. They almost rival GTA IV in their beautiful lighting effects and such. Saint's Row 2 now, also like GTA IV, has the ""blurring"" effect of when you go too fast in a car or quickly turn the opposite way while running. The beauty of the new Saint's Row really makes you appreciate your 360. Name-brand artists are now featured for the music. No longer any obsure, underground third-rate Hip Hop stars. Arguably, it's a better sounding soundtrack than Grand Theft Auto IV (At least in the Hip Hop department, anyway). This time, when you listen to the radio, it actually sounds like you're listening to the *real* radio, thanks to the more mainstream artists and songs. The one thind thing that sucks though, is there's only about half the number of songs on this game compared to the original. There's also no more custom playlists, either. Instead, you get your own radio station to replace your old audio player. But at least the music is from people like 50 Cent, Nas, Fat Joe, Joss Stone, and Kelis. They're not my favorites, but I know people out there like them. Unfortunately, Aisha singles are still circulating around... not much we can do about that, though. And no, Saint's Row 2 doesn't allow you to go to the Cabaret for a nice Sunday evening out, or have your character watch TV while you're watching him watch TV!

Saint's Row 2 is a bigger, better, more FUN version of the original! I'd rate it about a 4.75 out of 5! *JUST* slightly short of perfection! There are some little problems still around, like the ragdoll physics of your character, and the fact that a six foot fall can still pretty much kill them. Also, don't expect EVERYTHING to be new and wonderful! But, would you really want the game to not have ANY shades of familiarity in it at all, anyway? If you liked Saint's Row the original, then it's virtually impossible to dislike Saint's Row 2! It's very, very easy to lose coutless hours in this game with all the fun, exciting, and crazy things you can do. It's the FUN game Grand Theft Auto IV failed to give us! There are tons of enhancements and new features in the game which will make it THE game you'll still be playing a year from now! (or at least, longer than you did with that Rockstar title!)

But it works very well for my games and has a cool function called Cruise Control, you push a button and it pushes it automatically like on a car.  Very cool.  The knobs for sound and lighting are very convienient and the detachable keypad is awesome because I never used that and it frees up so much space.",positive
4109,"As I've mentioned in many Wii game reviews: I'm not a primary Wii player, and most Wii games have been pretty poor.

This game changes both!

I picked this up for my wife after she read online reviews from [...] .  I let her play for about 10 minutes, then commandered the controller for the rest of the night!

The skinny - in this game you pretty much knock stuff down, blow stuff up, and create fantastic digital messes out of blocks and balls.  It's very easy to compare to Jenga, though pulling blocks out of towers is only a portion of what this game will make you do.  Most of the time you'll be slinging bowling balls, tennis balls, baseballs, or even rubber bouncing balls at ornate and elaborate piles of blocks trying to knock down some or all of them in the quest for bronze, silver or gold medals.  A gold might require doing so in a certain period of time, or using a minimal number of throws.

The game is simply addictive beyond belief.  Most puzzles are easily accomplished, but earning Gold can be quite difficult, take multiple tries, and require lots of time to analyze.  This is far from bad however, as the thrill of discovery and success strongly outweighs any frustration by far.

Probably the most engaging part of the game is the creation mode, which allows you to build a puzzle entirely on your own.  The learning curve is very easy, and though it took me four hours to build a puzzle encompassing over 7 chain reactions, it was an absolute blast the entire time.  Folks, this is digital legos at it's FINEST.

The ONLY gripe I have is that - when building your own puzzle - you can't really advertise WHAT the purpose of the puzzle IS.  For my puzzle, my goal is to free an extra-large gem block from a humongous pile of wooden blocks with just one throw of a baseball.  It can be done, though it's anything but clear how to do it.  Now finished, I can send the puzzle through the Wii Connect internet service.  But when my friend receives the puzzle, there's no way to tell them what my goal is!  I can tell them they only have one throw, but as soon as they throw the ball, a window pops up that says ""You have met the goal"" and ends the game!  You can't even watch to see what happens.  The only way around this is to remove all requirements (such as throws or time,) and accompany the puzzle with an email or message (not sure if Wii even allows this) to explain what the challenge is.

But, that being said, I replayed my own challenge over and over again because the explosion at the end of the chain reaction was simply awe-inspiring.  The realism of the physics is quite convincing - large blocks are harder and slower to move than small blocks.  Large ""bomb"" blocks yield larger explosions than smaller blocks, etc.

With over 300 puzzles included in the game, plus the ability to create countless more, Boom Blox is a game that rewards players of all ages with hours and hours of entertaining and challenging fun.  These are the games that remind us we don't need guns and gore to entertain.

Lastly, the inclusion of multiplay opens up Boom Blox to group fun - though it should be noted that it's better as a competition than a co-op game.  Though co-op is possible in the various Jenga stages, it's simply not quite as much fun.  There's also arcade-style shooting games, but these get old very quickly.  The competition series involve bombing opponents castles with bowling balls, and is a LOT of fun, though we quickly learned that while I could sling a bowling ball into a castle with catastrophic amounts of damage, my wife couldn't seem to get as much power behind her throws, and thus was never able to keep up.  There are other competition games which require you to push your blocks into colored score zones.  These too are a lot of fun and rely more on strategy than strength.

The game also has an entertaining soundtrack of catchy arcade tunes and hilarious animal sound affects.  Get Boom Blox - I truely believe this game has something for everyone.",positive

4126,"I have never played a Diablo game before, but after playing III for several hours, it's become one of my favorite games; running around and just annihilating any mob that comes near is simply amazing. The quest system is fun, and although it's kind of strange to have a general chat but no one around, it doesn't bother me. I did not buy it to be another WoW. Thus, I only have played single player so far, so I can't opine about any multiplayer aspects. One thing I will mention is that the box is very nice. The box seems very sturdy, and has some weight to it, but not too much. The box opens up to a glossy cardboard sleeve with the install DVD inside and the serial number to register on battle.net on the outside. Underneath the sleeve are 3 Diablo III guest passes and a WoW guest pass. Also included is a nifty notepad which is underneath the passes; very nice.

OK, let's talk about the elephant in the room; the DRM. The game is tied to your battle.net account, and thus will not run without an internet connection. Folks, this is nothing we didn't already know. We've known for months that Blizzard would require a constant connection. I can, however, sympathize with the people who were unable to log in on release day. One of the reasons I waited a week to buy it. Much has been said about the ""Real Money Auction House,"" that it's the reason for the server instability. I for one really don't care about the ""RMAH,"" and I don't know anyone else who cares either. Ultimately, it is up to you to pass up this game due to the online only thing, that is your decision. I have been on 11hr plane trips, and it would be nice to kill some mobs, but if I really want to game, I can plan ahead and bring something else. The music is fantastic, and the graphics look really nice on my mid-range Radeon HD6870.",positive
4127,Great and trust worthy company. I highly recommend this product it's an awesome game. My friend Danial who hated the older final fantasies loved this one because of the battle style.

4128,great game 6 year old loves it,positive
4129,"I actually wanted to give this game a bad rating, but I just can't.  I am the opposite of the current video game trends, I love hack and slash/button mashers, I hate open world and I hate difficult.  Especially difficulty, I'll never understand why dying over and over again is fun to people.  I want to feel powerful in a game, high difficulty is the opposite of that.  Life itself is difficult and I am powerless, why do I want the same in a video game?

I digress, but what I just described is exactly what God of War USED to be.  It is now more difficult, it is MUCH less hack and slash, and it is open world.  Everything I like about video games tells me to hate this game, especially considering that the previous games were right up my alley.  But the game is just so well put together.  Every time I die I feel like I don't like the difficulty and is too high but then it only takes me one more try to defeat who just killed me.  This means they have tweaked the difficulty just right.  I don't notice what some people are complaining about with the font being small but then again I play just 4 feet away from a 65"" TV.

Every time I feel like the game is getting boring something fun or exciting happens.  So as much as I would like to hate this game I keep playing it, and keep surprising myself when i get farther despite it being more difficult than every other entry in the series.",negative

It seemed like a game where a true artist had a lot of money and said ""I'm going to make a totally great and unique game and I don't care how much it costs or even who likes it"". Indeed no punches were pulled for the sake of commercial success, the mature rating should be taken seriously. Episode 5 is very dark and went right to the edge for me. The story is about a photographer. This is fitting, for the game has some of the best photography I've ever seen. The soundtrack is beautiful, easily the best I've ever heard. Great care was taken to put these songs and images together at the right time. The emotional impact of all this sound and vision hits hard only because I cared deeply about Max and Chloe.

4139,"There will be two parts to my review. One bad section and one good section.

The bad

This was the very last Pga tour ever to be put on a Nintendo consle which sucks big time and i'm sad and dissapointed to see that Pga tour went into a hiatus after 2015. They could at least have put a couple Pga games on the 3ds but they didn't. i liked it better when the Nintendo Gamecube was still around as all the sports were on that system, EA sports really dropped a bomb by not putting more sports on the 3ds. So the real question is are they going to make more pga tours soon?

The good

 But now for the good part of this review. I love Golf Games of any kind including the now dormat Pga tour series. Compared to Mario golf, Mario golf is better but this is still fun no matter what. The use of Motion controlls with the Wiimote makes it feel like i'm swinging a real golf club and since i can't make it to the real life golf courses this is a great substitute for me. All the feelings of a real golf course right in my own home minus the golf club of course. If your a fan of Pga tour then be sure to get this game, it's a must have for any golfer like me",neutral

I found these particularly effective at taking out enemies that you need to chase.

4160,"Resident Evil 4 is probably one of my favorite games of all time. When it came out for the Gamecube, it really was a good enough to own a Gamecube at the time because it was only available for that system when it was launched.  Most critics and gamers alike agree it's probably the most amazing Resident evil game ever. A mix of action, survival and a little scares here and there too.  For a game that is around 12 years old, it's mind-blowing how well it holds up. Will it blow you away? No. Will it keep you happy? Sure it will.

The atmosphere of this game is just fantastic. Play in the dark, play with it nice and loud. It's dark, you feel isolated and alone and the game is long and will take you some time to get through it. It's not too challenging to the point where you get frustrated and there's adjustable difficulty. This current release of Resident Evil 4 on PS4 and Xbox One includes all the bonus content from the original game obviously with the upheaval of graphics, as well as additional features that were added in later versions. The mysterious and elusive Ada Wong stars in her own side story, which fills in intriguing story gaps from Leons mission. It also includes the enticing Mercenaries mode. You can also play as Wesker, Hunk, and more iconic characters if you beat the campaign to get to all the unlockables. RE4 also boasts some of the most satisfying New Game Plus action ever, allowing players to bring their powerful arsenal, unlocked costumes, and other secret weapons into a fresh play-through.

Although I've beaten and played this game many times, I couldn't resist getting the definitive version of this game. And for 20 bucks. What's really not to like? Until we see the new Resident evil. This one will keep you happy.",positive

I like that it comes with a variable weight set and that it comes with two different size skins so that you can choose the relative size of the mouse. The logitech software allows you to change the LED color (a feature I really wish they had put on the G15) and is the final icing on the cake of this mouse. On a side note I had the original G9 and had a few issues after 7 came out a while ago. Needless to say and as always, Logitech customer support won me over by replacing the defective mouse with little hassle and sending me a new mouse.

It was very depressing to see my BMI in the ""obese"" section, but also very eye opening.  I am pleased to say that my BMI has dropped below the ""obese"" line and is gradually going down.  You can set goals for yourself and track your progress.  My personal favorites are the running, step aerobics and rhythm boxing.  I really sweat with those!  I recently was able to open up the ""free step aerobics"" which allow me to do the step aerobics while watching another channel.  The Wii remote either clicks a beat, or counts and you step on and off to the beat while watching tv.  This is a great feature!

My 12 year old son is ADHD.  I had to laugh, in the beginning, the balance board kept asking him if he was ""fidgeting?""  It really brings attention to his lack of focus.  He has been doing the balance games, which have really helped improve his focus and self control!  He is also the hoola hoop champion.

It was fun designing my Mii to look like Me.  It will be even more fun to watch my pudgy Mii lose weight.  Overall, it seems to be a lot of fun and a great motivator.  I do 10,000 steps on my pedometer every day.  If I am low on steps, I jump on the Wii Fit for 30 minutes.  The free run, or free step aerobics, you can even change the channel and watch regular tv while working out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product and have recommended it many times.  I have been losing about 1-2 lbs per week by exercising and watching what I eat.  I can't say it is all the Wii Fit, but this has helped play a part in that.",positive

4180,"I loved Rayman 1. I played it to death on PC when I was younger. Since then, I feel that Rayman had lost its true form. Not here. This game is a return to the best parts of Rayman and I highly recommend it for everyone who loves true platformers.",positive
4181,"I was afraid that after reading some of the BAD reviews, Yoshi Topsy Turvy might not be to my expectations, but it was actually above my expectations!  When Bowser attacks the egglings on Yoshi's Island, Hongo the book spirit puts Bowser inside a picture book but accidentally traps Yoshi's Island in it as well.

The spirit who opposed Hongo's idea was fired and told Yoshi the story and that Hongo might return Yoshi's Island back to normal if he got to the last page of the book.  Yoshi was very angry after hearing this so in return, the spirit gave him the power to turn the world around him.  The tilt sensor on the back of the game makes it look weird but it's truly amazing.  I've heard people complaining about how it doesn't work most of the time and that's because they didn't calibrate it correctly.  Some people might wonder how it will work when it's in the DS or GBA SP.  You can change it so it does when it turns on.  There are six chapters in the book(Excluding the two boss chapters) that each have their own spirit.  Only by meeting the spirit's needs, will you be able to pass.  The difficulty starts outs really easy and progresses so that you learn how to use the tilt sensor in different ways.  I found parts of this game very challenging including the final boss.  Each spirit has different things they like so each chapter has their own challenge.  Still, you can face other spirits in a chapter or even having a two-mission level where you have to do two objectives.  The things you have to do in the levels for the spirits are, eat apples to save egglings, get a certain number of coins, kill a certain number of enemies, beat the level in a certain time limit, beat the level without killing four or more enemies, and a spirit who sends a spinning wall of saws at you(This one has to be combined with another).  Almost any of these can be combined with another for chaotic fun.  To complete a level you have to go through the rooms and complete the objective(Or objectives) and touch the the big star(s) at the end of the level.  If you completed the objective(s), you will get a completed screen with a gold or silver happiness medal(They determine the chance of winning the mini-game.).  If you get the mini-game, you get a chance to get more coins to get extra lives.  To get the next level all you need to do is touch the big star(s) and you will automatically get it.  You only need to complete a certain number of levels and get to the big star(s) at the last level in the chapter to advance to the next chapter where you will meat a new spirit.  With the tilt mechanism you can, climb up vertical walls, roll boulders and spiked rolling enemies, change the way you fall or make Yoshi jump higher and farther, swing pendulums and ships(And things like that.), and change the tidal waves when you're in a ship or boat.  So there's a lot you can do with tilt-control.  The graphics are like the Yoshi Story graphics where the characters are 3-dimensional and the backgrounds and levels are 2-dimensional.  Even though you can beat this game within six hours, you can still go back and do the levels you couldn't beat or just start a new file(By the way, you can start up to three files.).  It's up to you whether to buy it or not.  My opinion?  Buy it, it's a great game and worth its price(I would even pay $40 for it).",negative

4184,"First off I'd like to I'd like to mention that yes $60 for just enhanced visuals is outrageous, especially for people that already owned the game.  At the same time though I am sick of seeing people saying  ""If you already own last year's version then it isn't worth it"" or something to that effect.  It's offensive to the people that actually did buy it even though they already had last year's game.  I bought it for PS3 last year and still bought this, and every time I see people say that it makes me cringe, like I'm an idiot for getting it anyway.  I may have already had it on PS3 but hadn't even played through half the game yet, so most of the game will be new to me with this version.  If you already had it and want to pay the full $60 for the enhanced visuals that is your prerogative, to each his own I say.  The problem isn't whether you owned it already, the problem is really that they shouldn't be charging full price for it, period.

With that out of the way, the visuals are spectacular and I am enjoying the game very much.  There's not much else to say, the visuals and amount of fun I'm having playing it are why I am giving it 5 stars, despite my griping.  I'm not one of those people that will rate the game based on its price because you are supposed to rate a product based on its quality not it's price.  Do I wish I could rate this based on just price so I could give it a 0, of course!",negative

Incredible graphics and physics, just the right level of difficulty - not so easy you just blitz thru it, not so hard it is frustrating - just right. I played for a month non stop (almost), one of the few games I completed without cheats. I wish there were more tracks! If there were 100 new tracks I could play this forever.

And I thought NFS-3 and carmageddon were cool! This game is a perfect hybrid of the two, but without the body count.

Cant wait for the next one ...",negative
4190,"Paper Mario is an exceptionally brilliant RPG. Although it came out 14 years ago, I finally decided to play through it and I am so glad that I did. It's just so charming! It had me hooked through the whole game. I've never played anything quite like it. Some call it a spiritual successor to Super Mario RPG, and while I can understand that, the only 2 things that they truly have in common is that they are RPG's and they are set in the Mario universe.  This game is has it's own story-line and stands on it's own.

The story begins in Princess Peach's castle, as she is throwing a party for all of the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser crashes the party and takes the Princess as well as most of the castle hostage. He fuses the Princess' castle with his castle and resides high in the sky. And thus the Story begins. Bowser has the power of the Star Rod that he stole from the 7 Star Spirits. This makes him invincible. He had his henchmen capture the Star Spirit's across the different lands and it is Mario's job to save all 7 of them.

The game is a simple turn-based RPG. You choose to attack with a jump or your hammer, use an item, or use a Star Spirit Power. As you rescue more Star Spirits, they each teach you a new Star Spirit Power. Just because the game is simple, does not mean that it is easy. It requires some dedication and strategy. As long as you have both of them, you shouldn't have many issues getting through it. I had some help from a FAQ on this very site when I was lost. Throughout the journey, Mario befriends different support characters that can be switched out at any given time, on the field or in battle. They each have their own unique traits and must be used to get around the world. For example, Kooper's shell can be used to hit switches that could not normally be reached, and Bombette can be used to blow up cracks in walls to reach new areas. These support characters do not level up as Mario does, but can be upgraded with the use of Super Blocks that you find hidden throughout the worlds.

In battle, you get Star Points for defeating enemies. For every 100 Star Points, you level up. You can then choose to upgrade your HP (Hit Points), FP (Flower Points), or BP (Badge Points.) Flower Points are the equivalent to Mana in other RPG's. They are used when performing special attacks, and must when you run out you cannot execute any special attacks until you replenish them with an item or sleeping at a Toad Inn. Badge Points are used to equip various Badges you get throughout the game. These Badges let you learn new moves or special abilities, such as being able to jump on spiked enemies without taking damage. This is where the strategy comes in, if you are having trouble with a certain boss, you can access the situation and equip different Badges to have better results in the battle.

It's so fun exploring the huge world of Paper Mario. There are many different towns full of people to talk to, and many different landscapes, ranging from a hot desert to a snowy mountain. The game has such a great vibe to it. I really enjoyed getting to know the dozens of characters I came in contact with. The game is full of charm and positivity. I especially liked exploring the Boo's Mansion! Very creepy and awesome.

The graphics are absolutely AMAZING! I was blown away playing this game on my HDTV. It still looks great to this day! The characters all look like they are hand-drawn and fully animated, like a cartoon. This game has such a wonderful art-style, and rivals games released to this day. It's simply beautiful. You'll find yourself laughing at all of the funny expressions that each character makes as you play. Words do not do these graphics justice, you must see them for yourself!

The game took me roughly 22 hours to beat. This is the first time I have sat down with an N64 game in years, but I'm so glad I did. It really makes you wonder why more RPG's weren't released on this system. This game is pretty much Nintendo's swan song of the N64, because shortly after this released, the GameCube came out. This epic system truly went out with a bang, as this game is a classic that will go down in history as one of the most charming and fun RPG's of all time. I highly encourage you to purchase this if you don't own it. The game is amazing. I found no flaws with it.",positive

4193,"This is going to be a short review. Sweet and to the point.

This game is awesome as far as scope of the world goes. The world is so massive! The creature designs as well are really cool. The story is both humerus and adult. Boobies abound if you've made it far enough into the game. Both man and female, so its equal.

The environmental designers/artist... should be proud of themselves. Everything just flows together so well..when going to new areas..

So much to do and explore. (although I would suggest, unlike myself.. actually follow the main/2ndary quest up to about level 10, because you get some much needed items) Like the item that dispels illusions. Much needed before you go hunting loot. Several witcher quest and treasure quest where this item came in handy.

The combat mechanics and the exploration mechanics of your character leave something to be strongly desired though. A fluidity of movement, and precision to be exact. I feel like I'm trying to control a drunk fish at times. And quiet honestly that's very frustrating. For instance a game that's gotten this more accurate would be the Newest Lara croft remake.

Also the inventory system... leaves something to be desired as far as just needing a basic organization option.

But besides those two things, which honestly are minor, because they work good enough to not always lead to your defeat...

This game, really blows everything out of the water I have had the chance to experience in a long time. Just because all the elements of the game fit together so well. Heck I would go as far to say, that this is my new all time favorite game. No exaggerations needed.

Great job 'CD Projekt RED,' You've raised the standards on games as a whole with 'The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.'",positive

4195,"If you have an entertainment center where you prefer not to have wires spilling out the front, this is the perfect product for your PS3. It conveniently (and quickly) charges two PS3 controllers at once.

The Good:
1) Power Source: It's handy to be able to plug this into the wall instead of the PS3 via a USB cable. You don't have to have that wire hanging off the front of the unit all the time, which kept the glass door on the front of my entertainment center from closing.
2) Charge Adapter: The previous model of this product was poorly designed to the extent that it was maddening to insert the controller on the base.  You had to gently wiggle the controller to fit a slightly crooked five-pin USB connector.  This resulted in scratched controllers and lost tempers.  This design, however, fixed this issue and included adapters that you connect to the controller before dropping it in the charger.  It's easy to use and the bright red-green lights indicate when charging is complete.

The Bad:
1) Design: It can no longer charge up to four controllers at once, but this should really only factor into your decision if you're constantly playing multi-players.

Overall:
To me, it's worth it because of the slim design, the wall-power source, and the convenience of being able to charge two controllers at once.  And, perhaps most importantly, gone is the annoying five-pin slot that made the previous model so annoying!",positive
4196,"The best Hack/Slash game ever! the game is simply fun. The movements look fluid. In fact I have been again more than 50 enemies at once, doing lots of combos with all 4 girls at the same time and there is no lag in the battle as it occurs with some many games when they are too many characters at once in a battle. Fast paced action. Fan Service. Simply entertaining story. Even if you have not played the previous games (like me) you do understand the story, and the game gives you some background anyway. Lots of customization for all girls. I already have the platinum trophy and I still keep playing the game. You can set the audio to Japanese which is a plus. The art gallery that is unlock in-game is great.
And the banana split edition comes with a lot of great stuff, the best being the physical artbook that comes in this edition. You should  pick the banana edition, its worth the money.",positive

4198,"As a longtime and lifelong fan of the ""Myst"" games, I was thrilled and a bit worried about the thrid installment in this line. Cyan, previous creators of Myst and Riven, weren't ultimately responsible for the third, and I wondered if some quality would be sacrificed by UBI Soft.
Fear not. Myst 3: Exile not only lives up to the high standard set by Myst and Riven, it even supersedes these games, mainly due to technoligical development that allows a better gaming experience.
As it turns out, Cyan had a hand in helping to develop the next game, so all the special things I loved about the first two were preserved: the timelessness, challenging puzzles, not truly knowing what you are doing until you start to mentally putting things together. It's all there, and more.
The graphics in Myst 3 are stunning, and the 360 degree viewing options really add to the realism. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible and add tension or peacefulness to the tasks on hand. I appreciate how the story progresses along as you solve each puzzle, with great video clips and graphics to boot. While I'm not done with the game yet, I have finished solving the puzzles on one island, and the final solution led to such an incredible suprising event I screamed with joy at what was occuring, at 11 PM at night, mind you!
I've had a few technological gliches with this game, but nothing major. I've been running it on my iBook with few problems. I'd had a couple of stalled scenes, but never a freeze or loss of information.
Overall, this game earns its five stars, and I welcome back Atrus and Catherine into our lives. I'm eagerly anticipating UBI Soft to start producing Myst 4.",positive

4207,"This is by far, the best screen protector I've seen/used so far. What's great about it is the fact that it covers the entire front side of the PS Vita, not just the image area; a big plus for me. This protector serves its purpose, but more than that, it gives you huge peace of mind. I had been wiping my vita all week long since I got it, and couldn't wait for this screen protector to arrive. My vita does not have any image distortion, glare or colour hue, this protector is 100% clear. Also, and this is important, the touch screen didn't loose any sensitivity, it works just like before installing the protector.

A few tips: first and foremost, clean the Vita, and I  mean, CLEAN it until it shines, let no dust, lint or finger print on it, because once the protector is on, it'll stay on; you can remove it, but good luck getting a clean surface after that. I should mention though that I did not  use the supplied cloth, if you have a lint free cloth, the type used for sunglasses,etc, the better.
Second, the instructions, step 2, where it says ""remove the yellow sheet"", remove ONLY THE YELLOW PIECE OF PAPER, be careful not to remove it with the tape it is attached to; you will need that piece of tape to hold the protector in place (after you line it up) to the vita's upper edge. Once the tape is secured to the vita, you will then start the main process of pulling the first plastic off the protector. The edges are very easy, simply pull the smaller tabs upwards.
You may get a bubble or two, but mostly on the edges, do yourself a favor, do not use the supplied ""card"", it is a joke. Use a credit card, but be gentle, remember you are pressing against the vita's screen; I wrapped the credit card edge with the same cloth I used to clean the vita.
All in all, an excellent product.",positive

4210,"You know, I passed on this game. I loved Assassins Creed, Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood and was excited when I saw this was coming out - but - I read other reviews and thought, ""why spend the $59+ for an 'alright' game?"" And, believe me, at that time I was desperate for a new game to play but I was tired of the structured plots and action of CoD and the rest and a little disappointed with the games I had picked up recently (Fallout New Vegas being the exception). I wanted a sandbox to play in. But still, I passed on Revelations. And then, my lovely wife saw it in the store, knew I loved the Assassins Creed series and gave it to me as a present. Hallelujah! I love it! I don't know what these other reviewers are expecting, maybe everyone it just pretty jaded at this point, but I absolutely love it. This is a beautiful game. It's colorful, it's wide open, it's Assassins Creed the next evolution.
I try to play all of the game: the side missions, developing new assassins, completing the skill requirements for the guilds, Desmond's memory blocks, whatever I can find. Man, I've been drilling this thing hard for over a week and still don't see the end in sight. My wife is sorry she gave it to me, calls herself a PS3 widow, but I thank her for it every time I hit the ON button.
I have a hard suspicion that some of the negatives come from other game developers which is a tactic I consider to be lower than whale feces, and that's on the bottom of the Pacific, jack. You know, there's enough demand for GOOD games out there for everyone and if you can't do as well or better then get off the f*****g merry-go-round. And that goes for regular reviewers also. If it is totally bad, say so, but if you just want to nitpick the thing to death then come up with something better or shut your pie hole and get a life. Stop ruining it for others just because you can.
OK, I've had my rant. Fat lot of good it will do, but it's said.
If you haven't picked up Revelations, do so. You won't be sorry unless you're one of these other bung holes that whine about everything. It is a great game.
Thank you, Sweetie.",neutral

4221,"With its low requirements and amazingly quick pace Starcraft (and Bw) are IMO the best computer games ever. With Starcraft, you have three races of equal abilities and power but are completely different.
Bw adds to the mix with 6 new units, (Valkyries, Medics [Terran], Devourer's and Lurker's [Zerg], as well as Dark Archon's and Corsair's [Protoss]). On top of that, the Protoss can now access Dark Templar's (though their stats aren't really worth the price and tech) and both Zerg and Terran have new upgrades. BW also includes three new tilesets and three new critters (YAY!)
The races are still even, regardless of what you may have read in some other reviews. Also, all the new units are useful, IMO, except the Dark Archon and Templar (but I'm not a very avid Toss player). Medics make fields of marines and firebats that much more of an annoyance, whereas lurkers will cut infantry down in seconds. Corsairs are quick to fire and good against smaller groups (and their disruption web is awesome when playing a terran tanker), whereas the Valkyrie is amazing for, say tons of Mutas. And the devourers spores help slow down the enemy fire.
With the new upgrades Guardians become less a threat than they previously were to Terrans, and Ultralisk's are muuuch more useful.
The only thing that wasn't improved was the campaign. The story was close to the last, and you could tell who the traitor was and who would die etc. The cutscenes aren't even that great either. And by the end you're left with so few characters, that you find yourself not caring anymore, and wanting Kerrigan to destroy all of them. But the never tiring multiplayer saves the game. And even though there weren't too many new good 8player maps, we still have hunters!
Other than that though, awesome game, and I sure can't wait until Blizzard releases news about Starcraft 2! (If they do:D)",positive

4229,"First off I wanted to say that the limited edition of this product is a great deal and that more games should have limited editions that come this way. I would highly recommend this game to anybody who is a hardcore JRPG/RPG gamer. Its very challenging on both difficulty levels and won't hold your hand. I'm going to give you a few reason why I believe this games deserves a 5 star rating. The gameplay, The gameplay is immersive! grinding and fusing different types of demons together to make new ones is a site to be seen. the interaction with the demons in the dungeon is funny and rewarding. you can take their money away from them witch in the game is called ""mecca"" or talk to them to have them become apart of your party. In game battles are challenging you have to make sure your on your A game cause the foes won't go easy on you. you wear a gauntlet on your arm that can speak to you its called ""Burroughs"" its a spirit that speaks to you and that will help you along your mission by telling you quest missions your side missions and everything to navigate through the game successfully. in your menu you have ""Apps"" yes apps you can buy and download apps to your gauntlet and use them for battle upgrades (gaining more mecca from demons / being able to see the enemies weakness/or being able to better negotiate with them so they can join your party/ etc ) as you can see the game offers a very deep combat system (when in battle its all in first person no seeing your party members on screen like in FF or chrono trigger its still great but something you have to get use to) . you also have side quest you can do that will appear in K's tavern on whats called the ""Black board"" you can use your Burroughs to access these side quest witch adds more replay value to the game. off of the main quest some mission will have you get different types of items and bring them back and you'll get a weapon or armor upgrade etc. navigating through the kingdom of mikado will be done so by menus Vs walking around. This game has many levels and endless amount of content to offer with being able to fuse the demons you get plus with the different dudgeons and the story line your easily looking at a 60+ hour gaming experience. if you like persona 4 then you should feel right at home here. the only negative things i can say that really don't take away from the game for me is that in the dungeon you won't have a way point or map that tells you where everything is (the legends of zelda/ dark cloud) you'll get a map but it won't tell you where special items are (could change later in the game as of this review its not nothing like that so far)  witch some might not like but for me its fine cause I want a challenge and not a easy JRPG/RPG. Overall I really love this game and know I'm going to have a blast as I keep playing it from the dialogue, the demon fusing, and atmosphere I have no complaints. do yourself a favor and don't think twice about purchasing this outstanding game.

4231,"i have all the PS1 spyro games, and i love them the newer games not so much. This is one of my favorite PS1 series of games, and i'd recommend all of these games to anyone in a heartbeat. This is a family friendly title, and a good game to own. Some of the game was a little challenging for me at first. i remember the ads, and wanting to have this game and the un-wasted excitement when i finally held the case in my hands.

Spyro is the main character(obviously) a little purple dragon with Sparx(a dragonfly and his best friend) following him around, Sparx represents Spyro's health and proctects Spyro. He can only take so many hits or damage spyro should of recieved before Spyro is on his own and can only get hit once, to avoid this however you can ram or flame the sheep(called fodder) and they will turn into butterflies which Sparx eats in one bite for a life. The mission of the game is to free your fellow dragons who were all turned to crystal statues(Spyro wasn't tall enough to get hit by the spell), get the eggs and dragon treasure back, and beat Gnasty Gnorc who hates dragons and besides turning them into statues stole all the dragon treasure and the dragon eggs.",positive

4233,"This review should really be in two parts, let me start with this. Of all other bundles if you have not played any of those games then I do not recommend this bundle for one simple reason. DESTINY SUCKS

Playstation: Great looking playstation, super sleek plus as the newer version you save power and all the other fancy things. Easy to rate as it is just a system that works, 5/5 stars

Destiny: This game has some great things going for it but one huge flaw (which I'm sure many already know about) there is NO story in the game at all. The story of this game is on Bungies website in cryptic poems. At no point do you really feel like you know what is going on or why you are doing what you are doing. I could go on but I'll save that for a Destiny review

Shooting; 5/5 super tight shooter, extremely fun and is what keeps you coming back
Grapics; 5/5 locked at 30fps which everyone agrees is beautiful excluding PC gamers, lighting is amazing with shadows that make the shooting aspects work even better
Story; 0/5 literally what makes a game a game is not even existant in the game without some digging and really reading into things. this is what makes what easily could have been a great game a terrible waste of money",positive
4234,"I'll start by saying this is one of the best games I have ever played. From the opening scene in the game, I was hooked.

Story: Set in an alternate reality, Andrew Ryan builds an underwater city called Rapture. He wanted a city to be free from the laws of the land and to push the scientific boundaries without ethical interference, so he builds the city on the ocean floor in the Atlantic using geothermal power from underwater volcanoes. One scientist discovers stem cells from a slug could be used to create ""Adam,"" a plasmid that alters DNA and grants the user special power. All of the citizens of Rapture become crazy and hooked on Adam and the plasmids and want more. In order to create enough Adam, these slugs were injected into the stomachs of little girls (called little sisters) to produce large quantities of Adam. A plasmid industry was then created to sell plasmids to citizens. Soon a war broke out between Andrew Ryan and a gangster named Frank Fontaine who wanted control of Rapture. Andrew Ryan appears to defeat Fontaine and seizes control of the plasmid industry. Fontaine's soldiers (called Splicers) continue to attack the little sisters so Ryan creates plasmid-enhanced super soldiers called Big Daddies in order to protect the little sisters.

Gameplay: First-person shooter. You are Jack, a plane crash survivor in the ocean, and you seek shelter in a lighthouse. You find out the lighthouse is actually a bathysphere that transports you down to the underwater city of Rapture. You are guided through the city by Radio from a guy named Atlas. He teaches you how to survive and instructs you to inject a plasmid into yourself. You then battle through Rapture killing the Splicers along the way to your goals. You have multiple weapons to use including a wrench, pistol, machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, etc. and multiple plasmids that let you use fire, ice, electricity, telekinesis, insects, etc. to damage opponents. As you make your way through Rapture, there are multiple vending machines used to purchase ammunition, health and equipment, create items, adjust plasmids, etc. There are cameras in some areas that scan and try and spot you. If you are spotted, bots are released that can shoot bullets at you. In order to get past cameras, you can hack them or destroy them. Hacking is a big part of the game. Every electronic in the game can be hacked such as the vending machines, health stations, safes, cameras, bots, and automated turrets. Hacking cameras, bots and automated turrets changes them to your side where they will attack enemies for you. Hacking health stations and vending machines lowers the price of items and add new ones. When you hack something, you play a short mini game similar to Pipe Mania, where you try and get the flow of the liquid from the start point to the end point without setting off alarms. Several items make hacking easier, such as slowing the liquid, less alarm tiles, etc. As you make your way through Rapture, you will need to acquire more Adam in order to buy more plasmids or upgrade them. You get Adam via the little sisters but you have to kill their big daddy first. Big daddies are tougher to kill than Splicers. Once they are gone, you can harvest Adam from the little sisters. You have the option to be good and save the little sisters (keep them alive and free them from the slug) or kill them and harvest every bit of Adam from them down to the slug. Your ending depends on your choices with the little sisters. You get more Adam by killing them but you get bonus presents from the little sisters for every 3 that you save. It adds up to be about the same either way. Another item in the game is the research camera and film. You can take photos of each enemy, exposing weak points. Once you take enough photos of each enemy type, you will get the maximum benefit and they will be easier to kill. It takes several of each enemy to get enough photos. This works on big daddies, cameras, bots, turrets, etc.

Graphics: Amazing views of the ocean and ocean life. The details are incredible and the animations look very vivid and life-like.

Sound: The game is set in the 60's so you often hear 60's music and sound. The voice acting is good and the sound effects are realistic for every weapon and plasmid.

Conclusion: All of the game play aspects add up to an amazing experience. I have played through the game multiple times and it is still a blast to play. Definitely one of the most defining games of the seventh generation of video game consoles and one of my favorite games of all times.",neutral
4235,"I bought this game around Thanksgiving time.  I hadn't purchased XBox Live at that time so I was playing the standard 1 player mission based game.  The game has simple flight controls in which a monkey could operate with ease.  Crimson Skies is not a flight simulator.  The 1 player game flows like any mission-based shooter and quite frankly, gets stale rather quick.  The missions are destroy this, escort that, etc.  Fun, yet repetitive after a while.  Whenever you take out enemies, you collect their money.  Money is used to upgrade the different planes you commandeer.  Stealing new planes and comparing the differences in handling speed and firepower is fun.  The game's environments are huge and have hidden icons buried throughout, giving the single player reason to explore.  These icons are used for upgrading planes as well.  All this said about the 1 player game, I give it a 7 out of 10.  I only played it for about a week (25% complete 1 player) when I purchased Live.
**Open doors**
Crimson Skies on Live is utterly amazing and gave me no reason to return to the 1 player mode.  Modes such as Dogfight, Team DF, Capture the Flag, are all great.  16 players are allowed to join in one game (with a little lag, but not much at all).
It is on XBox Live that Crimson Skies allows you to see the vast handling and maneuverability of these planes.  Live also keeps each pilot's stats, allowing the player to put everything in perspective compared to other Red Baron's out there.
The environments on Crimson Live are completely huge and amazing and the battles that ensue are nothing short of utter mayham.
I give Crimson Live 9/10 dumbfire rockets.  If you are looking for a reason to purchase Live, look no further.  This game to me, was worth the money.

I have been a fan of Nintendo since I was a little kid but I never tried Mario Kart until the Nintendo64 and it was a blast. Mario Kart for the Wii has several new features from Mario Kart 64, most notably being the unlockable characters.

I'm not sure if it is just myself, but I do have a lot harder time sliding on the Wii version of the game than on the 64 version. I don't know if I have just gotten rusty, but I remember when I used to play the 64 that it was a lot easier to slide around corners. Now I usually just do automatic on the Wii.

I also have a second PSP and duel wirelessly against people constantly. I actually bought a second PSP and a second copy of this game, it's that good! You can have up to 8 customized decks to choose from before a duel, you can use side decks, it is very responsive and very entertaining.

4247,"This unit will charge up to 4 controllers at the same time - 2 on each side - and each side is turned on by a switch in front.  If you don't press the switch, which activates a blue light, then the chargers won't work.  Initially I missed that and thought 2 of the chargers weren't working.  Since I still have the charging cord, I can actually attach an additional controller, therefore I can have 5 controllers charging at the same time.  The thing I like about keeping the charging cord around - you can see if the controller is fully charged by looking at the front of the controller.  That's the only drawback to putting the controllers face down - you can't see the front of them which shows yellow when they aren't fully charged.

I did find a minor issue in that you must be very careful to ensure the controllers are properly seeded so that they charge in the slots where you can do that.  Else, you will discover that you've got uncharged controllers.  However, once you get used to how they fit in the slots, it's easily checked.
I really like the fan as there are occasions where I play for 5-6 hours at a time and that can cause quite a bit of heat to build up, especially if you keep your console in an entertainment center, or up against a wall.  I noticed that the audio would go out in some games if the console was on for 5-6 hours at a time, and it no longer is an issue now that I'm using this unit.

I also like having the unit standing on it's side.  It gives me more room in my entertainment center.

The unit will turn on/off in conjunction with the rest mode - if it turns on to charge, the cooling fans/charging station will also turn on.  Therefore, it's very noticeable if the PS4 turns itself on.

There is a small blue light in the front of the unit on each side which makes it obvious to notice when each side is on, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the fans quieter than I expected.

A wise purchase for the frequent PS4 user.",positive
4248,"Let's face it, Rock Band is pretty expensive in the first place. There are tons of addons to blow your money on, whether new drumsticks or guitar straps. Most of them add little to nothing to the experience. Pedal Metal is definitely an exception to this rule.

I purchased Pedal Metal before having any problems with my pedal unit. After having played Rock Band at a friend's who had installed Pedal Metal out of necessity, I couldn't go back to the plastic pedal. The easy-to-install metal cover adds substance to the pedal, making it feel less like a toy and leaving me worry-free as to whether the pedal will eventually snap (I can be a little brutal).

To be honest, I think any Pedal Metal unit will do. I gave in and bought this unit which was an additional few bucks for a better hinge and a cover for the lower portion of the pedal. I don't think the addition made it substantially better.

Overall, an excellent purchase and something every Rock Band owner should invest in. This coming from a guy who saves every dollar to buy more addon songs!",positive

4252,"I chose the Corsair K70 RGB with Cherry MX Brown Switches to be my very first mechanical keyboard!

Brown switches are in between Red and Blue's - Same actuation force as reds, but with a responsive feel, like the blue's, just not as exaggerated.

This keyboard has such a great feel to it. Allow me to list some of the pro's.

Pros
-Aluminum body (Typing on this sounds amazing compared to plastic and it has a nice weight to it.)

-Braided USB Cable (Keep in mind, if you plug it into a USB 3.0 port, you will only need to plug one in - I believe the one with the picture of a keyboard on it.)

-RGB Lights look wonderful on this! You can customize it any way you want using the software.

-Any key can be made into a macro (I haven't tried this feature yet.)

-Media keys and a great volume scroller!

Cons - It's very hard to say this, but let's get it over with...

-The software is confusing. If you're going for the default light settings (Basic, Rainbow, etc.) you will have no issue, but if you're trying to customize it, then be prepared to spend an hour or more trying to understand how to create it, or watch videos on it. Hey, it's a learning process, not a huge con.

-The aluminum body does attract dust, but please do not let this factor into your choice. This keyboard is definitely a quality keyboard.

-No USB Pass through. (Not a big deal to me, honestly, but it may be for others.)

-Lights are not too visible when the area is bright.

**With all this being said, allow me to also say this**

I tried the Corsair Strafe RGB, it does not feel as nice as the K70 RGB - The Strafe is made out of quality plastic, with a good weight to it, but the keys feel odd and the noises it makes just aren't as satisfying to me. I won't fully go into details, as this review is for the K70, but if you want a light show, then go for the Strafe RGB, as the lights are way more visible when the room is bright. If you want quality and a great feel, go for the K70. All personal preference, of course.

Honestly, I would love to review more Mechanical Keyboards, but I don't exactly have the funds for them.

Overall, before buying test out which Cherry MX switch is right for you!

4255,"I see a lot of reviews complaining about how fragile these are. Well, it's quite the opposite in my case. Let me elaborate; as a cruise ship employee, I travel a lot. Planes, ships, cars, buses you name it, I've done it. That doesn't just include traveling to and from the ship - oh, no. We cruise ship workers live in ports of call - wherever there's a free (or inexpensive) wi-fi, you will find a lot of us. And as an avid gamer, I always carry my trusty laptop to download newest purchase from Steam.

So, between playing games and talking with my family on Skype, I use these a lot and they spend quite a lot of time cramped in my bag with the rest of my laptop, power brick and gaming mouse and a few other things (power outlet converters for EU, UK and Italy etc). After years of such transportation, they're still fully working without a single issue. With Win7 and 8 you don't even need drivers for these - they will be recognized natively and work straight out of the box.

And oh yeah - I NEVER disconnected them safely from USB port ;)

4260,"Final Fantasy VII was the game that made me want a PlayStation 1. I played Final Fantasy VII briefly after it was initially released at a friend's house, then my own copies later in college on both the PC and PlayStation 1. So when I ordered a PlayStation Portable (PSP) recently it seemed like a no-brainer to pick up a copy of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII as one of my first games.

Having previously played and enjoyed the Kingdom Hearts games for the PlayStation 2, this game was the perfect choice for my first PSP game, and is the major reason I'm extremely glad I didn't pick up a PSPgo, and will continue to keep my PSP-3000 for as long as it works.

Crisis Core tells the events that lead up to Final Fantasy VII (in fact ending with the opening of FF7), and I'll admit the story is pretty moving (Lost Odyssey was the last game to make me tear-up, and I didn't cry during FF7). The gameplay will be quite familar if you've played the PlayStation 2 Kingdom Hearts games, featuring a mix of real-time battles with RPG elements. Depending upon your preference for such things, it offers various simplified elements, such as the shop and leveling, which I think works fairly well.

The game plays great on the PSP, offering fairly tight controls (movement via either the d-pad or stick), with great sound and video (as usual with Square (Enix), the CG videos are top-notch and they look great on the PSP).

The game is UMD-only, and there seem to be no plans to make it available electronically. Compared to the other UMD game I've thus far played, Star Ocean: First Departure, the UMD seems to be read from fairly frequently, but loading times are fairly quick, and it's something that you can easily ignore.

To completion, with a number of optional missions finished, I put in a little over 27 hours into the game, and will definitely be putting more hours in to get near 100% on the optional missions, and perhaps even another playthrough (via new game plus).

On the default difficulty I died once or twice (excluding those times a Phoenix Down kept me going), and those were more from stupidity then anything else. Generally, I'd say the game is fairly easy, with some fights a little more difficult than others. Unlike Final Fantasy VII it seems to be a little easier to be a completionist in this game, but since the main area is pretty spread out, those of this type might get a little bored walking back and forth (unless they're following a guide).

I give the game 5 stars of 5, as I found the game to be extremely enjoyable, and the amount of time put into it currently, and in the future, is vastly more than the price of entry.

Recommended for fans of Final Fantasy VII, as well as those who enjoyed Kingdom Hearts on the PlayStation 2.",negative

4267,"This game is the sequel to Etrian Odyssey, one of the most difficult games I have played in years.  Here's the rundown: you create a team of adventurers, and explore the labyrinth found within the giant tree your town is built around.  The plot is stays simple, but it's more of a plot than the first game had, and it's enough to give you a reason to keep going.

Basically, you map out the many levels of the labyrinth. fight monsters, gather treasure, create new weapons, level up, etc.  Just beware: this game gets very hard, very fast.  Within a single battle, your heroes can quickly be brought from ""top fighting form, we can take on anything!"" to ""low on health, low on tech points, and oh god I forgot to buy warp wire and there's a FOE between me and the way back!""

But if you played the original, you knew that already.  In fact, I'm going to assume you've played the original and finish this up with some pros and cons between the two games:

PRO:
-The new auto button.  In the last game, trudging through the lower levels was a chore, because you had to keep mashing on the A button to get through battles with weak enemies that can't possibly pose a threat anymore.  Now you just hit L, and watch as you party makes short work of the enemy.
-Improved mapping.  More icons and the ability to stick more of them on the map really improves the experience.
-More characters.  This gives you much more flexibility in forming a party, because you no longer absolutely NEED to use certain characters.

CON:
-FOEs no longer give experience.  This means that not only are you out a valuable source of experience, but also that the developers could stick more of them on each level!  And there's nothing quite like defeating the boss of the previous stratum, only to have your entire party wiped out in one hit by a FOE on the next level.
-The auto button.  Yes, I also listed that as a pro, but you'll be tempted to abuse it, and it WILL kill you.  Either you'll take too long and a FOE will stumble across your battle, you'll take too long and discover that one enemy can summon a stronger monster, or (most frequently) the enemies will use a status-affecting ability and by the time you've canceled the auto-battle your healer and primary damage-dealer will be out of action, and all you can do is desperately try to revive your healer or escape as one by one the rest of your party is KO'd.

It's a hard game, no question.  But it's also fun, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge.",negative

You are a miner, mistreated by the guards of the facility and have taken the last straw so the flag of revolt is raised and fighting ensues.

The DS version of the game is in my opinion the best version of the game so far. It includes all of the cinema scenes created for the Playstation version, without the slow-down when entering the menus that the Playstation version suffered from. It also has several new areas to keep things interesting for us Chrono Trigger veterans (though those new areas aren't nearly as good as the original material), a couple of which answer some of the questions left by Chrono Trigger's very confusing sequel, Chrono Cross.

4276,"the question on everyone's mind was....is Halo 3: ODST worth the $60 price tag? for people who already own the original Halo 3, this will be overpriced for you unless you don't own any of the Halo 3 multiplayer map packs.  if you do own the original halo 3 and all the map packs i suggest you try to find someone selling the odst on ebay or craigslist or try buyin it used somewhere.

lets do the math on the contents of halo 3: odst:
-the full halo 3 multiplayer experience on a separate disc $15 (half the price of halo 3 full version)
-all of the halo 3 multiplayer map packs and 3 new maps unreleased which price at almost $40
-ODST campaign and firefight experience $30
-Free Sgt Johnson download for preorders
-Free Halo: Reach beta invitation
that puts the total at $85 and i payed $60 so i got my moneys worth!

i felt the campaign for odst was short in comparison to its brother halo 3...depending on difficulty, it can be anywhere between 5-10 hours of gameplay...i beat the campaign on normal in 5 hours solo play and around 11 hours solo on legendary.

you start off as a rookie in an odst unit...while during drop you get separated from your squad and this is where you begin the story tryin to maneuver through new mombasa finding clues into where the rest of your squad is.  as you unravel another clue to another one of your squadmates you get to play a level as one of the other sqaud mates--the level is all the events the squad mate endured between the drop and up to the point where you found the clue.  the clues are also beacons which help download data to your visr and intel.  with out spoiling the whole campaign, you pretty much find your self fighting covenant, finding audio logs and clues, and tryin to rejoin up with your squad while at the same time diggin more into the story of halo 3.

this game plays alot more tactical and different then the orginal halo 3 because yoru not master chief no more.  you have to find med packs in the game to regain health and theres some new weapons introduced and some old weapons that aren't offered in the game i.e. br assault rifle w/scope.

the firefight mode is similiar to horde on gears of war.  you fight off reinforcements of enemies through multiple round.  where you and your team share a collective of lives.  during certain stages certain skulls are activated/deactivated/combined to make the game more interesting and difficult.  between rounds there are bonus rounds where you can't lose lives but you can get some juicy points by killin as many covenant as possible in a 60 second period..as of right now there is no matchmaking for firefight, but the reason it was left out was because it was going to push the release date six months so they released the game and will release an update later.

4285,"I can make this decision really easy for you if you've played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Knights-of-the-Old-Republic/dp/B00006IR62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</a>.  Did you love the game, and one of your favorite part being the intensive dialogue and the ability to influence characters by your comments (and the really funny ones), and you could basically be a good/bad person?  Where you had to do things to impress your companions to get more quests?  Did you love the battle system of having three other companions with you at any time, and the battle system?  If you said yes to all of that, then there is no reason to read any further.  These are both amazing BioWare games, and if you loved KOTOR, you will love this.  This is very similar, except it's dragons instead of Star Wars.

The only PS3 RPG game that rivals this one is obviously the Elder Scrolls, and Fallout if you wish to include that, but those are vastly different types of RPGS.  Dragon Age has more of an old-school vibe to it, and I love that.  If you love classic RPGs, you should love this.  It has everything a true RPGer wants - a vastly open world to explore with tons of interesting quests, captivating storyline (some RPG storylines are just so cliche and boring), interesting companions, witty and funny dialogue with your companions and NPCs, the ability to make choices that effect your entire future in the game, a pretty good battle system, etc.  I'll help break it down for you.

GRAPHICS - do not buy this game for the graphics.  The new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdoms-of-Amalur-Reckoning/dp/B0044SA734/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a>&nbsp;is actually very much an RPG (or RPG/action, but it definitely feels more like an RPG) has amazing graphics, so if you're looking to buy a new RPG and are worried about getting awesome graphics, you may wish to look at that or Skyrim.  Dragon Age Origins has graphics similar to the PS2.  They are definitely nothing to write home about.  The cutscenes are decent and personal dialogue with players, but when walking around, everything looks a bit clunky and old-school.  The game is plenty good enough though to make up for that.  The graphics remind me a LOT of KOTOR.

BATTLE SYSTEM - some complain that this is just basically a button mashing game.  Well, yes and no.  It's not that simple.  You need to get your queue in order for spells/abilities you wish to cast, strategize accordingly, and even modify what the other characters are doing if necessary.  Button mashing is plausible on easy mode, but for anything harder you're going to have to strategize a bit more.  Once again, it's very, very similar to KOTOR.

You get to have three characters with you at all times (like KOTOR again).  It's always frustrating to me to have to choose, because I want to hear what they all have to say.  But who you bring with you makes a huge impact.  You need a tank, a healer, and a heavy damage dealer in your party, and whatever you're doing yourself.  This is not turn-based RPG; you just walk into enemies and start fighting.  Most RPGs are very much moving away from turn-based style, and I like that for the most part.

COMPANIONS - the companions in this game are hilarious and fun, and that's why I wish I could have more than three with me (the whole party in non-fighting areas would be nice, and then only three others in mob areas).  Like KOTOR, some of your companions are so kind and lovely, while others are well....pretty evil.  Your actions in your quests and dialogue, even with NPCS, will often effect your companions feelings towards you (example - there is a pretty evil woman companion who you get positive influence on when you do evil things).  If you upset certain companions too much about touchy issues, they might even leave your party.  Whenever you're walking around town, every now and then two of your companions will start talking to each other about random stuff, and it's usually quite funny and entertaining.  The writers are very clever.  You can get characters to like or hate you through your interactions with them, others, and your own actions.  You can also give them gifts to make them like you, which I think is pretty neat.  When a character likes you enough, they often teach you new abilities or have their own special sidequest now available to you.  You even have the option to form romantic/sexual relationships with some of your companions, whether or not you're a guy or girl.

STORYLINE - while some storylines in RPGs bore the hell out of me and I have to focus hard so I don't tune out, this one is pretty interesting.  One of the neatest parts of this game is the beginning, when you get to choose who and what you want to be.  Depending on that, you'll have different different opening storylines.  Although you end up in the same spot quite soon eventually, it's really cool to be able to go back and check out the different places you could have started out at.  For instance, I was a mage, so I started in the Circle of Magi (like a mage school - well, sort of).  Since your opinions actually change the destiny of the game, paying attention to storylines is pretty important.  But with the cleverly written dialogue and storylines, you shouldn't have a hard time paying attention.  Like most RPGs, the game IS very dialogue intensive.  But if you're an RPGer, I don't see why that would bother you.

CONS:
EA really milked downloadable content for everything they could.  It's kind of annoying when you buy an expensive game when it's first released, and then you're expected to keep paying for more and more content, some of which is very vital to the game.

The graphics are not spectacular by any means.  They are simply mediocre.

That is really all I can think of at the moment.  I never had the game freeze-up, and that's a constant, annoying hassle in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls and Fallout (love them to death, but they are buggy).  BioWare knows how to make a STELLAR RPG.  It is a severe disappointment that its predecessor could not even come close to being as good as this one.  I think BioWare's real developers left for awhile and let interns take over or something.  The graphics are a definite improvement in the second one, but everything else is worse - so what's the point?

Anyway, if you have any love for RPGs, this is a game you should get right away.",positive

4287,"The game that started it all is reinvented in Emperor.  Even though the name and general play of the game is fairly identical to the classic Dune, the houses hand plot have both advanced to their own level.  Each house has its distinct advantages and disadvantages.  Units are balanced well so that many different stratiges may arise.  The rush strategy, which pretty much killed any real stragety in Starcraft, is completley useless in Dune.  I've seen wave upon wave of units die at my defenses and only those that are cunning enough actually make it through.
An Excellent game with an excellent story backed up by great gameplay and graphics and a strategy that works.  Westwood even managed to take some of the cheese out of its movies.  Very good.",positive

4290,loved it,positive
4291,"First and Foremost I have to say that the PC version Graphics and facial Animation Details in this game are stunnig and awesome....I was deeply impressed it made me feel like i was watching a interactive movie.

Secondaly, For those who aren't to thrilled with EA titles, know this, BIOWARE was the sole Developer on this project, EA is merely the Publisher. BIOWARE is the developer of Mass Effect,  Star Wars Kotor1, Neverwinter Nights 1, Jade Empire, Baldurs Gate series. These games were all game of the year winners. So hopefully this will encourage you to try this game out.

Ok so...the game itself. If you are not a gamer who likes to immerse yourself in a very deep dynamic game system this game Is NOT for you...the are alot of abilites, functions, and aspects to this game...so if you are a Call of Duty or Halo guy/gal....you'll prolly just get confused with this game. However, if you Liked Mass Effect, Jade Empire and Neverwinter Nights then this game is a perfect addition to the Bioware collection.

Video/graphics: simply put for PC they are amazing, especially the facial expressions the NPCs make are stunning and refreashingly authentic. the Gore/violence effects are pretty cool..if you don't like all the blood you can just reduce the effect in the options menu. And finally errors, i have had zero graphics issues or errors while playing this game, no jumpy frame rates or lag issues of any kind...i have to say the graphics engine was very well done by the development team. I am using a Nvidia 8800 GTX card with all video settings maxed so i do have a advantage using a higer end card but there are better ones out there. I highly recommend if you get the PC version you have a system that can handle the high needs of this game or you won't get to experience the game to its full capability, you prolly should just get the Xbox version instead.

Gameplay: ok so be aware this is a True RPG like Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter Nights 1, so if you are use to Mass Effect/Jade Empire third person shooter/action style this is not the same. while all actions take place in real time the action squences are very strategic in nature, especially in high diffifulties. for example...Similar to Final Fantasy 12, Dragon Age has a system called tactics, which are preset settings you can unlock to make command and control for your party easier. like you can have your mage and ranged characters preset to auto attack any other ranged or mages, and your tank auto set to tank any high damage dealing classes. At low difficulty levels you can just make these changes on the fly with minimal resistance but when playing the challenging hard or Nightmare difficulties you will not succeed without using the tactic system or using the pause before combat option(so you can prepare your strat). Oh yes, the pause before combat option, in the settings menu you can set the game to auto pause when you are engaged in combat, this is highly recommended to players who use the harder difficulties so you can issue your orders to your party members before any damgage is dealt. Another cool aspect is the combo system...once you get certain abilties you can chain several melee or magic abilties together to create a combo that will unleash massive damage or specail effects. Also, be aware Almost all true RPGs have Friendly fire settings for hard difficulties which obviously means, that the big fireball you just shot into the middle of your friends and bad guys killed the bad guys, but prolly just killed your friends too, and the only way to turn off friendly fire is to play EZ mode and makes the game far more challenging, so again strategy is very important. Lastly this game features a ""Influence/Moral"" system, where the choices you make in the game affects the demeanor of your party members toward you. if you manage to gain high influence with certain characters a romance plot maybe accessible or if too low they may eventually abandon you altogether. Also the choices you make and the influence you have with your party will affect the final part of the game so be careful you could find your self betrayed at the end if you show bad judgement with your party members and the choices you make.

Story: this game consists of Six Origin Stories, each origin story is unigue to your race and class so to truly somplete the game you are highly encouraged to paly through all the classes and races. Some people find this time consuming, but me I Find it fun and highly detailed story. Also Each Origin Story changes the overall ending of the game...just fyi. Since at the time of the review the game has only been out for a day...I have only had time to play the Human Noble Warrior aspect of the game and am still not done, maybe half way through. which leaves me with 5 other Origin Stories to explore later.

So here are the ratings for each Aspect of the game 5 out of 5 ratings.

4294,"This was an awesome game, but an even better then the other two games before it.  Kratos is nearing his end fight with the Gods of Olympus.  I must say I enjoyed myself and I was quite pleased with the results of this game.  I was trembling with excitement with each passing moment of each God fight, and the finale against Zeus was exciting fight indeed.  This game was a delightful challenge and story was awesome too.

Pros
1.  There was lots of boss fights, and all of the boss fights were challenging to say the least.
2.  I found the puzzles to have the right amount of trickery to make this game exciting, so that was a definite plus.
3.  This game had a puzzle game with Aprohodites if your interested to see what I am talking about ;D.

Cons
1.  I really don't have much against this game it was definitely my favorite in the series, but I was upset I didn't get to see Artemis in this game.  Maybe she was in another game other then the main 3 games of God of War.

Overall, this was a great game and I enjoyed it a lot.  I highly recommend this game to all PS3 users.  10/10.",positive

This game is corrupted,I get rainbow color flashes while I play the game,no matter what level the game is in,I contacted the seller regarding an exchange replacement,and to date I have not heard anything from this seller.

My advice is to not buy PC games from this seller.

Update,this seller sent me a replacement COD 2 for the one I purchased that is extremely corrupted,this replacement is also corrupted,but instead of rainbow colored flashes in every step of the game,there are bright blue columns going up into the sky,the game suddenly stops,and bright blue streaks run across the game when it is being played.

4300,"The Destroy All Humans series is brilliant. With #2, you are now in the 1960s, with hippies and KBG agents all around you.

If you didn't play the original Destroy All Humans games, it involved grey, big-eyed aliens coming down to earth in the 1950s. You ran around reading their thoughts, taking over their minds, and slaying them. Half of the fun was the incredibly funny sense of humor in the game as you interacted with these humans of the 50s.

With Destroy All Humans 2, we jump forward to the 1960s. The President of the US (JFK) was apparently a female-loving space alien. The KBG realize this and try to help out. The next thing you know, the aliens are on attack again - and you're in charge. You run around city maps, watching as hippy chicks shout out ""Back off, Pig!"" and reading their minds. You can mentally throw objects, take over bodies, and much more.

This game is much more ""active"" than other adventure games - you have to hammer on buttons to get actions to occur. You can't just passively press one button and be all set.

The graphics are great. You really get immersed into the world of the 60s, with the appropriate cars, the hippy vans, the murals painted on walls. The outfits people wear are super. There are the traditional items to collect, objectives to achieve and people to slay. But again, most of the fun is in what you hear along the way. The commentary is hilarious. The thoughts you overhear can get you laughing out loud.

If humans happy to see you doing something ""alieny"", you can zap them with free love - and the daisies dancing in their brain, along with the hippy music, will soon distract them from any troublesome thoughts of grey aliens.

Even better, if you have a friend come and visit, you can do co-op play!

Now, there are a few anachronisms - didn't ""Love the One you're With"" come out in 1970? Or maybe they're saying Stephen Stills got his inspiration from a hippy dude named The Freak. In any case, I'm sure Destroy All Humans 3 will be set in the 70s, so we'll get enough of that soon enough. In the meantime, be sure to get your hands on this version, and help bring peace to the world!",positive

4309,"This is a great example of an expansion.  They did change nearly everything the fans asked for from Asylum for the better.

1) What more free roam, you can move across Arkham City from the very beginning of the game.

2) Less gadget dependent - you start with a lot more of the crucial gadgets and end up with a few more from story and optional missions.

3) Fighting remains great, but now with even more enemies and combinations.  Also Batman starts with a much greater arsenal as opposed to unlocking nearly all of it in the game.

4) The game is huge. To finish all the riddles, challenges, story, and all will sure take a much longer time than Asylum and keep you busy.

And much, much more.

The Catwoman gameplay is sufficiently different that it is not Batman with a different shape, she plays more like I remember Spiderman playing than Batman.  I haven't tried the downloadable characters, so no opinion on them.

I did feel the story was less realistic than the one from Asylum, it felt more cartoony and convoluted, but the ending while a bit detached from the story was absolutely great.  So in a way they make up for a weak story with a fantastic ending.  I can't avoid saying that I liked the villains from Asylum more than the ones from City, but not enough to take a star away from the game rating.

Great game, worth the money.  I hope these guys keep making games of this caliber.",negative

4319,"Dark Souls II is the sequel to Dark Souls, which is the spiritual successor to Demon's Souls. Both of the aforementioned games were masterpieces in my opinion, so I had high expectations for Dark Souls II. Unfortunately, those expectations were not met when Dark Souls II was first released. What exactly were my expectations? I wanted a game that is challenging but fair, a beautiful world that you can explore freely (more or less), and a story line that makes one yearn for more. The original release of Dark Souls II was certainly not a bad game, but it felt hollow (pun intended) compared to the original Dark Souls. There were a lot of issues that made the ""game feel ""cheap"" compared to the original. Fortunately, this updated version while still technically the same game is VASTLY improved!

SINGLE-PLAYER EXPERIENCE
############################
Let me say that Dark Souls II has an amazing player-versus-player options. There are lots of ""covenants"" you can join to invade other players, or help other players. The reason I prefer to play offline is because I enjoy being immersed in the world all to my own. I do not want to deal with real players (although again, I have nothing against those that love it). I like the story (Dark Souls has a deep story, even if it is told via minimalism) and find fighting other players a bit dull to be honest. This of course also means that in a ""tough"" fight you can not summon others to help you. Also, when you are traversing places such as the Black Gulch all by yourself, it really is beautifully unnerving!

NOTE: This is review is mostly spoiler free! I do talk a little bit about some of the differences between Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin and it's predecessor below. If you played the game for a few hours, chances are these will not be spoilers at all.

CHALLENGING
===========
If there is one thing Dark Souls [NB: when I just say Dark Souls I really mean all three games in the series] is known for, it's the challenge. This challenge, is what makes the game. Sure, the game is aurally and visually beautiful, but a major reason for this is the difficulty. For example, as you try to progress through the game, you come across a number of monsters that quickly attack and make short work of you. Eventually, you figure out how to deal with them, only to be sniped by an archer. Then, you try again and once you get past the archer you find there are even more enemies and they make short work of you! By your sixth try (or more) you finally defeat them, and then you realize just how beautiful are the ancient ruins around you! While Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin is very challenging, it is also fair. If an enemy looks like it can kill you in one or two hits, it can. Also, there really are no ""simple"" enemies. If you let your guard down and become shall we say a bit ""overconfident"", you may very well find yourself defeated by ""weak"" foes despite the fact that they are not nearly as difficult as more heavily armored enemies. The original release of Dark Souls II was unfortunately not what it should have been. In this updated version, there are different enemies placements, entirely new enemies, more invaders to fight (non-players), and of course the downloadable content opens up huge new areas (more on that below)! In short, THIS is the version I hoped to play when Dark Souls II was first released!

Downloadable Content
================
The new areas of the game are not only ""large"" areas to explore, they are arguably the most visually stunning areas of the game! They really are  beautiful. Also, they are extremely well designed and are not just ""go to area A, defeat boss, go to area B"" -there are secrets to find. As an example, in one of the new areas there are pillars that move up and down. So it really is three-dimensional exploring rather than just a linear progression for each area. I loved the Artorias of the Abyss expansion for the original Dark Souls. However, hands-down the downloadable content in Dark Souls II is far better. Although fighting Artorias was one of the most rewarding fights in ALL the Souls games, just in terms of exploration and enjoyment the three new areas in Dark Souls II are far larger in scope and the exploration is a joy. Also, they are all very diverse, and quite easy to access. And of course, the areas present new challenges to the player!

Scholar of the First Sin Upgrades
========================
The main draw here is of course the downloadable content as described above. However, there have been so many tweaks from the original release, that this feels like a new game! First off, the PS4 version has had a graphics upgrade. The original PS3 release did NOT look as good as the original Dark Souls! In general, sequels look better even if they are not overall better games, but in this case the original Dark Souls II release looked washed-out. Fortunately, that has been corrected with the PS4 version. Secondly, there are more enemies, enemies in different locations, MORE summons (which are extremely helpful especially when fighting certain bosses that otherwise feel cheap), and more non-player invasions (red phantoms)! In terms of summons, if you really want to beat every single boss solo, you can do that. However, I feel that the added summons (and invasions) are very well done and make what are arguably frustrating boss fights far better (although still not easy). There are of course new weapons to find, new armor, more dialogue from non-playing characters (NPCs), and it really feels like this is finally the complete version!

PRO
========
++Beautiful game both aurally and visually. The atmosphere is so vivid, at times it may just be tangible!
++Very difficult, but fair game. This is the most challenging of the three games in the series thus far.
++The DLC is amazing! It is all on disc, nothing to download! You will love it.
++Load Times: there are load times? You will hardly notice.
++Expect to spend lots of time on this game! This will be a long, beautiful, and challenging game!
++ADDICTIVE: this game should have a warning label.

CON
========
--NO manual! I know many games are doing it, but it would be nice to have a printed manual. Still, this is just a minor detraction.
--MUSIC: Dark Souls II ""Majula"" theme is gorgeous! However, compared to the original Dark Souls, or even Demon's Souls, most of the music is forgettable. Now while the game sounds great with all the sound effects and it has good music including a few wonderful pieces, overall it's not in the same league as the first two games.
--So Many Humanoids: The original Dark Souls has very different enemies with unique looks and attacks. Dark Souls II certainly has some amazing boss fights and some freaky enemies. However, in large part you will be fighting human-like undeads, human-like (but larger) sentinels, human-like but huge bosses, etc. More diversity would have been nice. However, this does not ""ruin"" the game by any stretch of the imagination.
--Torches: I love the sense of being alone in a dark, dreary, dangerous place with only a sword in one hand and a torch in the other! Unfortunately, most of the game is much ""brighter"" than I would like, and in fact, many places already have lit torches for whatever reason. This is just a minor point, but I feel much more could have been done with torches.
--Farming Issues: Overall I'm not a big fan of having to ""farm"" enemies for items. However, I found myself wanting to upgrade my equipment but I had no titanate chunks. On the other hand I had SIX titanate slabs! Titanate slabs are supposed to be super-ubber rare (they are used to upgrade gear from +9 to +10), and yet I had SIX of them and NO titanate chunks. This is a bit broken.
--ADDICTIVE! I realize I also have this under ""pro"", and the truth is it is a double-edged sword! It is SO addictive, you may let things slide that you should not!

BOTTOM LINES: A perfect game? Certainly not. As good as the first Dark Souls? Again, I have to say no. However, THIS upgraded ""Scholar of the First Edition"" is *close* to the greatness of the first Dark Souls game and it is a VAST improvement over the original Dark Souls II release. Also, this can now be found for $30 or less! At this price, I can easily recommend it to everyone. Here's wishing everyone happy gaming and let us hope that Dark Souls 3 will be a masterpiece!

My Score for the original release of Dark Souls II: 80/100
Final Score for Scholar of the First Sin: 90/100  (as you can tell, the upgraded version is VASTLY better)",positive
4320,"My son uses this to play MS flight sim X. At 10 years, he was able to set it up and configure it all on his own. The one time I used it I was very impressed by how solid it felt. All the movement felt intentional, nothing shaky our out of place.",positive
4321,"Everyone seems to be comparing the Dreamcast with the PS2 and making some legitimate gripes.  However, I ask this of people... if the PS2 came out before the Dreamcast, would you be making the same gripes?  If the PS2 came out over a year ago, I'm sure they would have the full capabilities that Sega presents and then some.  Also, many complain about no internet connection, etc...  The PS2 is capable.  What Sony has not done is sell the components to make it a realization.  It's all a marketing ploy so they can build up hype and sales.  Give the PS2 a year, and it will surpass the Dreamcast in gameplay, selection, and capability.
I personally found the PS2 attractive because of its backward compatibility and the ability to play DVD's.  I will say that the games are quite good for being such a young system.  Also, the DVD playing is sufficient.  Although the controls are awkward because you have to use the analog controllers, it still suffices as a DVD player.  There is a third party remote, but I don't trust third part equipment.  I'll wait for something better.  As some have said, the vent is quite loud at times.  The hum will be annoying at first esp. if you place it on a hard surface, but it's something you'll get used to.
Should you get the PS2?  Yes.  Should you get it now?  No.  The price will definitely go down with time, and it'll be more affordable then.  Also, there will be more games later this year.  Also, for those who don't have a DVD player, this system will keep you entertained two-fold.  If you're going to compare it to the Dreamcast, ask yourself where the PS2 will be in equal time.  You can't compare a 5-year-old to a new born and automatically say that the 5-year-old will be smarter in the long run just because it can read and the newborn can't.",neutral

4323,"Finally broke down and purchased me a Playstation 3. Take a wild guess what game I bought first for the system? That's right, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, that's what game.  I won't lie to you, I was expecting ALOT of the first PS3 iteration of R&C.

So, what do I think of Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction? Well- if you look at how much fun I thought the game was & how I rate the game overall, you'd have a pretty good idea. First and foremost, I was impressed by virtually everything about the game. Even though it's alot more of the familiar territory that the Playstation 2 games were, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction
does it on a much grander scale. It, definitely, has a much more epic feel to it. In what other game could you grindrail with a building coming down around you, anyways? Another thing, the newer gameplay mechanics introduced into the game felt natural yet innovative at the same time(like, for example, tilting your Sixxaxis Controller to control Ratchet through a bunch of flying cars after he jumps from a building). Graphically, this game is simply amazing. It's vibrant and colorful and is like you're playing a Pixar movie. Sound is top-notch. Gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect for a R&C game but it's riveting and, above all, fun.

The only fault I found with the game is, if you're a seasoned R&C vet, you're going to blow through the game rather quickly...and that's even with rounding up every last thing in the game and doing everything you need to do. I clocked in, roughly, 10 to 12 hours on the game. The difficulty is pretty easy for one who's played the series before.

Otherwise, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is a game that every PS3 owner should add to their collection,...especially if they love Platformers. You can't get much better than this.",positive
4324,"I wasn't sure I would like Morrowind at first. I have to say Im not a huge fan of RPGs. The final fantasy series and other ""traditional"" RPG games really turned me off of the genre. Morrowind however, showcases everything positive about the concepts of RPG gameplay in a game that I was truly impressed with.
First Graphics. Morrowind is played from a first person perspecitve, but a 3rd person view is also available at any time with a simple click of the right thumb stick. The glorious 3d engine does an amazing job of rendering a gorgeous environment. The water effects in particular are breath-taking. Weather effects too are just incredible. The visual aspect of the game blows any other RPG game out of the water.
Sound too is well done. The effects of thunder really shakes the room, and the opening theme music really sounds epic and gets you in the mood for adventure. Voice work isn't bad either, but some sound effects could have used some extra detail and variety - more musical variety for example, and battle sound effects are somewhat generic.
Gameplay however is paramount in this game. Morrowind is a HUGE and expansive game, you play a character which you create yourself in a province called morrowind of the ""great empire"". When you begin you can choose between a whole bunch of races, and classes, as well as choosing your look, sex, name and birthsign. This allows for limitless variety in gameplay experience and replayabillity. Playing the game as a Nord Warrior born under the warrior sign will be VERY different from playing as an orcish mage.
The character custimization is just one example of how detailed and complex this game can be. Character stats cover everything from basic attributes such as your strength and agillity ratings, to skills such as marksmanship or blocking. You improve your stats by playing the game and actually DOING things. Using a skill will eventually cause your proficiency in it to increase. So if you want to get good at picking locks, go out there and pick locks! This is SO logical and works well in the game.
Beyond the concept of practice makes perfect, I must emphasize that this game is completely open ended and free roaming. You play the game the way YOU want to play it. You can be good or bad, have people like you or hate you. Join one guild or a bunch. Be a theif and sneak around pick-pocketing people or a warrior taking what you want by force. You go where you want to go whenever you want to go, and do whatever you want to do. The game never tries to restrict your actions, and will even let you make bad choices. The plot is deep and involved, but there are many side plots and side quests all richly detailed and fun. This game takes a serious investment of time as well, and be prepared for several novels worth of text to read. Books found throughout the game add to the background story, you can get as deep into the game world as you want.
Above all, I don't think I've ever played a game as detailed, and open-ended as this one. Literally hundreds of hours of gameplay are possible, and a huge world to explore. You're given an entire island (plus 2 other areas in the exapnsions) to explore... and you're completel free to walk from one end to the other... although it would take you a long time!
The only downside to the game is that it's so big and so open-ended that some people may be overwhelmed or not know ""what to do next"" as the game is non-linear in nature. The game also takes a lot of time, and you need to ""get into it"" in order to really enjoy it. If you love games that give you freedom of action or that have rich detailed plots or huge worlds to explore, then check out morrowind, you'll thank me later. If you aren't the kind of gamer that apreciates attention to detail or story elements, then try it before you buy it.",positive

4327,"Im not a hard core gamer, but I do play brain games a few minutes most days, attempting to stem the ravages of age.  Ive been somewhat frustrated by my little wireless mouse when I see what the next few moves should be but my mouse is still thinking it over.  As a result, I was happy to be able to try a mouse engineered for quicker responsiveness in game play.  Heres my take on the Logitech G302 Daedalus Prime MOBA Gaming Mouse:

PROS:

1) Faster responses  Not only does this mouse respond quickly to my movements, the games actually play better when Im using it.  Games that would sometimes freeze, now run perfectly.

2) No Cord Interference - I had a certain amount of concern that the cord would interfere with my play, a condition I experienced frequently with the old-fashioned corded mice.  Not so with this mouse.  Play is smooth with no unwanted pull from the cord.

3) Automatic Default Settings  Although this mouse can recognize a number of games and will set itself appropriately for them, its default settings are all I need to get moving quicly and play like I want to.  Im impressed with its speed and accuracy even in default mode.

Cons:

For my small hands, this mouse is larger than I prefer; however, its responsiveness makes up for it overly large size.  It beats my small wireless mouse in every aspect except size.

Overall, this is a better mouse than Ive ever used.  I recommend it for faster, more accurate game play.

4330,"My daughters have had the chance to play with Lego Friends sets in the past and I have to say that as a parent, they encourage such creativity that I love them as much as they do. Thus, when I received this game I was hoping that it truly engaged them and drew them into the Lego Friends world even further, and the game did not disappoint.

Even my five year old enjoyed this game so it really is a game for numerous age brackets, which makes the game even more valuable for my family.

My girls' favorite part of the game was exploring Heartlake City. While they mentioned liking the whole game I kept finding them wanting to go back and explore and interact with the world that Lego first created in the ""real"" world.

In the game itself, the graphics were well done, and I liked that there were quite a few mini games within the game itself. By doing small things for others you got to play further, which was definitely more fun in the end!

This game has so many great aspects to it and it will provide your family with hours and hours of fun!

That's summer for you.  The core base might be a little miffed at how they toned down the rpg elements from the first game, but if you take it as it is, there's almost nothing it does wrong.

4332,"This is an awesome little adventure game. It's completely open world, which means you can explore and goof around as much as you want.

It might look like a kid's game, but it's actually really fun for all ages. Explore, interact with what you discover, and then follow the story as much as you want. (I got into the story after a while, making the game an obsessive thing I wanted to finish!)  After figuring out how the game works, which is pretty easy, you end up finding out that the story is about finding the Star Plant and to save your dude's (B.U.D.) planet.

4334,"A highly detailed medieval strategy game, ""Crusader Kings 2"" allows players to take the role of a noble in the medieval world and climb the ladder of success by any means necessary.

""Crusader Kings 2"" is a game by Paradox Interactive that puts players in the shoes of a European noble during the medieval era. The player can start as anyone from a lowly baron to a king or emperor, but the goal is the same: get as much prestige and money as you can, no matter how you do it. As a ruler, you'll have vassals, courtiers, and advisors who can help you accomplish this, though staying in the good graces of your superiors, your inferiors, AND your neighbors is still no easy task.

Crusader Kings 2 prides itself on its complexity and detail, most notably the in-depth system of feudalism present in the game. This is the core essence of the game's concept: arranged marriages, childbirth, and succession are incredibly important, giving you social links, alliances, potential inheritance, and cause-for-war in the name of claiming one's ""rightful land"". However, the player must also be mindful of the ambitions of others, not only from other lands but from your own court and family. Characters will scheme, plot, form alliances, and make assassination attempts if it suits them.

Paradox Games is known for making incredibly complex, but also incredibly hard to learn, games. However, CK2 is probably the most accessible game they've made thus far. While it's still certainly complex, CK2 has simplified your means of interacting with the world to make it all a bit more understandable. As a noble, you have a council of five characters, who control your diplomacy, your military, your economy, your religous standing, and your espionage. These five characters can be assigned to different tasks, both domestic and foreign, and serve as your primary means of interacting with the world. Your other main form of interaction comes from diplomacy - arranging marriages, giving gifts, bestowing titles, and other things necessary to keep people happy. Other parts of the game, such as the military and the economy, have basically been made automatic; you can make decisions about them, but for the most part they take care of themselves.

What gives Crusader Kings 2 a lot of its detail and vigor is its character system. Characters possess traits, gained through game events or random events, that define who they are and how they act. Whether they're proud or humble, shy or outgoing, warlike or peaceful, lustful or chaste, all affects how they act as characters and gives the player more of an understanding of what's going on in the game's narrative. While the game tends to throw a lot of characters at you (courtiers, mayors, bishops, etc.), it's still neat to see the development of one of your children, or tutor a courtier's son so that he can grow up to be your marshal, or something along those lines. Of course, you'll have to make hard decisions, too - if a rival family is in a position to usurp your dynasty, you may just have to take them out. These events, and the realism latent in them, help to define CK2 as something more than just a game system.

The only bad parts of CK2 is that, despite the great advancements in gameplay design, the game is still kind of complex to look at. There's so many baronies, duchies, kingdoms, and empires on the game map that it becomes hard to tell who's who, despite the ability to switch between different filters on the map. Similarly, there's so many characters in your court that it can become hard to pick out who's who and manage them all. This is sort of an inevitable problem with the level of detail that CK2 has, though, so it's not necessarily their fault.

Overall, CK2 is a great experience if you're willing to put in the time and the effort. It's not totally hard-to-learn like many other Paradox games, and it offers a lot of detail and gameplay. Definitely worth picking up if you're interested in the period or interested in strategy.

4335,"My first Game Boy handheld system was the red Game Boy Color system and since then, I've played so many games for Game Boy. I traded in my original purple Game Boy Advance to get the Game Boy Advance SP system in platinum and it's awesome! It folds like a mini laptop, has a slightly bigger screen, improved back light so you can play in dark places and is backward compatible with all Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.

The PROS: It's made from Nintendo so the quality is way up there. It's sturdy, can take a beating and with its new design and choice of colors it comes in, it's the definitive Game Boy Advance version to own that will last for years to come.

The CONS: There is one small drawback that caused a bit of ire among GBA gamers. The GBA SP is so compact in design, Nintendo had to leave out one small detail: the headphone jack. Up until this release, every version of Game Boy had a headphone jack to plug in headphones while you play your games. In order to plug in your headphones to the GBA SP, you had a buy a headphone jack accessory and snap it into the back of the system. While it wasn't too expensive, it still caused some gamers to complain about this issue. Thankfully, Nintendo didn't repeat the same mistake with future portable systems.

The Game Boy Advance SP is Nintendo's second revision to its popular handheld system. Though they did release one more revision with the Game Boy Advance Micro, the GBA SP is still the favorite among the three different versions and would prove to be more valuable in time: with the release of the Nintendo DS (and future revisions), it is backward compatible with Game Boy Advance games only. If you haven't owned any Game Boy or played any Game Boy games, get yourself a GBA SP. You won't regret it. *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****",positive

4338,"Great game! I was a big fan of the first game and pre-ordered the sequel as soon as it was announced. It was worth the wait! I've now played through it twice. First time through it was a horror game. I took it slow, inching forward a room at a time and jumping at all the scares. Second time through it was an action game. I did it running and gunning, blasting away with up-graded weapons and trying to get all the achievements. I'm sure I'll run through it again.

Multiplayer isn't my thing. I played a few rounds before going back to campaign. The thing I like about Dead Space is the solitude, the atmosphere and the scares--none of that is in the multiplayer. Early on in Visceral's video campaign, they talked about it being ""Left 4 Dead Space."" That's not the case, the levels are small, steal-the-flag type levels. I don't think I'll bother with multiplayer again. But the single player is so good, you can forgive (and forget) the multiplayer stuff.

Everything else about this, though, is pure gold. The build quality is phenomenal for such a small device, the analog sticks work amazingly well for being so small, and the portability just can't be beat.

- The graphics are great.  Cut scenes are really nice. The movement of the enemies is the most random/realistic I've seen in these kind of games.
- It's fun.  Shooting up everything that moves is just a thrill.
- There are some unique bits like your buddy can hold a car door and crouch and you can automatically follow behind him and shoot.  It's different and fun.
- Some of it is awkward.  I still don't understand the need for a two-person silmutaneous sniper shot.  I don't understand why that is needed.  But well, a minor point.

Frozen is a good movie and the chater is elsa and anna and spen and olef and kirstfall. The wrst part was when Anna was frozen by Elsa on asdit. The wudful part was when Elsa was sing let it go. The other wonderful part was at the end.  and the end of the move was that anna got unfrozen by Elsa from love.

I think in my opinion I think that frozen is a good move for kids because they toke about love a they are nice people in the move. like elsa and kristfall and oled and spen and ann. I belive that Elasa us a wonderful charther.

Frozen is a good move and one reason is people shoud go see frozen if they haven't saw frozen. Also frozen has good chater in the move and frozen sin good songs. Another reaon is frozen is a wonderful move for kids because thhey have good songs and good chachter in the movie.. It is good movie and I shjas you go see frozen.

It is helpful to eat popcorn when you are waching frozen. It is helpful to lay down when you are watching frozen. It is helpful to be cite becausse it is a helpful move because it teach you to love your spling.

They integrated the stylus perfectly, they really did, I love how you'd have to use it to break locks search dumpsters, and the PDA system is brilliant, it's smooth and painless. As many other reviewers have stated, the drug dealing system is almost a game all of it's own, but the main storyline is where it's at, there is all the humor you'd expect from a GTA game, the characters you interact with are sleezy and cheap, backstabbing jerks, and I love it. I definitely got my moneys worth out of this game, between exploring the 3 islands, sidequests and main story, I finished the game in just 20+ hours.

Open environment with task selection gives similar feel as Fallout series.

(Small spoiler) When you get to the vault task, to kill the destroyer I got this to work. Equip the Eridian canon and do not move when you materialize. Shoot the hopefully still sleeping destroyer in mouth about 40 times. If you move you will die. You will probably have to do this several times to get it right. I spent a huge amount of ammo and rematerialization costs trying to kill this thing with almost no impact on it. Level 34 or better is a good idea.

Even though she's sleeping, I would rather play my PS4 in the same room as her vs. going into another room at night.  This screen was just what I was looking for!

Verdict: I couldn't be more pleased with this!

Extra Details: This screen is much larger than I anticipated.  This may be portable, but don't be fooled, it's a pretty good sized screen.  The stand and cover it comes with is such a nice touch.  Don't let the reviews saying that it doesn't have much of a viewing angle keep you from buying this.  If you are the only one using this screen, who cares!?  Find the sweet spot on the screen and you're good to go!

Cons: The power button doesn't always turn on my screen for some reason.  Sometimes I have to hit it 3-4 times before it will turn the screen on.  Weird?  Not sure if it's just my screen or not. It's not a deal breaker.  Once the screen does turn on, I forget it took me a few tries for it to work.

Do I recommend this for you to buy: If you are looking for a way to play your PS4 without disturbing someone next to you, this is the best solution I have found.  I connect my headphones to my dualshock 4 and never have an issue.  I highly recommend this!",positive

4358,"I own every single Spider-Man game to date. I'm a Spider-Man nut and the moment any of these games hit the market they hit my system for some swing time. This is one of the better Spider-Man games on the market and certainly the best Beenox made Spider-Man game. There have been some big changes this time around. For example you actually have to think about which hand to use while web slinging since you can shoot webbing with your right and left hand using the right and left triggers. And attempting to shoot a webline from the wrong hand can make you fall. It also helps while turning corners to shoot with the corresponding hand. The web rush is back from the previous game which is a plus. Although I have noticed it doesn't work as well as it did in the first game. I put the first game back in my system to make sure and as it turns out the web rush system worked much better in the first Amazing Spider-Man game. Every time you'd push the web rush button in the first game it worked. It seems like half the time you push the web rush button in this new game it doesn't work. I'm glad the web rush is back, I just wish they took the time to make it work as well as it did in the first game. So what about the improvements?

Unlimited crime! Better swing mechanics! Smoother combat! A better story line! More classic villains! More than a dozen different costumes that actually effect gameplay! Stealth gameplay has been vastly improved! A nice variety in side missions! And Peter Parker missions this time! Oh, and let's not forget the fact Stan Lee makes more than just a quick cameo in this game. He plays a big role this time around and it's great! I won't spoil it for you but let me just say it is all very clever and adds lots of replay to this game.

I am thoroughly enjoying this game. I have run into a few minor bugs but nothing game breaking (which will probably get patched anyway). The ability to choose dialogue ala ""Mass Effect"" was a nice touch as well. If you are a Spider-Man fan there is no way you will not enjoy this game.

*update

I'm much further into this game and I have to say the story line is great! What they do with Kraven and Spider-Man is just fantastic. The debate they get into over whether or not they should ever take a life, and if it is ever justified is just flawless. I was not expecting this caliber of writing for a video game movie tie in. I also really enjoyed what they did with a certain serial killer in the Spider-Man universe. Normally I don't care for changes to story lines and characters from the comics but what they do with this character was very inspired. I don't want to ruin who and what they did, but let me just say the writing for this game is top notch. Best Spider-Man game story since the Ultimate Spider-Man game which was written by the great Brian M. Bendis. So that's saying a lot. You know Beenox has done this game right when, more than once, I actually thought to myself the story line in this game improved upon the story line from the movie. That's all, I just wanted to give an update.

*update 2

I've finished the game and put a lot of hours into the game after having complete it. I love swinging around New York (and replaying missions) but what is starting to drive me crazy is before every random crime it has to load. Which is weird because you can see the guys you are about to fight in real time before it loads. But any way it loads to show you a small cut scene when you arrive and then cuts to another small cut scene when you win and then has to reload the city. When in ALL other free roam Spider-Man game there is no loading to fight the random crimes and loading when you finish the random crimes. It's time consuming and annoying. It also pulls you out of the game. But worst of all is the Daily Bugle news spots they play OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER...

and over after each crime resolved. There really should be a way to turn those off. Or at least skip them the moment they start. Instead you have to watch at least half or sometimes more of each of them before the game lets you skip it. And for someone like me who plays this game non-stop for hours and hours it can get pretty annoying to have to watch those Daily Bugle news reports 1000 times.

So over all this is a great Spider-Man game (possibly the best Spider-Man game yet right along side ""Web of Shadows"") and unlike the Amazing Spider-Man game before it, this one lends itself to being played non-stop like most of the other free roam Spider-Man games because of the unlimited crime. I just wish they didn't have to load every time I wanted to do a random crime. And every time after you complete a random crime.

*update 3

Ok, last update. I've put a ton of hours into this game even after finishing it. There is lots to do after beating the game. And the swing mechanics are actually much more dynamic than how they first appear. I find myself looking for the tallest buildings to shot a web onto so I can swing around it giving me 360 degrees of movement from that one web line or holding the ""B"" button to twirl around a corner while wall running instead of jumping off when you get to a corner. The web slinging only seems shallow to those who haven't mastered them. Beenox made them easy to use but complex to master. I can now do all kinds of neat tricks while web swinging around the city that I had no idea I could do when I first started this game. Possibly the best Spider-Man game so far.",positive

4366,"I put off purchasing this game for a few months before curiosity finally gave way. To put things in some perspective, I'm not a COD fan, or really a fan of any FPS games. They're just not that entertaining to me, personally. I've always been a fan of Nintendo published games, mostly just from a long history of putting out great content. Their games always have a sense of polish to them. I have a tendency (for the WiiU at least) to purchase any Nintendo published game that comes out, if not just for the lack of 3rd party support on the system.

After dismissing Splatoon as Nintendo's newest IP I'm glad that I finally picked it up. The game does a great job of navigating you through a very brief tutorial, which doesn't overwhelm you with options and combinations that you're going to struggle remembering 5 minutes later. After quickly passing through that there is a short introductory video that gives you the latest updates to levels and challenges, and then you're off to the races!

Being one that tends to prefer single player modes, I was initially uneasy about jumping immediately into an online multiplayer match. Little did I know that doing so, while at times overwhelming due the style of game play revolving around seemingly mass chaos, would be an endlessly enjoyable experience. The battles are quick enough to prevent you from getting tired, and exciting enough for you to just want to play one more. I found that the relatively simple controls made it easy for me to not finish dead last in points through my first few rounds, which eased the initial uneasiness of online play. Too many times I've jumped into an online game only to end up consistently last amongst a bunch of players that spend every waking moment playing (see: Halo). Needless to say I did not have any such experience with Splatoon.

In recap, this is a great game. Easy to pick up and learn, ability to play quick games (you can play a couple of rounds in 15 minutes) and its relatively balanced online mode gives this a huge thumbs up from me. Bravo, Nintendo. Now lets see you bring this to the 3DS :)",negative

4371,"So the world of gaming headsets has really expanded out of over the last few years, but these have really stood above the crowd.  If you are thinking about buying another headset, I would recommend saving your money up and getting this.  It is worth the money, every penny.

The reason I say this is becuase the sound quality is excellent, the headphones have a rechargeable battery in them (last about 9 hours and 12 hours with the mic on mute), and connecting the headset to the transmitter is super simple.  These things are super comfortable and block out A LOT of noise around you. What's cool is that these also have firmware on them, which Astro updates every time they find a solution/fix for any major complaints that they receive or major issues.  The company is very dedicated to their consumers.

The other great thing about these is the customer support of Astro.  Any company that has a live chat with someone whenever you have a problem is extremely useful. The live chat isn't just canned answers, but they are actual users of the products that take pride in being associated with the company.

Even if you are on the fence between the A50's and another headset, stop yourself from buying them and get the A50's.  You won't regret the decision.  I know, because I was in the same position 4 months ago.

**On a side note**
I've recommended these headphones to many friends that were using turtle beaches and tritons and, after much convincing from me, they went ahead and bought a pair to try them out.  Once my friends used the a50s, they put their old headsets in a box or took the old headset back to the store and haven't looked back since.  They are now dedicated astro people and swear by the a50s.",positive

4373,"I have to start by saying I love the game. The little details are the most important and EA Canada realizes that. If you are a fan of sports game I'm sure you played the new Madden and like me was extremely disappointed. EA Canada proved the Madden team has done nothing to improve the offline experience.

This is going to seem a little off but one of my favorite new features is the restricted free agents. They are such a big part of the real game that it only makes since they are in the video game. The tracking of actual draft placement is also impressive. I start my first dynasty as the Bruins and sure enough they have Toronto's first and second pick in 2011. Awesomeness.

The Be a Pro Mode is even more awesome this year then years past. Playing in the memorial cup was way more fun then I'd ever thought it be. Go Thunderbirds. The only thing that kind of sucks about it is that if you play really well you pretty much get guaranteed to get drafted by the oilers. Who wants to play for them really...

The new stick breaking feature is fun for a while until it happens to you when the game is on the line. The feature its self is nothing to write home about but like I said before its the little details that make or break these annual sport releases.

My one complaint is the new collision system. The hits do look completely awesome but why do I have to press in R3 of all buttons to make a hit. I think I just haven't gotten the hang of it or something but seriously it is a pain in the butt with everything else going. It just feels completely unnatural to press and hold in R3 while trying to deliver a hit. The process slows you player far too much and I actually miss about 80% of my intended hits. But like I said that's my only complaint.

Overall Great Effort by EA Canada keeping pace. Putting out a game once a year is hard enough on the next generation system and adding new features that Madden should have like RFA's proves they care a little more about their consumers then their counter part.",positive
4374,"This game is the best fps i've played, better than jedi knight: jedi outcast, half-life, and any other. Although I have put less time into this game then those games but this game is the most gripping game of them all. The mission design is some of the best of i've seen, from jumping out of airplane (the best action sequence in any game EVER you acually get to play it) to escaping from a exploding space station.  This game is pretty long, but it only took me 4 days to finish it (man I played 8 hours a day) on normal difficulty level. It is a shame that this game didn't sell well. Anybody who loves the fps genre should buy it now, and then buy the sequel.",positive

4379,"this expansion pack is going to comletely change WC3 for the better... WC3+expansion will definatly be one of the best RTS games for quite some time. I'm currently beta testing the game, so i should be able to give a rough idea of how it should turn out for the final release. Lot's of new features (i'm not going to get into details that are already avialable at the expansion pack website, for you can read there yourself)....
- my favorite new hero is the orc hero.... its like a powerfull voodoo witchdoctor..... most notable is his healing spell (which finally gives orcs a healing option for early game) which acts like chain lightning, but has a healing effect.
- spellcasters have been changed.... their attack type is now ""magic attack""..... their armor type is now ""unarmed"". I won't get into the details of how the attack and armor works, because they are likely to be modified for final release.
- spellcasters now have inventory! a 2 slot inventory.
- ancients now have heavy armor when uprooted (makes ancient rushing a little harder i guess)
- all races can now build item shops with items unique to each civ. Most notible is that each civ's item shop gets a unique orb... orcs get orb of lightning ;D.... orbs arnt available until tier3 though and cost about 400gold on current beta.
- cyclone is now dispelable
- crypt fiends (and other undead units) can learn the burrow ability which lets them dig into the ground and act as a spy/regen health
- you can now buy transport BOATS (at goblin shipyards)... this should make for some interesting water maps hopefully.
- orc burrows can be upgraded to heavy burrows which have fortified armor instead of medium.
- when units are following a hero, they mimic the heros actions.. i.e. if hero attacks, following units will also attack instead of just sitting there watching :p
- for people with slower computers, you can now adjust the spell detail level, which was a source of lag at times on older machines.
- minimap now has a creep mode. it highlights creep camps on the map via a grey circle; the bigger the circle the bigger the creeps.
BNET will be much improved too.... here are some features i've tried out on the current wc3x beta servers...
- built-in clan support! you can now create clans. there are now 2 friends lists basicly: the original friends list, and a new clan member list. The creator of the clan gets a cheiften icon, assistant's to the leader get shaman icons, normal members get grunt icons, and new members (initiates) get peon icons until they are officially accepted into the clan. There are also clan ladders and clan stats!
- Now you can stay in the chat room while searching for a game. After you choose game criteria (1v1, 2v2, maps, civ) and click search... the search screen minimizes to a small box in the topright and takes u back to the chat room. The small box tells you how long you have been waiting, and what the average wait time is for that game type.
Anyways, i can't wait for this to go final! it will make a great rts game even better!

My only gripe is that they come off a little to easily, and quite a few times after I pulled my PS3 controllers out of my bag when going to a friends house, I had to search for the triggers because they fell off. Also when the controller fell from the table to the floor I had to move my entire entertainment center to get the trigger back. If you plan on keeping these triggers on indefinitely, (I haven't found a game yet they don't help with) then this problem can be fixed with a small dab of Epoxy or Super Glue. Haven't had any problems after that. But be warned, this might damage your original triggers if they are forcibly removed. I paired these triggers with the FPS Freek stick extenders, and don't know how I ever played without them! I would recommend this product for any genre, not just FPS fans.",negative

A friend had been suggesting mechanical for years but I was always turned off because of the price. After doing a bunch of research I decided I'd give this one a shot and I'm glad I did. Everything appears well thought out and of high quality. The rubber stops on the feet are an extremely nice inclusion at the price point. At first I was concerned about missing the 10 key, but I honestly rarely use it as I mostly use my rig for gaming. I'm reviewing this shortly after I received it, but judging by other reviewers I don't foresee having issues. I will certainly update this review if I run into any!",positive

They beat up both a lot and still work after 4 plus months with no issues.

While I am still planning to replace my workhorse basic keyboard with a programmable RGB like the Corsair K70 RGB or something by G.Skill or Logitech; if you are looking for a great budget combo with lights. This ones feels great to type on and looks great too for the price. I really am shocked. If you are building a new system and want to space out spending money on the really nice gaming keyboards, or refreshing the experience on and old system with worn keyboard, this is a great option.

4405,"I went in with decent expectations, especially after watching the trailers. The game did not disappoint, though it seemed some parts could have been improved upon. The game emulates the book well enough, but takes a lot of cues from the television shows. It is strange not hearing David Suchet and Hugh Fraiser in their roles, but the voice actors do their best to bring out the characters,  especially the voice actor of Poirot.

The graphics are good, especially for the backgrounds. I got a tingle seeing  the. Whitehaven apartments in the opening. The characters look great in their animated forms and they definitely have an interesting style to them. I miss Poirot's duck walk, but understand it would have been very annoying throughout the game proper.

Gameplay is where the game shines. The puzzles aren't too difficult,  but challenging enough to be entertaining. I quite enjoyed the interviews and the potential for different interactions. My favorite part is getting points for acting like Poirot... I kept seeing Suchet and his actions in my head, then hearing his voice read the words on the screen, and imaging the reactions.... Definitely the best part for fans of the book and the show.

This is a simple enough game that is best experienced by those who love Poirot. It is fun, short, and meant to be played multiple times. I highly recommend a ""screw up"" playthrough... Makes Japp seem like a genius!",positive

4408,"*Update* Just beat the game and got a platinum so I cleaned this up a little.

Here is a quick list of what I found to be the good and bad of this game/set

Pros-
Value: 80 for a fun game, nice steel case, statue, DLC codes AND Zeus/Isaac Clark for Allstars!

Graphics: As good as 3, possibly larger scale. It's incredible to watch. They love cutting things open so you can see their insides. Tons of that in this game.

Variety: I love GOW combat but I'm open to changes - this game has some.  The 4 spells of this game aren't just cast, they effect how your weapons function and encourage you to play better. Grabbing is very different and the World Weapons give you more options in the heat of battle.
*After finally beating it I have to say that I love the combat and possibly more than 3. Though it's harder (cause of the enemies), it allows for a different level of strategy. Some fights where I was stuck I would finally try out new elements and be shocked at the difference and the power. The game seriously encourages you to break away from Kratos' typical multi-hit combo and try something new.  It also encourages you to be cheap and spam moves sometimes, but that's up to you - it'll only work for so long.

Multiplayer: Go figure, it's good. Some moments feel like Power Stone to me. Much less lag than on the Beta.

Cons-
Difficulty: It can be frustrating. This is probably the hardest in the series, especially in the earlier part of the game where they start throwing harder badguys at you but you don't have many upgrades. Most enemies fight like Satyrs in this one - as in they can attack through your combos. You'll find yourself abusing grab/throw moves while playing on hard.
*The game has a part that's so difficult that they're releasing a patch.  When I heard about the patch I had coincidentally just gotten to that part of the game and I was determined to beat it before the patch came out. The night prior I got frustrated and after 15+ tries I gave up and went to sleep, the next morning it only took me 2 tries.  Having a cool head goes a long way in this game. And I wasn't cheap, I didn't spam one or two moves, I was smart and I managed to beat that damn elevator. most unfair part about it are the lightning *bleeps*. And like most of the game, no enemy is a problem by them-self, but mixed into a crowd they can be devastating. Divide and conquer and the day is yours.
So, if difficulty scares you, know that a patch is going to be released for the most difficult part. But if it doesn't, there is plenty here to keep you going.

Statue Quality:  The base of this one is sort of cheap, Kratos isn't terribly detailed. Some reviews said he doens't fit on his stand right - he fit fine for me. It still looks great, but upon further inspection it isn't as great - compared to - other sony exclusive statues (Drake and Cole specifically)

Glitches: I don't remember any other game in the GOW series ever having a glitch that stood out to me! This one though... Ugh. Nothing game breaking by any means, but the audio can be weird at times, text put on the screen to help you (like an explanation of how to do a mini-game) doesn't disappear for like 5 minutes (until more text appears to help you), and then it has some annoying things with this one item you get that you primarily use for puzzle solving... Every time you press L2 to activate the item and then let go the screen flickers for a second around Kratos.  Then more than once I made a new path with that item but the path wasn't usable (it was still highlighted green like it was before I used the item), so I had to undo the path with the item and then re-do it so I could continue.

I won't mention story for either category. 3 is my favorite but I felt that one had too much story, which is silly, but because of the tone of the series it should have ended with Kratos standing above the world burning with ""You Win"" written in blood on the screen. Not the sentimental scenes they tried to pull. Ascension's story isn't bad, but I wouldn't write a book about it.

Also, the controversial scene... Ugh, I don't get people. I was playing normally, I passed that scene and when the trophy popped up ""Bros before foes"" I thought ""Wait, that was it?!"".  Compared to Every kill in GOW3 it was very tame. I suppose the trophy's old title could offend some people... I don't know. My girlfriend thought it was stupid and I don't personally understand it. How the trophy was described to me was on the scale of Hercules in GOW3, but it was more like a generic badguy, 3 punches and then a throw. I guess it's a half-pretty woman so people are offended. No one was upset with all the things you do to her unattractive sister.

That's it. Go buy it!",neutral

4410,"I wrote a rather detailed review about Wii Fit U under this product page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii-Fit-U-w-Fit-Meter-Wii-U/dp/B00FE8WKMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii Fit U w/Fit Meter - Wii U</a>. The bundle you see here is identical to that one, except that it includes a Wii Balance Board.

In case you're wondering, the Balance Board included in this bundle is identical to the one bundled with the original Wii Fit in 2007--unlike the Wii Remote Plus and the Wii U itself, there haven't been any upgrades to the Balance Board's technology since then. So if you already have a Balance Board, you'll be better off buying just the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii-Fit-U-w-Fit-Meter-Wii-U/dp/B00FE8WKMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii Fit U w/Fit Meter - Wii U</a>.

You might want to consider whether to get this bundle or to purchase a used Balance Board separately (they go for as low as $15 at places like Gamestop or Craig's List). Better yet, chances are you have a friend or relative who has one in the basement collecting dust who's willing to give it to you. (Here's a hint: there's a common problem where old Balance Boards appear to be ""dead"", but there's an easy fix for it. Just Google ""Broken Balance Board"" and you'll find the solution, which just required a screwdriver).

Now that that's out of the way, here's a summary of my thoughts on Wii Fit U:

As with the original Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, there are several categories of exercise activities:

- Yoga - A set of 18 Yoga poses, where you follow an on-screen trainer's instructions. It's greatly enhanced over the original Wii Fit in that you can view the trainer's body with a 360 degree view to ensure that you're matching it precisely. Furthermore, you have the option of viewing your own video image next to the trainer's using the GamePad camera (it doesn't automatically detect whether you're precisely matching the trainer, but you can eyeball whether you are easily enough). The Yoga poses are traditional ones like ""half moon"", ""downward facing dog"", etc. 15 of them are the same as in the original Wii Fit Plus, while 3 are new ones.

- Strength Training - A set of 15 activities to strengthen specific parts of your body, such as lunges, planks, extensions, and so on. Again, you follow a trainer to learn the correct technique, and as with Yoga you can view the trainer from any angle or view your own video image on screen. 12 are the same as in the original Wii Fit, 3 are new ones.

- Aerobics - These are cute games that use your Mii to do various activities to get your cardio going. 11 of the activities are the same as in the original Wii Fit, including Hula Hoop, Rhythm Boxing, and Island Cycling, although most of these activties have been enhanced with new features using the Wii Remote Plus, HD graphics, and ""second screen"" support on the GamePad. There are 4 new activities, including Puzzle Squash (sort of a first-person, 3D version of Breakout) and Rowing Crew (where you use both the Balance Board and the Wii Remote Plus to simulate rowing). The one gripe I have about aerobics activities is that they're far too short for you to get into a decent cardio heart rate zone, so you have to string together a lot of activities to get any kind of meaningful workout.

- Dance - This is a new category. I expected it to be something like Just Dance, but it's actually more like a step aerobics class with different kinds of music and focus on different parts of your body.

- Balance Games - These are cute games that use your Mii to work on balance and coordination. Returning are 11 old favorites like Rhythm Kung Fu and Bird's Eye Bullseye, which like the Aerobics games have been enhanced for the Wii U. There are 7 new balance games. My favorite by far is one called ""Dessert Course"", which ingeniously integrates the GamePad and the TV screen; you're a waiter who's trying to balance a bunch of rolling and jiggling desserts on a tray (your GamePad) while delivering it to guests in a crowded restaurant. Another one I love is ""Ultimate Obstacle Course"", which is an excellent upgrade to the original Obstacle Course (which is also included).

Another thing I like about Wii Fit U is the ability to play many activities on the GamePad, while freeing up the TV for others.

All of this would be an excellent upgrade alone, but the addition of the Wii Fit Meter adds a whole new dimension to the game. The Wii Fit Meter is a smooth, round device that's about 1 3/4"" in diameter that you clip onto your belt and wear throughout the day. Like a FitBit or a Nike FuelBand, it tracks your daily activity outside of the game, and is able to detect not just your steps (as a pedometer does), but also your level of exertion and your altitude. The unit also gives you time and temperature, and even displays a little LCD version of your Mii's face.

Each time you start up Wii Fit U, you'll be asked to sync the data (the unit stores up to 2 weeks of data). Once you've done that, you can see some cool graphs that help you visualize the amount of activity you've done by date and hour, as well as your level of exertion and your altitude changes.

There's a feature called ""Fit Meter Challenge"" where you can apply your Fit Meter data to complete ""challenges"" from around the world. You can choose walking challenges, such as a stroll through New York City or Tokyo. Each time you open the map, you'll be given the option of getting ""credit"" for the miles you've put onto your Fit Meter since the last time you synced the data. You'll see your little Mii progressing along the path, with buildings being filled in to the blank map, factoids and photos of the places you're ""visiting"", and coins ""blinging"" along the way. Similarly, you can choose altitude challenges; for example, climbing the equivalent of the Statue of Liberty, Mount Fuji, or Mount Everest. It's a nice added incentive to rack up as much activity as you can outside of the game itself.

While the Wii U has been maligned in the media and by the purchasing public (and sadly not unjustified in some cases), Wii Fit U is an excellent example of why I think the future is still bright for Nintendo. Whatever missteps they might have made in their console's hardware design and relationships with third party developers, their first party software development is still second to none. Every single activity and feature in Wii Fit U is polished and substantial ingenuity, is ""addictive"" enough to make you want to play more (an excellent trait in an exercise game) and is just a pleasure to start up and play. Many of these components alone (the Yoga classes, the Balance Games, the Fit Meter graphs and challenges) would make excellent standalone titles on their own, but they're all bundled together in one very affordable package here. And while there's been a lot of hype about new exergaming features on other systems like Xbox One, bottom line is that the Wii U is still the only video game console that lets you take (and track) your weight, track your offline activity, and play games that are as fun as they are exercise.",positive

4419,"I pre-ordered Madden 10 for the PSP, and really enjoy playing it. Madden 10 for the PSP's best feature IMO is the Superstar Challenge. Madden 10 for the PSP gives you a situation, for example New England is leading Miami by 10 with 2 minutes in the 4th quarter and you must make Ronnie Brown the Superstar to beat the Patriots. After you win that challenge, Madden 10 will give you the reverse situation of you being New England ahead by 10, while you must make Wes Welker the Superstar and having to maintain the lead. Usually, when I play Madden 10, I play the Superstar Challenge. MADDEN 10 FOR THE PSP DOESN'T DISAPPOINT!",positive

4421,"A fantastic follow-up to the best FPS in history. Halo 3, while it had a fantastic story, just isn't nearly as good as the Rainbow series in terms of gameplay. I'll start with the positives...

The weapons are fantastic. The way they shoot, the way they sound, and the way they look. They added a few new weapons, but I'd have liked to see a lot more. In addition, only being able to put one attachment on is a little silly. If you put high cap magazines on, for example, you can't have a scope. Unrealistic to the point of being silly.

They allow us to once again play cooperatively via split screen, online, or system link. THANK YOU! So few devs are letting co-op play get the attention it deserves, and they wonder why their games don't sell.

The new leveling system is wonderful. In the first game, the only way you could unlock the cool looking gear was to play versus online. And guess what? Not everyone likes to do that. This version allows you to get all the experience either online in versus mode, or playing the Co-op story or terrorist hunt.

Wonderful multiplayer options. You have your story, of course, and terrorist hunt, which gives the game unlimited replayability. The new online modes are cool too, if you're into that.

A few ""negatives"" for the game. First, the difficulty. Some of the silly reviewers found it so difficult that they gave it only one or two stars. Apparently they felt it was just that bad. The game is certainly more difficult than the first game, it sort of has to be. It had to be balanced to allow multiple human players. So although it may be a bit tough on single player, it is perfect when you have your buddies playing with you.

The player customization feature is nice, but unusually limited. In addition, the facial features like facial hair--all look the same. The pictures look different, but when its mapped onto the actual character, they don't really look any different at all. The goatee version--doesn't even have a goatee, lol. This is a mild complaint, because with camo and gear on your head, you never see the face much.

Not a lot of new weapons. Some people may not like the new ""kit"" system, but I think its pretty nicely done overall.

In a way it does feel like an expansion, as there aren't a lot of new features, but who cares? The first game was the best ever, and I'm perfectly happy having a bunch of new levels to play. They did add the sprint button, which is nice as well.

The BIG problem with this game was one that they claimed to have fixed after the first game. The spawning problem. For those of you who don't know, it is not uncommon at all for terrorists to appear, as if by magic, right in front of you--or behind you, in a room you had just cleared. Instead of populating the map with terrorists at the beginning, they sprinkle them in throughout--there is really no excuse for this. It is lazy game design and purely irresponsible.

And their idea of ""difficulty"" levels is just as bad as everyone else's. Instead of the logical thing, throwing more enemies at you, they just take away half of your ammo and reduce the number of respawns. Again, lazy design. I would have liked to change my rating from five stars to only 4, or even 3.5.",positive

4423,"A while ago a friend lent me his copy of Dragon Age Origins for the Xbox 360. While I enjoyed the game, I had a number of other games that I was playing, and I returned it without finishing it. With the price drops of the Ultimate Edition, I decided to finally pick up a copy, for the PS3, but it sat unused until a short time ago.

This collection comes with the original game as well as all the DLC. You'll still be prompted about a new DLC when you're on the start screen, but it's actually telling you about one that collected two of the DLC together, which I think is just an oversight on their end.

The DLC display as a second disc when you put the game in (there's only one physical disc) and require that you install each separately. I have an idea of why they did this, but it's unfortunate that you have to install each, as you can't just start the process, walk away to do something else, and then come back to have them all installed.

As for the game itself, I wanted this because of the RPG elements, and that I had played games of this type on PC many years ago. While initially people were worried that PC gameplay wouldn't cross over to the consoles, I don't think that was really necessary for this game.

However, there are times when I wish I had a mouse so I could better control which enemies my character attacks, but over the course of my many hours this only came up a handful of times, and in all but a few cases it didn't matter much.

The story for this game is actually quite good, with a nice variety depending upon your actions. There are different origins for each character type (with race, birth, and class all determining who you start as), and whether you care about the trophies/achievements or not, I'd recommend playing through them all, especially since you'll meet a number of the characters later, no matter your origin.

I ran into one glitch where a battle never ended, but at this point there's enough information about the game to know what to do to prevent it. I also found the initial loading screen to take a heck of a long time. I don't think this is related to the number of saves I had, and my network connection is fairly quick, but I didn't care enough to actually research it too deeply, so I can't complain.

This was my 10th platinum trophy, so I obviously enjoyed the base game enough to play the heck out of it (although the base trophies are more time consuming, depending upon what you do, than hard).

I honestly have a hard time finding any faults with the game. Is Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition really a five-star game? I could certainly see myself finishing the DLC that I didn't get through (including Awakening, which was once a game sold by itself), and have basically gone through all the main story options, so ... I supppose it is.",positive
4424,"Okay...I am going to admit that my review is biased because I am a huge Star Wars fan! I enjoy most Star Wars related products, espically video games. TFU is a really fun game. The force powers alone make the game for me. You can pick someone up and throw them across the room against other enemies. It's amazing! The gameplay isn't as bad as other game site reviews have stated. It definitely could be better, but it's not bad.

I really don't have much bad things to say about this game. A lot of people don't like the storyline, which I find to be a strength of this game. If you are a fan of Star Wars, then I would definitely recommend this game. If you are not a fan of Star Wars, I would still check this game out.",positive
4425,"Of the 4 Undead Skylanders, Hex is easily my favorite. She has a few minor problems but when we first used her a few months ago, I was floored by how effortlessly she could clear out an area. She might not be up there with Drobot, Stealth Elf, Cynder and Bash, but Hex can sure as heck hold her own in the main game. If you don't have an Undead Skylander yet, Hex would be a great choice.

Aside from being pretty, Hex has some great tools at her disposal. Her main attack is a skull fireball that she shoots, just like any other Skylander with a normal projectile. It goes a good distance and deals decent damage. If you choose the upgrade path for the fireball, they'll travel further, do more damage, and cause explosions when they hit enemies, dealing damage to anyone within the blast radius. Her next attack is Skull Rain, which takes a few seconds to activate, so you'll want to keep your distance from enemies when using it. When you hold down the attack button, Hex summons a few skulls that circle around her, then launch upward and then home in on enemies. If you go down the Bone Crafter upgrade path, more skulls will be summoned, and the charge time is cut down, making it much more useful. Finally, her third tool is a VERY cool Wall of Bones. With this, Hex puts up a couple of huge bones in front of her, acting as a shield. It'll take several hits for an enemy to break through, and while this is up, Hex is free to move around or attack from behind it. Use the Wall of Bones to make the most of Skull Rain. As you upgrade Wall of Bones, the bones will become larger and take even more damage before, and the final upgrade gives the bones spikes. This will deal damage to any enemy that touches them, so with it, Hex is going to be pretty safe and cozy as she summons skulls.

The downside to using Hex? She's on the slow side and her health is a bit low. But at the same time, with how defensive she can be when played right, the low health shouldn't be a big deal. In fact, when we played through the game, the only time Hex died was from traps in a few stages (mostly in the final stage). Otherwise, there's not much of a downside to Hex. She's great!

Cynder may be the most popular Undead type, but don't count out Hex. She's certainly better than Chop Chop and is a blast to use in Battle Mode.",negative

4429,"We already own the basic set when it first came out, but my kids love the Wii U so much they want another one so they can play the games while visiting the grandparents, too. So we bought this deluxe set, which seems to be the default official set at this time as of June 2014. The MRSP is actually $299.99, yes, that's the price for the Mario and Luigi deluxe set, which contains two games: Super Mario Bros U and Super Luigi U. We already had both games but since this is the default set anyway, it's totally acceptable. The deluxe set, compared to the basic set which may no longer be sold but I'm not sure... contains more accessories like stands, but more importantly gives the user discounts on all eShop downloads. We're not into digital downloads, here or on our PS4, because you can't take the games with you easily, but it may matter to people who download a lot. I do wish the deluxe set came in white like Basic Set because the black chassis looks ugly.",negative
4430,"Just Cause 2 is one of those rare modern games that still manage to capture the essence of what video games are supposed to be: pure fun.  The story's premise is essentially the same as the first game.  An island nation has made some poor choices and now we're going to send our best spook to destroy their infrastructure (and boy will you!) before forcing a ""regime change.""  Virtually everything (save for one thing) is done better and on a much grander scale than in the first game.  The map is massive and contains a slew of different environments.  The stronghold missions are still repetitive and boring but thankfully there's only a handful of them this time around, and I didn't mind doing them since they unlocked more side missions, which are usually enjoyable.  The one issue the developers still haven't perfected is the combat.  It's fun, and doesn't detract from the game, but you still get the feeling it could have been tightened up a bit.  Also, they must do a lot of skeet shooting on Panau because I lost track of how many times I've been shot flying through the air with my grappling hook or while I was in complete free-fall.

Still, the game is such a blast that these rare annoyances are hardly a complaint.  Just Cause 2 is still, in my opinion, one of the best sandbox games ever made.",positive

4435,"The Disgaea series is pretty much the only SRPG series that i like. I was never too fond of SRPG's and then i played Disgaea 1 which got me hooked. Still these games, as you should know, can consume 100's of hours of your life. The insane amount of levels you could get(not only your character but items as well!) was what hooked me but theres so much more to do and each addition to the series keeps adding even more!
I would say the 3rd one(this one) has the best gameplay. In terms of characters though i would rank it after Disgaea 1 but better than 2's. The story is alright(somewhat short though) with some neat twists, and the characters voice actors do a good job in my opinion. The graphics are the same as the first two, but Disgaea 4 NIS said will have better graphics. Though i hope its keeps the same charm it has always had. If the graphics discourage from getting this don't let it!! The grinding of levels gets annoying sometimes but i always come back after taking an 1-2 week break. If you like trophy's this game got a patch to include trophies it now has a whole ton of them to earn.
So to recap if you like SRPG's,funny wacky stories,funny characters(prinnys!), and a great bang for your buck you should give this a try!

4446,"I first have to say that the look and feel of this mouse is amazing.
What I was really more excited about though was all the macro-able keys.
 So far I have only found two things I dislike about this mouse. The first
is that the box says it has eight macro-able buttons, what they don't
tell you is that those eight buttons include the left and right mouse
buttons, the scroll wheel (Known as ""mouse 3"") and the DPI changing
buttons. While these can be macro-ed, the listing does seen to be a
bit misleading... The second is that when you go to macro your keys it
shows you a list of all the games it has pre-made macros such as
Battlefield: Bad Company 2, COD: Black Ops, etc, but when you try to
enter macros for games that it doesn't have listed there, they don't
always work. The one game that I thought this mouse would be amazing
for is Minecraft. I am running a server for it and there is a lot of
repetitive commands that I type quite frequently, sadly for some
reason every macro that I made wouldn't work. Which in all honesty,
not being able to use it for one game isn't the biggest deal, but if it
was a different game that you needed it for (like MW3 coming up!) it
would be a real let down. So other than those two complaints the mouse
is perfect!",negative
4447,"Hi, I've played pretty much every Spider-Man game that's been made from the Activision Spider-Man game for the PS1 through the Spider-Man Movie title games and now Spider-Man 3, and this one definatly tops the list thus far.

First off, for those of you who may worry if this game is the same as the console version or not, no worries, this game for the PC is identical to it's game console counterparts, with the exception of the Collectors Edition which includes an unlockable Goblin character.

Now about playability and performance on a PC.  I've also played this game on the Sony PS3, and on my computer, not only does it look just as good, it most definately runs better.  I have the game set on 1900x1200 reolution with all the detail options maxed out and the game runs flawlessly.  Also much to my surprise, I didn't even need to program my Logitech Rumble Pad 2 (PS2 Style Controller, as the game already had presets for it already made.  So not only does this game look and run better than on the console, it controls identically as well.

Now you may be asking, what kind of PC do I have that it runs so well, good question.  I'm running an AMD Athlon 64 4000+, FOXCONN Geforce 8800 GTS 640MB version (the 320 MB version should do fine for those of you running below 1900 resolutions), 3 Gigabytes of PC3200 DDR RAM, Soundblaster 2 ZS, and my HDD's are in RAID 0 (Yes, Raid is the way to go for improved Hard Disk Speed), and I have a 21"" CRT Monitor.

Okay, now that I've got some of the technical stuff out of the way, here's a little about the game.  I havn't completed the game yet but here are my impressions thus far.

Game Play:

The game play is awesome, New York City is rendered wonderfully, and is the best looking so far in the series.  This game is ""Sand Box"" Style, meaning it's completly free roam leaving you to do whatever missions or tasks you want to do, in any order.  The web swinging is amazing and not hard to get used to.  It really gives you the feeling of what it would be like to web swing around the city.

Controls / Fighting: The fighting, if you'd like to learn the combo's can be great, or you can just button mash your way through the game, if you don't wish to memorize the various combination of button pression for specific combos.  As Spider-Man you also have something called ""Spider-Reflexes"" which when activated, slows everything down and enables you to dodge enemy attacks and unleash more devastating combos.  There are also come parts of the game, to get through specific areas of the game or cut scenes, the button number of a specific button will flash on screen, and you will need to hit the buttons in sequence as they appear, or fail.  It may take a couple of trys sometime, but it's not hard.

Missions:  There's quite a lot to do in this sprawling city, and not only can you go around the city, you can also go under it, yes you heard me right, there's the full NYC Subway system, as well as sewer systems in the game, for more free roam and mission enjoyment.

Pulling up the map screen shows you where to go to see where the missions are, if you select a mission (to find it more easily) an arrow will appear when you exit out of the map, showing you how to get to that location and the distance to it.  The Map view also shows you where various challenges, and races are in the game, as well as what are good areas for crime fighting.

There are many mission types in the movie, some that are related to the story line of the movie, as well as original mission story line / content.  The missions can be fun, diverse and challening.  You also have puzzles like bomb disarming.

Final Thoughts and Conclusion (for now):

So here's the summary, if you have a decent computer / video card then don't hesitate to run out and buy this for the PC, don't dispair if you don't have the best computer, because you can change the resultion, and various detail settings to better suit the needs of many computer types / configurations.  1 GB of RAM is required and at least a 2.8GHZ P4 or equivelant.  The game runs beautifully on my system, and looks and controls better than the PS3 verion I tried.  The missions are fun and varied and gives you plenty to do in the game.  The fully rendered city, and web swinging / wall crawling is within it self so much fun it's worth getting this game.

On a side note:

For those who comment about PC Games needing patches, may be true of some games / programs but certainly not all games / programs.  Als also more and more console based games have been needing ""Pathes"" themselves lately.  I personally would much rather be running a PC game where I have more flexability to do what I want with it, and have more easily available upgrades, patches and upgrades to a program if and when they should become available.",positive

4452,"This is the best game in single player. It has realistic enemies, allies and it has great graphics and sounds that will blow you away. Remember me, the guy who wrote about the demo, now I have the full version. By playing the demo, you can only know a little bit about the game. The full version has 24 missions and each mission was so intense and good. It will get you hooked from the first time you get your hands on your computer. You can;t stop playing. When I played on easy, I beat the game in one day. Now, hard was different. Anyway, the graphics on the highest settings are great. You can see details on every building and just like what one of the reviewer said, you can see the shinying in the water. The sound is just as great. The background sound makes it feel more realistic than other WWII games but not realistic as in real life. It still comes close. You're allies are interacting with you as you play through out the missions and the nervousness when you are advancing by yourself after your teammates are all dead. In advertisements and stuff, it says that ""In War, No One Fights Alone"" ,but They do make you fight alone in the Damp, Ship and few other missions. But I like that feeling of nervous. When you are in it, you want to get out of it quickly but after you finsh it, you are eager to play that same type of mission again and you feel good for finishing the mission. In the mission that I wanted to play so bad since I saw the PCgamers preview, Stalingrad was the only mission that was a little dissapointing but special. Only reason why I was a little dissapointed was because I couldn't shoot because I never got a gun. At the same time that mission seemed most realistic and good. In the boat, you see sequences and it's great. Some guy jumps off the boat because he's scared and he gets shot for jumping off the boat. I also like the fact that the missions were based on the facts. I recently read one of these WWII books and it said that Russians fought with no arms (guns) in Stalingrad because they lost most of their arms in previous battles. Back to the game, this game was just super amazing. The system requirments are important because if you want to feel that realism, you need at least Pentium 3 1.6GH, 512mb ram, and at least Geforce 3 or radeon 8500 and above to play it on highest settings. Only con was multiplayer which could have been better but wasn't as good as Day of Defeat or Battlefield. In one sentence, this game has the best WWII single player missions ever and this game is the game that got the closest to the real life WWII action. This game is must be owned by WWII gamers and possibly, any and all gamers. (I also recommend Medal of Honor series)",positive

4456,"3DS Lego games suffered from a change in format since Lego Marvel Super Heroes but Lego Batman 3 has gone back to it's original format.

The levels are back to being fully explorable, you can flip back and forth between numerous characters on the bottom screen again and yes, THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU THE JUMP ABILITY BACK (I know this is a big deal for a lot of people)! Plays pretty much the same as the previous lego batman games. They have implemented the gold brick challenges and are now viewable before starting a mission eliminating the guess work. They're pretty simple like finding hidden items, collecting a certain amount of studs. At the start of the game you will play mostly as Batman and Robin but you will be playing as other superheroes at the game progresses.

Other features include full voice acting and real cutscenes that don't feel like they've been rushed. If you've played the Lego Batman 2 then you know Batman and Robin (and other characters) have multiple abilities that need to be swapped through and they can quickly be equipped and unequipped without changing the character itself. So for example, Robin's hazard suit can be taken on and off instead of having two separate Robin characters. The game at times does make use of the stylus/touchscreen as well for puzzles.

Long story short if you (or your kid) loved Lego Batman 1 and 2 on the handheld then this one is an instant buy.

EDIT: One more thing to point out. If you lose all of your hearts you DO NOT have to start the level over. It returns to the lego batman 2 format of just losing your studs and the character respawning in the exact same spot.",negative

4459,"As a primarily Phoenix Wright fan, and one who is not a huge fan of Layton games, I'd say:

-5 stars.  Great, great story, good 3D graphics, and great Phoenix Wright style courtroom action.  There are some more mature themes presented (capital punishment), so I would recommend that the players be Teen or older.

Less courtroom cases than standard Phoenix Wright games but each one is fantastically done.

The puzzles seemed overly easily and could at times impede the story flow, but most of them seemed skippable if desired.  Less puzzle frequency than a standard Layton game.

Game seems streamlined for the story, no heavy investigation scenes, and you can use hint coins to help decide what to do next (they are fairly plentiful, and helpful in some court cases, as it can be hard to determine what to do at times).

If you like Phoenix Wright or story games, definitely consider buying this one.  The game doesn't offer a ton of replay value, but the main story will take awhile to get through. [ I savored it and played a couple hours each night, which I'm finding is a really good way to enjoy that kind of game.]  And again, A+ storytelling.

4474,This game makes sport of doing some tricky maneuvers with the wii controllers and seeing if you can break the record. Some games are suitable for young children's skill level and others require more dexterity. Lots of fun and involves different motions than other wii games - definitely do recommend. Some games also appeal to boys who appreciate being grossed out.,negative

4480,"If your a fan of Street Fighter on ANY console or the arcade version, you will thoroughly enjoy this iteration of the street fighter series.  Although this title is called Street Fighter IV, there are well over 20 different variations of Street Fighter.  However, this is considered the 4th true installment of the series, given its complete overhaul of the engine and presentation.

And trust me, all the changes are for the better.  Overall, the game is simply a well executed, fully realized 3-d version of the legendary 2-d fighting game.  The game, whilst a tad slower than the gold standard of street fighting that is Street Fighter II Turbo, the game is still very action packed and dynamic!  Most of the original core street fighting cast is present in this game, with a few new characters thrown in as well.  Furthermore, in addition to the standard arcade mode, this version includes online play, as well as many time attack and other challenges to keep you busy.

With amazing graphics, 60 fps gameplay, and an extremely polished fighting engine, this game is truly a masterpiece.

Please get this for your 360 today!  Also, be sure to cop a fight stick or a fight pad to play this game.  This game does not play well with the standard 360 controller.",positive
4481,"Dead Reefs takes you back to the early 19th century and you are involved in mystery piracy and intrigue, the story starts with you arriving on a island for the govener to investigate a death, here the people believe in a curse set on them by a monk whoms ship they lured into a trap and crashed it on the rocks and sacked it,

this is where the story gets interesting, see the island used to be home to pirates, ( or is it still???)

certinly though you do not believe in Ghost and curses do you, well in dead reefs all that is about to change and all you believe in is about to change,

turn the lights down low and enjoy a true ghost story and the mystery of a life time and in the end be prepaired for you are about to meet the curse in person, ( can you handle it,)
not recommended for the week at heart

4485,"Ok, first off, I am a big Beatles fan. I consider them one of the best music groups to ever have come on the music scene. I am also a Rock Band Fan. Put these two factors together and you have one deliriously happy guy.

The game was actually a surprise for me. I envisioned that the game would just have the hit songs of the Beatles, and the standard parts for guitar, bass, vocals, and drums (my favorite). But what surprised me was the production value of the game. No, the graphics won't come close to Halo 3 or Gears of War...it isn't that sort of a game. What is cool is the ambiance the game produces. It features animations of the Beatles in different venues during their career, it has some nice cut scenes between the story line segments, and the audio of the music is quite good.

Playing with the Beatles, virtually of course, is a dream come true for anyone who is a big fan of the Beatles. There is a story mode which follows the career path of the Fab Four from the humble beginnings in The Cavern, a dingy underground nightclub, to big stadiums in New York and in Japan. The screaming fans add quite a lot of believability to the whole game.

If you are not a Beatles fan, or are not a connoisseur of their music, you probably will not ""get it"" or what it is all about. Basically it is a music game that takes you on a time trip back to the past and presents the Beatles as they were. The music parts are just great and you begin to appreciate some of the complexity of the harmonies and rhythms of the pieces. Ringo Starr has to be the most underrated drummer in history. Once you experience hard and expert, you begin to appreciate the talent of Ringo.

Which brings me to a surprise in the game. Some of the lesser known songs such as ""I want to be your man"" and others show off the tight harmonies that Paul, John, and George were able to produce. Oldies fans think the Beach Boys had tight harmonies, but listen to some of the songs of the Beatles and you'll see and hear what real tight harmony sounds like.

In short, I know this review is biased because I am a fan of the Beatles. As a fan, I score it a solid 5 for nostalgia and outright freaking fun. For non-fans, they'll give three stars and say, ""So what's the big deal?"" Too bad for the latter group because they've just dismissed one of the great experiences in music history.

Now I must go...I have to beat Paperback Writer on Expert Mode. :D",positive

4489,"great headset for PS3/PC games/movies/music sound great and the chat also sounds very nice through the speakers as well as the mic everyone i have played online with said the audio was very clear and easy to understand even if i'm talking with a low tone build quality is great fit over my ears and has no discomfort to the ears or to the top of my head where the head band and the foam padding is.

the foam padding around the ear cups is high quality very thick and extremely comfortable i wish that turtle beach would have added a foam background noise guard to the end of the boom mic very easy to pick up fan noise lots of other annoying sounds.

the cable from the PS3 to the sound control box is very thick heavy duty exact same cable that you'll find on a power extension cord the cord from the headset to the control box is thin and could develop a short or malfunction in the cord at some point the headset should be handled with care at all times the plastic used on this headset is very cheap and flimsy and it could break if thrown around.",neutral

from Windows XP to Windows 8.
Would buy again.",positive

4492,"Yes, it costs twice as much as the Windows version, and it took a while to come to the Mac... but it's here now, and it's still worth the price!

Graphics looks much better than the Xbox version, and best of all, you can play online for FREE (unlike Xbox Live).

Btw, the best mouse for this is NOT the MS one, but the Logitech G7.",positive
4493,"I was cautious of Fishing Resort, when a game is a new release and has a discounted price that is usually a red flag. But I ignored my ""spidey-sense"" and bought it (had to buy it with the rod, only one store in town had it and they only had one). I quickly discovered that I was wrong, Fishing Resort is a great game.

The beauty is in the simplicity: You're on vacation to Panagkapan Island (a tropical location that oddly has areas each with their own drastically different climate) and you're there to fish. The fish you catch earn you points (the currency on the island) and you use the points to buy new tackle and gear, as well as cloths for the character you create (you can't use you Mii, unfortunately). For those who want more substance, there are missions given by the other island-goers, daily activities to participate in (going trolling out in the ocean, catching specific fish for people, and competitions), as well as online leaderboards and new fish that are added via wi-fi (essentially, free dlc).

What I really enjoy is the cohesiveness: you wake up in your hotel room and make your way out to the beach. Don't want to walk? Purchase a bike for the day and go cycling. You never are required to accept missions or participate in extra activities (although it'll earn you more money), you can simply fish and enjoy the ambience. Too many fishing games I've tried are arcadey and break the immersion. This game embraces the quiet serenity of fishing.

As far as negatives go, the day night cycle is great but you're forced to go back to your hotel room when it gets too late (although eventually there is a way to stay out very late). The multiplayer is odd - when you're fishing you can add wii remotes and there will be another person fishing alongside you, whoever hooks first the camera zooms in on them as they reel in the fish. The fishing rod accessory works well...but I prefer playing without it. The motion controls really do work well (this game is actually motion-plus compatible, something not marked on the box) but casting my line doesn't always read.

It really is a fantastic game, and I know it will be overlooked. Obviously the publishers fealt the same way because the $20-$30 price is clearly not because of a lack of quality on the developers part. It's simply a great game with a great price.",positive
4494,"Max Payne is really a wonderful source of gameplay.  Best of all, for the PC version, there are tons of Modification sets that can be downloaded for free.  I highly recommend this game for that reason.  They really enhance gameplay in a way that cannot be done by the regular consoles.  Though at times it is repetative and you will sometimes forget why you're shooting the next 35 people, it's rather fun.",positive
4495,"Package was extremely well packed and shipped.  Case and game were in great shape.  This game is a wonderful rarity in an otherwise cluttered library that consists of many similar titles. I give the vendor and the game two thumbs up, highly recommend the purchase.",positive
4496,"The ingenuity of this game is amazing. You control little creatures called Pikmin. There are several types of Pikmin that you will meet throughout the game. The first type you will encounter is the Red. They are the best fighters, and are fire resistant. They drown when they are put in water (I learned this the hard way. THe second type is yellow. They have large ears and can fly higher than other Pikmin. They also can handle bomb rocks, which are used to knock down stone walls. The third kind are the blue Pikmin. They have gills and are water resistant. You start off with one type of each pikmin, then as you beat creatures,they drop pellets, which are made of nutrients from the things the creatures consume. The pikmin then team up to lift the carcass and pellets back to their onion, or  nest. Here, the objects are regenerated into Pikmin sprouts. If you let the seeds stay in the ground, they will grow into a bud and eventually a flower. When they have been grown fully, they are more efficient. There are 5 beautifully designed stages where the parts have been scattered. Which leads us to our plot. As the miniscule Olimar, you, along with the help of Pikmin, have to get to the rocket parts. You have 30 days to do this. You will see the sun move across the top of the screen, simulating time passing. Overall, the visuals are stunning, the creativity is unequaled, and the plot is great. The only thing that could have been better is the replay value, however challenge mode and the high scores may keep you in check for an extra week.",positive
4497,Cable was easy to hookup and use. Worked well the very first time and have it stored away if ever needed again. Well made and packaged.,positive
4498,"Tons of fun. Great characters. Relatively easy to learn. Story mode is a little too short, but that's just because it's so fun. The companion app ain't bad either. I wish I was better at fighting games so I could play this more.",negative
4499,I have seen some critical reviews and those reviews getting a lot of Helpful Votes. I do not want to speak for those gamers but I believe they would agree that the reason they gave it a lot of criticism is because they care and they love the game(s) and want to hopefully catch the attention of the Studio to fix these issues so that gamers who might be new to the franchise grow the same kinda love for the series as we have. HALO is the only reason I bought an XBOX ONE I had no desire honestly to pick up another console at all. But it started calling me back and like a crack head with out rock I got the shakes and the only fix was to once again play the crap out of each and every game like I did when they first came out. I remember standing in line for 2 hrs for midnight to hit on release day at my local Video Gaming Store good times and I'd do it again in a heart beat. All that nostalgic crap being said and all the technical issues being voiced and hopefully fixed or in motion to be fixed. These games imperfections and all should be the only reason to buy an XBOX ONE whether you have played them or not its worth every penny. These are my own personal opinion(s) but I think the majority of the critics and/or fans of the franchise would agree.,neutral
